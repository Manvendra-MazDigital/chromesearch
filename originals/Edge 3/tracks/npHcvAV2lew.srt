1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,100
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
Here's the panel

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,490
that you've been waiting
for after we had it hinted

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,230
in every other panel so far, and
the lots of questions and lots

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,940
of quick solutions
being thrown around.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,900
Like the last session,
for example-- when

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,280
will voice recognition
be the norm?

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,840
Just easy-- take people's
eyes out, take their arms off,

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,480
and they have to use
voice recognition.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,320
A lot of things that we
actually think is coming

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,220
had to be used in accessibility
for years and years already.

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,220
I always see accessibility as
a hard core usability testing.

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,692
It's something that people
need and not something

14
00:00:38,692 --> 00:00:39,775
that we just want to have.

15
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:41,860
But Derek is going to
do a better job in that.

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,140
My job is right now not to
talk but to introduce people.

17
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,250
So to first make
fun of the Germans,

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,360
let's have a family
name like Lewthwaite.

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,077
Sarah is here.

20
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:52,160
She's from King's College.

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,350
And she's an academic
researcher and writer bridging

22
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,430
the gap between critical
disability theory

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,160
and accessibility
practice, something

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,230
that was on our mind
for a long, long time,

25
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,950
and we've been discussing a
lot between us, hopefully.

26
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,170
Andrew Ronskley over
here is from the RNIB.

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,240
And he's an accessibility
and usability specialist

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,720
focused on the web
and mobile platforms.

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,440
He's also contributed to the
Surf Right standards, which

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,340
was an interesting
thing to look at.

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,530
Alice Boxhall is
from Google, but she

32
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,325
knows about accessibility.

33
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:24,810
[LAUGHTER]

34
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,810
OK, that was unfair.

35
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,810
But it was so good,
because everybody else

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,310
I talked to, she's
like, and here's Alice.

37
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,660
She's going to talk to you
later about accessibility.

38
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,320
So no pressure-- you have
to answer all the questions

39
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,250
right now.

40
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,950
She works on the
Accessibility Developer Tools

41
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,030
extension and library.

42
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,370
And that's something
like we used in the past.

43
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,664
We had performance tools
for developer tools.

44
00:01:44,664 --> 00:01:46,580
But now we have accessibility
testers in there

45
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,860
as well, which are great,
and absolutely necessary

46
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,310
for things like a
Chromebook where

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,280
you only have Chrome
on it and nothing else.

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,480
And Matthew Tylee Atkinson from
the Paciello Group over there

49
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,680
is from the Paciello Group,
a tester, screen magnifier,

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
and occasional text
to speech user.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
And he works on
web accessibility,

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,330
accessible gaming, which is an
interesting topic, especially

53
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,930
when you think about these
kinds of Kinect things, level

54
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,540
editing, and
supporting older users.

55
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,620
Old users-- is that a
political correct term?

56
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,380
I'm not sure.

57
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,540
So speaking of people that have
been around for a longer time,

58
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,980
I'm going to introduce you
now to Derek Featherstone, who

59
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,950
has been with me in
the accessibility world

60
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,260
for a long, long time and
worked on the first book

61
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,100
that we both had chapters in,
the web accessibility book

62
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,260
that two or four people read
and followed up later on.

63
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,110
So without further
ado, over to Derek.

64
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:51,540
[APPLAUSE]

65
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,660
DEREK FEATHERSTONE:
So I'm here today

66
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,090
to talk about accessibility.

67
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,250
And most people think
of accessibility

68
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,420
in very technical terms.

69
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,066
And the number one point
that I want everybody

70
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,440
to walk away from
this today with

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,580
is that accessibility
is all about people.

72
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,780
It has to be about people.

73
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,150
Because if it's
not about people,

74
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,910
we end up doing the wrong
thing even though we're

75
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,760
meaning to do the right thing.

76
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,890
So all of us that are up
here have a background

77
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,790
in doing this stuff for people.

78
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,320
So Christian actually
started his first foray

79
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,270
into understanding
accessibility when

80
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,240
he was working with
people with disabilities

81
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,750
when he worked
for the Red Cross.

82
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,340
Sarah is a researcher.

83
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,460
She actually works with real
people on accessibility issues.

84
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,980
Alice is putting ARIA
support into Chrome.

85
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,460
And that's for
people to use, right?

86
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,500
We cannot forget this.

87
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,940
Andrew actually
works with people,

88
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,890
taking smartphones to them
to show them and demonstrate

89
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,710
all the different accessibility
features of smartphones

90
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,310
and how those
things can actually

91
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,060
have an impact on
their day to day life.

92
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,780
And Matthew started changing
the authoring environment

93
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,730
for gaming so that that
could be accessible to people

94
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,350
that were blind.

95
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,810
And I do, too.

96
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,560
I work with people
with accessibility

97
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,190
with disabilities every day.

98
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,350
We do research and
testing and try

99
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,590
to figure out what UX is for
people with disabilities,

100
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,089
right?

101
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,519
What does UX mean to them?

102
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,500
And so hearing all the
things that everybody's

103
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,190
talking about this
morning and this afternoon

104
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,260
has been absolutely fascinating.

105
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,780
Because we're talking about
it at very technical levels.

106
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,850
But at the end of the day,
people have to use those tools.

107
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,710
And that to me is what
accessibility is all about.

108
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,780
We tend to simplify things.

109
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,850
And you probably
have heard of all

110
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,430
of these different conditions
or things that people have,

111
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,580
that people are blind or they
have low vision, they have

112
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,930
hearing difficulties,
or that they

113
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,645
have a mobility or a
dexterity impairment.

114
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:56,770
And when you start to think
of all of these things,

115
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,310
even those things seem
to be very physical.

116
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,320
But what about the
cognitive side of things?

117
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,360
And those are
traditionally the things

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,070
that we're thinking about when
we think about accessibility.

119
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,730
But there's a whole
other realm that we

120
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,191
need to start to get
into and explore.

121
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:13,690
How many of you
have heard of things

122
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,080
like vestibular disorders?

123
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,290
So there's a whole
group of people

124
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,170
that have some kind of
vestibular disorder--

125
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,330
and I don't even like the
word "disorder," but issues

126
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,630
with their balance.

127
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,700
And so when they're looking at
a screen with all your fancy CSS

128
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,860
animations and your
parallax effects,

129
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,230
that actually makes
them nauseous, right?

130
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,240
It actually causes migraines.

131
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,790
So when you're
scrolling down the page,

132
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,450
and you have a car
that you've animated

133
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,630
with CSS that's going like this
across the page, that actually

134
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,700
makes somebody nauseous, right?

135
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,730
These are new things that
aren't sort of in the mainstream

136
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,060
accessibility.

137
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,540
And we need to start to take
those things into account.

138
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,530
Things like speech--
the very last panel

139
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,550
was talking about,
well, what about speech?

140
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,440
And as Christian pointed out,
voice recognition software

141
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,610
was originally invented for
people with disabilities.

142
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,650
So on the speech side
of things-- and this

143
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,860
is I think an absolutely
critical thing for us

144
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,690
to keep in mind as
we move forward.

145
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,560
Speech is just one
modality, right?

146
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,240
What happens if we
create interfaces

147
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,374
that use that as
the only modality?

148
00:06:23,374 --> 00:06:24,790
And what does that
do for somebody

149
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,440
that speaks a different
language, that

150
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,690
has a stutter, that
maybe has cerebral palsy

151
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,550
and has difficulty
speaking, right?

152
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,030
We need to create interfaces
that are entirely flexible.

153
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,040
And one of the other
panels earlier,

154
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,130
the pointers-- what
about custom gestures?

155
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,250
Well, what about the fact that--
and so here's a custom gesture,

156
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,840
move up and to the left.

157
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Well, that custom
gesture is already

158
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,090
being used on Android for
screen reader users that

159
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,960
are using the talk back
screen reader on Android.

160
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,480
So what happens when
that custom gesture

161
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,300
that you've created and built
into your page conflicts

162
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,240
with the custom gesture that is
required for the screen reader?

163
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,820
So we need to think about
flexible alternatives.

164
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,360
So when I move up and left
in TalkBack in Android,

165
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,600
that means something to me.

166
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,120
And that gives functionality.

167
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,750
So even though you
create a custom gesture

168
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,540
like that in your
app or in your page,

169
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,240
you need to consider that maybe
that's not the only way that we

170
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,700
should be able to
instantiate that action.

171
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,510
Maybe we need some other
method or a backup mechanism

172
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,000
to do that.

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,790
We need to think about all
of these different things.

174
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,576
We tend to put people in
boxes and say, you're blind

175
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:36,700
or you're not blind, right?

176
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,500
You have a disability
or your don't.

177
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,570
But that is not reality.

178
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,950
We have a scenario-- and this
is a very standard Gaussian

179
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,060
binomial bell
curve distribution,

180
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,330
whatever you want to call it.

181
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,791
And we have people
that live at one

182
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,040
end of the extreme or another.

183
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,990
And this one's talking
about people's size.

184
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,060
But think of it in
terms of any ability.

185
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,690
So you have people on one end
that have maybe completely

186
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,330
normal vision, on the other
end people that have no vision.

187
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,700
And then, you have people
everywhere in between.

188
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,270
This is not a binary
all or nothing scenario.

189
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,370
And we need to think
about that all the time.

190
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,000
 

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,730
Today's assistive technology
is really advanced.

192
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,970
We've moved from a point where
solutions that we used to think

193
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,710
were completely
untenable, like ARIA.

194
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,880
So ARIA stands for Accessible
Rich Internet Applications.

195
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,530
And it's a tool that we
can use to add to our code

196
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,830
to provide programmatic
accessibility where it just

197
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,500
didn't exist before.

198
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,220
Screen readers for over
the last five years

199
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,460
have really advanced
and really done

200
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,679
a great job of getting ARIA
support into that technology.

201
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,420
But we have to ask this
kind of a question.

202
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,500
What if a brand new
version of a certain type

203
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,202
of assistive technology
just isn't modern?

204
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:55,410
And I'll give you an example.

205
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,270
This is a suite of
assistive technology tools.

206
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,540
We've got voice
recognition up there.

207
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,660
We've got tools
built into browsers.

208
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,520
NV Access is a screen reader
for the Windows platform that's

209
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,330
free, VoiceOver on the Mac.

210
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,740
ZoomText on Windows is
a magnifier and reader

211
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,000
combination.

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,090
Now, all of the screen
readers on there,

213
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,500
they have done a pretty
good job of keeping up

214
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,110
with modern technology.

215
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,450
But some other tools
don't necessarily keep up.

216
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,860
And so I'm not going to name
any names or single anybody out.

217
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,070
But Dragon NaturallySpeaking
is a great tool.

218
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,440
But it doesn't keep
up with the standards.

219
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,770
They haven't implemented
any support for ARIA.

220
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:46,974
And that's something that all
the screen readers have done.

221
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:49,390
I'll give you an example of
why that's actually important.

222
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,930
This is a very, very new
version of a Google map.

223
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,010
And these things on the
interface, the search button

224
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,820
and the zoom in
and the zoom out,

225
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,390
those things all used to be
divs with on-click handlers--

226
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,670
pretty straightforward
practice, very typical.

227
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:13,020
This is something where we
could actually improve that by

228
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,590
instead of just having
a div with an on-click,

229
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,660
we could actually give
that a role of button

230
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,600
so that a screen reader or other
piece of assistive technology

231
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,330
in theory could recognize that
that's a button so that there's

232
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,510
a more natural affordance
there that, hey, I can actually

233
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,620
click on this instead of it
just being a div in the page.

234
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,340
The beautiful
thing about this is

235
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,780
that-- and I just
literally saw this

236
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,770
with this new revision
of Google Maps--

237
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,450
there are actually now
buttons, like actual buttons.

238
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,090
Holy crap, there are
actually buttons.

239
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,410
And that totally
gets a gold star.

240
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,120
Because all the
semantics of a button

241
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,160
are already in that
native element, right?

242
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,070
This button could be used
by Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

243
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,270
The div with the role of
button can't be, right?

244
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,150
So there's a question about
whose responsibility is this.

245
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,115
There's a lot of people that are
pointing the finger at Dragon

246
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:11,280
and saying, you guys are wrong.

247
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,050
And I want you to
think about this.

248
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,350
From an ARIA perspective,
this is-- the last time

249
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,910
I stayed in London, I had
this in my hotel room.

250
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,984
This was a king size bed.

251
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:24,361
And so I had a sleep apparatus
with the role of king size bed.

252
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:26,360
But it was two twins with
a break in the middle.

253
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,480
 

254
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,470
Now, I complained.

255
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,070
I'm Canadian.

256
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,778
I don't complain.

257
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,720
So this was a big deal to me.

258
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,247
So I complain, and
I got a new room.

259
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:39,080
And I got a new bed.

260
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,190
And so in that bed, I
had a sleep apparatus.

261
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,960
And it was a king
with a class of posh.

262
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,140
I thought everything was great
until I dug a little further.

263
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,600
And I had a sleep apparatus with
the role of king size bed, two

264
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,990
twins with a break,
but the break

265
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,490
was styled to be display none.

266
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,920
 

267
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,540
If you remember nothing
else about ARIA,

268
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,590
remember that what's under the
sheets actually matters, right?

269
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,620
The tools and the code
that you use actually

270
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,470
have a huge impact on how
assistive technology can

271
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,710
interpret it and
work with it, right?

272
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,940
So thinking about
those kinds of things,

273
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,460
and thinking about
Dragon and how it works,

274
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,240
is it our job to be
responsible, even though we

275
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,850
have a tool like ARIA that
could really change your app?

276
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,330
Do we have a responsibility
to make some better choices

277
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,090
and actually use things
like real buttons,

278
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,500
or just better code in general?

279
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,300
My vote is yes.

280
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,900
But you'll find that out
in the next little while.

281
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,510
The other thing that people
are asking quite a lot

282
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,470
about these days is stuff about
detecting assistive technology.

283
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,737
And I want to know--
and as a developer,

284
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:53,820
you probably want to know.

285
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,990
I've heard it all morning.

286
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,340
I'd really like to
know, is this HTTP 1?

287
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,420
Is it HTTP 2?

288
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,200
Is it whatever?

289
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,410
Do we have the
capability to know?

290
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,080
And my question to you is,
if you could detect a screen

291
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,860
reader, what would you even
do with that information?

292
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,760
And there's some
real slippery slopes

293
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,670
that we go down when we do
that kind of stuff and say--

294
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,110
and I'll give you one example,
and then I'll shut up.

295
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,840
If we use a screen reader,
if we detect a screen reader,

296
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,440
we might inject a whole bunch
of extra hidden headings

297
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,470
that give some extra
context to a screen reader

298
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,710
user, which is kind
of a neat idea.

299
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,660
I think there's
some merit to that.

300
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,160
But we have to remember
that the only people that

301
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,351
use screen readers
aren't just blind.

302
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,850
There's all kinds
of people that use

303
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,290
screen readers for
literacy reasons.

304
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,290
And what's the impact on them if
they have a learning difficulty

305
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,690
if you're having a screen
reader read hidden headings

306
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,130
that they can't see
on the page, right?

307
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,790
So we need to think bigger.

308
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,400
We'll address a lot of
those kinds of questions

309
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,282
and more during the
panel-- thank you.

310
00:13:58,282 --> 00:14:05,667
[APPLAUSE]

311
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,250
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
Splendid, so we're

312
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,820
back to bed components instead
of web components-- not bad.

313
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,860
So we have a lot
of experts here.

314
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,330
We have seven questions
that we cut down on.

315
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,770
I'm supposed to get these
questions on some list here.

316
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,574
But that's not going
up at the moment.

317
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:22,490
What's going on there?

318
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:29,010
 

319
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,930
So-- oh, it's a tablet.

320
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,950
Look at that-- wonderful.

321
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,330
Touch interface-- and really
small and not resizable.

322
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,270
 

323
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,250
OK, so the first
question that we have

324
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,610
was a post by Andrew Betts.

325
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,696
But he doesn't want to
do it, so Melanie Lang.

326
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:53,095
MELANIE LANG: So it is,
what are the main offenders

327
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:55,330
of modern websites in
terms of accessibility?

328
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:01,390
 

329
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,000
What are the main offenders
of modern websites in terms

330
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,852
of accessibility and what
can be done to fix that?

331
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:09,310
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
So the question

332
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,810
is, like in many
cases, web developers,

333
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,460
we do things that
look beautiful.

334
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,350
And it's a barrier
for accessibility

335
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,220
without us even knowing it.

336
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,830
So I think we're going to
send that off to Matthew.

337
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,660
So Matthew, what have
you seen in your day

338
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,960
to day browsing
that drives you nuts

339
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,462
although people
think it's amazing?

340
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:29,545
MATTHEW TYLEE ATKINSON:
There's a few things.

341
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:30,920
I'm sure that
there's going to be

342
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,628
many examples from
the rest of the panel.

343
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:35,120
But I suppose a
personal [INAUDIBLE]

344
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,220
for me is disabling pinch
to zoom on mobile sites.

345
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,660
Because it just renders them
completely useless to me,

346
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,840
personally.

347
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,220
I'm vision impaired.

348
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,450
I can see well enough
to use the device,

349
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,750
but only if I've got control
of the size of things on it.

350
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,900
So that's a personal one.

351
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,130
I think something
to bear in mind

352
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,510
is that somebody that's using an
assistive technology to browse

353
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,280
a website, say, for
example, a screen reader,

354
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,850
but it doesn't limit it
to just a screen reader,

355
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,160
they can only perceive
one element at a time.

356
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,580
So they go through the
whole thing one element

357
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,530
by the next element until
they get to the end.

358
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,200
And a lot of stuff
in accessibility

359
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,260
is providing information such
that the assistive technology

360
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,870
can help the user get to the
bit of the page they want

361
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,170
to get to as
quickly as possible.

362
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,310
So a lot of stuff is
about saving the user time

363
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,620
and making sure that the
structure of the page

364
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,860
is conveyed, the
semantics are conveyed,

365
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,740
so that the user saves time and
can get to the bit they need.

366
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,550
So things like lack of skip
links, lack of headings--

367
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,350
visually, you can see
the layout beautifully.

368
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,650
But there's just no
semantic information

369
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,120
or no structural
information there.

370
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,390
That's very frustrating.

371
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,230
Because it might actually
be-- a trend on modern sites

372
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,710
is towards things
like simpler language,

373
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,830
fewer words on the
page, more focused.

374
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,690
It could be really good.

375
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,710
But sometimes people
forget the basics,

376
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,520
which is, just make sure that
you use HTML headings and lists

377
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,470
and stuff like that,
ARIA if necessary,

378
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,530
excuse me, and native
controls where possible,

379
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,380
so things that save people time.

380
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,490
And there is also an
article I read recently

381
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,680
about things that
just have to go away,

382
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,669
things like when you're asked
to enter a credit card number,

383
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:32,710
and you're asked, what
type of credit card is it,

384
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,810
and please remember
to put the dashes in,

385
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,760
or don't put dashes
in, or put spaces in,

386
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,870
telling the user
to do this stuff.

387
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,300
OK, for all of us,
that's really annoying.

388
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,960
It shouldn't be necessary.

389
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,980
It's just a number.

390
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,910
But for accessibility, people
facing extra accessibility

391
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,820
barriers, that sort
of stuff, having

392
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,150
to go back and correct it
because the instructions

393
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,100
weren't necessarily
there or correct,

394
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,040
that can really
take a lot of time.

395
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,940
And it's very frustrating.

396
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,920
So it's going back to
using sensible HTML,

397
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,720
building things the
way they used to work.

398
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,150
I remember when
browsers were bad,

399
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,232
you had to use the right
HTML or otherwise they

400
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:10,940
wouldn't show up.

401
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,642
Because there was
no CSS to a degree.

402
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:15,600
We don't use tables for
different weird things,

403
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
but that's a different story.

404
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,910
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: So Alice,
the shockingly innovative way

405
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,490
of using buttons instead of
divs with on-click handlers,

406
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,460
do you have to fight for
these kinds of things?

407
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,240
Is there a way that
developers are actually

408
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,130
assuming that things
work in the browser,

409
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,750
because the browser
fixes it for them,

410
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,430
and do we have to remind people
how to make things accessible?

411
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,170
ALICE BOXHALL: Well, yeah, if
you're using standard widgets,

412
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,754
by and large, it
should be accessible.

413
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,128
One of the big problems we
see is that people just simply

414
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:44,640
aren't using the
standard widgets.

415
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,370
And yeah, I'd very much
like to understand why.

416
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,629
My hypothesis is that you can't
style them the way you want.

417
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:54,170
So two problems-- one, you can't
style them the way you want,

418
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,770
or they don't behave
the way you want.

419
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,360
So one thing I
would like to see is

420
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,054
making it easier to style
custom elements the way

421
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:02,720
that we want to.

422
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,178
Because it's quite
difficult today.

423
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:06,620
It's a very simple
problem to solve, I think.

424
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,680
Secondly, make it easier for
developers to actually apply

425
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,740
that ARIA metadata
semantic information.

426
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,000
How can we get that
on the golden path

427
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,780
that we've been talking about
today, or the pit of success?

428
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,120
How can we make that
easier for developers?

429
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,700
I think that web
components possibly

430
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,580
has a big role to play here.

431
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,510
And I knew the team
is working on that.

432
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,025
Another idea would be to put
it into the developer tools

433
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:29,900
that we're all using.

434
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,950
So how can we expose the
accessibility information such

435
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,102
that it's impossible to ignore?

436
00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:36,810
DEREK FEATHERSTONE:
Wouldn't it be better

437
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,249
to make it harder to
put ARIA on stuff?

438
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:40,540
ALICE BOXHALL: How do you mean?

439
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,531
DEREK FEATHERSTONE:
Well, ARIA is

440
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:44,030
a great solution
for screen readers.

441
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,590
But it's not right
now for Dragon.

442
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,874
And I know in good conscience
that we don't use ARIA

443
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:53,290
unless we know that it's going
to get really good support,

444
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,123
and that we look for
other ways to do things

445
00:19:55,123 --> 00:19:56,940
while we're building things.

446
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,560
I almost would like
to make it better

447
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,010
to just use a button
than to add role

448
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,490
equals button on something.

449
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,300
ALICE BOXHALL: Yeah,
I completely agree.

450
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,810
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
We're coming back

451
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,750
to ARIA in an extra
question later on.

452
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,050
And I agree.

453
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,219
It's a tricky thing to actually
turn something into something

454
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:13,760
that it isn't when
there is something

455
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,843
that is already something.

456
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:18,660
But that's a different story.

457
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,750
So Andrew, what do
you see as crimes

458
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,590
that are happening that
actually make things

459
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,370
inaccessible on mobile
devices when people use HTML?

460
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,870
I found it interesting,
for example,

461
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,010
the unsightly Select box that
people hated on the desktop

462
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,710
and always wanted to style
is awesome on mobile devices.

463
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,269
ANDREW RONKSLEY: Yeah,
I think on mobile,

464
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:41,810
I think Matthew's
already covered it.

465
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,770
The biggest one is
disabling pinch to zoom.

466
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,260
I've had so many users come
to me with that problem.

467
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,645
I'm asking you,
why does my pinch

468
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:50,422
to zoom not work
on this website?

469
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:52,005
And it comes down
to the way we use it

470
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:53,620
in the meta viewport tag.

471
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,460
And we're all
using it to get rid

472
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,310
of the 300 millisecond delay,
which-- I guess in the past,

473
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,140
my advice would
be to developers,

474
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,540
think about how you use that.

475
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,332
But I guess now, going
forward, I'm thinking,

476
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,415
should people like myself
be getting more involved

477
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:11,980
with browser vendors
to say, OK, developers

478
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,920
are doing this-- Is there a
way that we can kind of cater

479
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,940
to both scenarios?

480
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,170
Rather than say to
developers, don't do that,

481
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,244
is there a way that
we can kind of get

482
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:22,410
this fixed through bugs for
the browsers, basically?

483
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:26,240
So that's probably
the biggest one.

484
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,280
I think on desktop,
the best bit of advice

485
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,580
I could give to
you guys would be,

486
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,380
try using the things you
build with a keyboard only.

487
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,330
So just recently, I was
working with someone

488
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,080
who's having a huge problem
with their online banking

489
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,117
where they couldn't complete
a payment to somebody.

490
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:45,450
Because it was using an overlay.

491
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,340
And whoever had built
that had clearly

492
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,134
thought about the
interaction with a mouse.

493
00:21:49,134 --> 00:21:50,800
Things behind the
overlay were disabled.

494
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,290
You couldn't click on them.

495
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,710
Well, because this user
was using the keyboards,

496
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,940
their interaction was
going wildly wrong.

497
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,470
And if the developer had
thought, OK, maybe what

498
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,430
if someone's not using
a mouse, they probably

499
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,580
would have found that
problem quite quickly

500
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,080
and could have done
something about it.

501
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,380
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: I'm very
excited that Jake Archebald has

502
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,565
a question, but we have to
move onto our next topic.

503
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:13,990
[LAUGHTER]

504
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,120
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: So Ross
Green has a question for us.

505
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,575
AUDIENCE: I've got it.

506
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:20,770
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
You're not Ross Green.

507
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,978
AUDIENCE: I'm not Ross Green.

508
00:22:21,978 --> 00:22:25,230
But Ross Green is not attending.

509
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,000
So he asked me to
ask the question.

510
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,700
And I'm also going to answer it,
because I've got a microphone.

511
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,230
Accessibility expectations
and requirements

512
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,800
are vastly different depending
on the user's world region.

513
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,120
What more could be
done to align them?

514
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,480
Example-- most EU rules
say don't autoplay media.

515
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,120
However, most US
media will autoplay.

516
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,305
The answer is don't
autoplay the media.

517
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:52,330
[LAUGHTER]

518
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,030
AUDIENCE: And a slight
snark is, well, EU rules

519
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,910
could be more widely
promulgated if the EU government

520
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,670
websites actually
obeyed their own rules.

521
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,100
But anyway, what
could be done to align

522
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,490
the different
territories' regulations

523
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,950
about accessibility?

524
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,450
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
So the good news

525
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,980
is that this was
hard to understand.

526
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,790
The question is-- basically
there's two folds to that.

527
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,140
There's differences between
accessibility guidelines

528
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,470
in Europe and in America.

529
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,936
And you have to--
for example, when

530
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:24,650
you do government websites,
when you do any website that

531
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,060
faces a lot of audience,
you have to apply with them.

532
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,010
You have to basically
apply the rules.

533
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,140
And they're different
from Europe to America.

534
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,690
As this world wide web
of ours is worldwide,

535
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,260
it's kind of confusing
to which ones to follow.

536
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,300
So are there ways to actually
get the legal requirements

537
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,930
more aligned with each other?

538
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,387
So maybe Sara, you could
tell us something about that.

539
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:49,720
SARAH LEWTHWAITE:The thing I
find interesting about this

540
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,990
question is it
refers to geography,

541
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,810
which I think is
really important.

542
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,425
Obviously, we know devices vary.

543
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:57,240
Our tools vary, and so forth.

544
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,960
But also, it's worth
understanding and thinking

545
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,410
about how disability varies
globally and internationally.

546
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,672
So we've already heard
a little bit about, say,

547
00:24:07,672 --> 00:24:09,130
the nature of
disability and how we

548
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,010
might want to conceptualize it.

549
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,710
But it's worth also, I think,
recognizing that disability

550
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,390
means different things in
different parts of the world.

551
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,350
Levels and types of
disabilities vary

552
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:25,060
depending on where you
are by locale, region,

553
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,690
as well as by nation.

554
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,040
So personally, I think
there's a bit of attention

555
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:37,130
in terms of picking a standard
to apply in all situations.

556
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,730
I think the great thing about
WCAG is that it's a guideline.

557
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,370
And when it's applied
as a guideline,

558
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,580
it allows perhaps for more of
that indigenous reflection--

559
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,000
the expertise of
local developers

560
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,500
to come into play as well.

561
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,410
So they can account, maybe,
for indigenous populations

562
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,160
with low literacy levels.

563
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,840
Or perhaps you have less
assistive technologies.

564
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,690
At the moment, there's
not a great deal

565
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,530
of data globally in terms
of the kinds of technologies

566
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,860
that disabled people are using.

567
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,720
But obviously,
WCAG in particular

568
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,210
is being picked up
because the UN convention

569
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,660
on the rights of persons
with disabilities

570
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,300
is being taken up by
more and more countries.

571
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,270
And people have this
kind of policy vacuum

572
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,755
in terms of information and
communication technologies

573
00:25:25,755 --> 00:25:27,505
that are referred to
in the UN convention.

574
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:31,400
And people want to make sure
that the policy is picking that

575
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,900
up.

576
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,550
So WCAG is being
applied more and more

577
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,890
as the kind of
verbatim standard.

578
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,440
But I think there is
a bit of attention

579
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,550
in terms of knowing what that
means, say, in Nepal or Uganda,

580
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,747
or more regionally.

581
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:48,580
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: It
is kind of confusing.

582
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,997
Because being an ex-German
developer and now living here,

583
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:54,330
there's different guidelines
even in Europe from country

584
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:54,960
to country.

585
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,742
So maybe in point
of the RNIB, I guess

586
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:00,700
you work with a lot of
people that come to say,

587
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,780
I don't want to be sued.

588
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,620
What can I do for people
with disabilities--

589
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,900
which is the awful, awful
question we keep getting.

590
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,200
What is your answer to that?

591
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,066
How do you get people to
understand that just applying

592
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:13,440
with the law does
not necessarily

593
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,020
make an accessible interface?

594
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,980
ANDREW RONKSLEY:
So I think for me,

595
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,010
there is a business case
behind accessibility,

596
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,390
which we'll often talk
to companies about,

597
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,320
around some potential
SEO benefits,

598
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,440
potentially opening
up to new markets.

599
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,990
And I think when I first
got into that sector,

600
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,040
or this sector,
sorry, I really did

601
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,840
believe in that business case.

602
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,950
And I still do.

603
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,170
But at the same time, it's
a little bit theoretical.

604
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,580
Because you don't have
many cases to back it up.

605
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,950
So Derek's point about, what
if we could detect a screen

606
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,419
reader-- I think
I'm with you, Derek.

607
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:52,460
I don't think it's a good
idea to detect a screen

608
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,720
reader if you're
going to do something

609
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
with that information
in terms of the website.

610
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,650
But I'd really like that
feature as part of analytics

611
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,670
so that we can say, OK, we made
some changes to the website.

612
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,820
And we can now see, perhaps,
screen reader users are not

613
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,555
dropping out midway through
the process of checking out,

614
00:27:10,555 --> 00:27:12,286
or something like that.

615
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:14,840
So I'd really like
that kind of stuff.

616
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,010
Because we don't have
many good case studies.

617
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,749
So while we can say, yeah,
maybe you can get more visitors,

618
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:22,790
we don't have any figures
really to back that up.

619
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,470
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
Yeah, Derek, you

620
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,410
used to work on that
for a long time as well,

621
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,910
like back in [INAUDIBLE] days
and things with like-- I mean,

622
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,451
we had guidelines
that said, you have

623
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:33,440
to have a certain kind of access
key on the page, for example.

624
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,550
And that was unenforceable
or usable, really.

625
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,591
DEREK FEATHERSTONE: Yeah,
there's a lot of things

626
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:40,510
in-- you have to remember
that especially when you

627
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,190
talk about guidelines,
accessibility guidelines,

628
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,150
and then talk about giving
them the force of legislation,

629
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,660
you're taking something that
is designed to be necessarily

630
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,920
fuzzy and putting it
into something that

631
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,040
becomes absolute
black and white.

632
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,560
And I would even
respond to Bruce.

633
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,564
We all said-- everybody laughed.

634
00:27:58,564 --> 00:28:00,730
He said, well, the simple
answer is do not autoplay.

635
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,470
And I would counter that
by saying that autoplay

636
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,080
can actually be useful for
certain types of people,

637
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,680
including people that have
mobility difficulties.

638
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,170
It may be actually
much easier for them

639
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,649
if you do autoplay so that when
you go to a new video page,

640
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:15,940
it actually does play for them.

641
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,280
They don't have to try and
work hard to actually get

642
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,190
it to play.

643
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,600
So when we're
embedding a YouTube

644
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,180
video or a whatever
video on a site of ours,

645
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,190
we always recommend,
have it embedded

646
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,510
and don't autoplay that one.

647
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,740
But also, link to the
YouTube page outside.

648
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,550
Because then, the
user has a preference

649
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,910
to set it up so that my videos
on YouTube always autoplay.

650
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,260
So we're kind of catering
for both things there.

651
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,950
So the edicts like,
do not autoplay,

652
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,360
they sound really good.

653
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,530
But they don't necessarily
always make sense.

654
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,420
Autoplay is bad for everyone
except for the people

655
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:50,962
that need it.

656
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,711
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
OK, we have a question

657
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:53,932
from Christopher Emery.

658
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,973
CHRISTOPHER EMERY: I just
wanted to kind of chime

659
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:58,517
in just with regards to
going about our differences

660
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:03,990
between EU law and
US law-- so yeah,

661
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,412
the difference between
the EU and US law.

662
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,870
Just with regards
to my experience,

663
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,480
I found that it's actually
even more complicated.

664
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,640
Because the requirements
suggest we don't just

665
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,802
live in the government
legislature.

666
00:29:14,802 --> 00:29:16,510
For example, when you
get to a client who

667
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,880
reaches a level where
they're now rolling out

668
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,462
in different markets,
they will then

669
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:21,420
have their own accessibility
requirements layer

670
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,187
within that which typically
will be based on one market,

671
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:25,770
even though they're
rolling out local.

672
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,116
I mean, that's my
experience, even

673
00:29:27,116 --> 00:29:28,616
though they're
rolling out globally.

674
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:30,920
So we've actually
encounter situations

675
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,400
whereby we're using,
in one example, the EU

676
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,155
accessibility guidelines,
even though we're rolling out

677
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:41,420
in the UAE or in China
and things like that.

678
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,520
And that becomes a very
weird, strange situation.

679
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,550
Because the document
a lot of times

680
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,260
that the accessibility was kind
of created at the companies in

681
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,105
was, check off a
box to say, yes,

682
00:29:51,105 --> 00:29:52,710
we have accessibility
guidelines.

683
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,845
But they didn't roll it
out to the market level.

684
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:59,800
So I just wanted to say, on top
of the government legislature,

685
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,700
there's the actual
corporate layer as well.

686
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,350
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: It's a
super tricky all-in-all problem.

687
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,167
And the issue is a lot of
people try to sell accessibility

688
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,500
as something you could be
sued if you don't do it right.

689
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,440
But then, we don't have the
answer how to do it right.

690
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,230
It's like getting
someone's attention

691
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,540
by kicking them in the shins.

692
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,220
Yeah, you have their attention
but not their support.

693
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,250
So Shane Hudson has
a question for us

694
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,540
on this, not the
kicking but general.

695
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,310
He's there, the man
in the striped shirt.

696
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:33,511
 

697
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:36,630
SHANE HUDSON: So
are the WCAG-- I

698
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,940
have trouble saying
that-- guidelines

699
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,015
redundant in a world of
smartphones and tablets?

700
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:43,960
Are accessibility laws trying
to fix an outdated world?

701
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,660
It's kind of been touched upon.

702
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,280
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Yeah, kind
of-- so basically, the question

703
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,210
is, the WCAG guidelines
define a lot of stuff,

704
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,180
for example, keyboard
accessibility, which

705
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,130
is on a touch device a bit
of a weird thing to enforce.

706
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,210
So do they need to be upgraded?

707
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,330
Do we need to think about
different form factors?

708
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,166
I think the best would be
just-- Sarah, what do you think?

709
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:07,540
SARAH LEWTHWAITE:
I think this is

710
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,730
a problem with the
nature of standards.

711
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,810
And there's quite a
lot of interesting

712
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:14,890
writing about what
standards do outside

713
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,810
of development communities.

714
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,592
So for example, they
offer a fixed perspective,

715
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:24,550
which is what I think
some of us are struggling

716
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,650
with in the sense
that disability

717
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,450
is so heterogenic that
it needs to sort of be

718
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,740
as inclusive as possible.

719
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,570
And a standard rather than
a guideline is difficult.

720
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,780
So I think, yeah, there are
these problems about how

721
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,740
it keeps abreast
of new developments

722
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,951
which we can't
necessarily foresee.

723
00:31:43,951 --> 00:31:46,200
But I think one of the things
which I find interesting

724
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,620
is that standards also
convey certain values.

725
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,890
And as I say, when they're
being picked up internationally,

726
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,660
it's useful to
recognize that they also

727
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,750
promote the rights of
people with disabilities.

728
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,570
And they promote their
access to technology

729
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:07,890
and raise a kind
of whole argument

730
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,750
about human rights, disability
rights, which isn't necessarily

731
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,650
reflected in all the communities
that these standards touch

732
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,309
upon.

733
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,850
So that's one of
the things, I think,

734
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,340
which we need to also
keep front and center.

735
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,340
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
Matthew, in terms of gaming,

736
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,410
the Paciello Group does a great
job in explaining on their blog

737
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,710
how to apply WCAG guidelines,
how to apply best technologies.

738
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,930
And most people start
with a blank canvas

739
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,240
with no keyboard accessibility
whatsoever for their game.

740
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,420
So do you think that
the WCAG is outdated?

741
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,114
Are we fixing the web from 1997
rather than the web from 2005?

742
00:32:42,114 --> 00:32:44,530
MATTHEW TYLEE ATKINSON: A
couple of things-- first of all,

743
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,800
the gaming stuff is
separate to my TPG stuff.

744
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,336
But I'm very happy to
talk about it, of course.

745
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:51,530
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Yeah,
don't get fired over it.

746
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,970
MATTHEW TYLEE ATKINSON: Sarah
made a really good point

747
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,250
last night, which I just
wanted to make sure came up,

748
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,300
which is that a
screen reader could

749
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,360
be a person next to
you reading what's

750
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,410
on the screen in a
particular place.

751
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,660
You were saying about
different countries have

752
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,520
different social views of
accessibility and different

753
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,670
access to ATs.

754
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:13,580
And therefore, screen
reader detection

755
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,490
would have to encompass
reading glasses

756
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,680
and people sat next
to you as well,

757
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,810
and both of these at
the same time, perhaps.

758
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,125
Anyway, moving on to answering
the actual question--

759
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,372
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Thanks.

760
00:33:23,372 --> 00:33:25,690
[LAUGHTER]

761
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,690
MATTHEW TYLEE ATKINSON:
A couple of points-- one

762
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,920
of them is that if
you look at WCAG--

763
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,090
and there's a lot to read.

764
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,650
But the central point
that it's trying

765
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,846
to get across, and the
values that Sarah mentioned,

766
00:33:38,846 --> 00:33:40,470
they're actually
written down in there.

767
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,100
They are the POUR principles
that your content needs

768
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,790
to be Perceivable, Operable,
Understandable, and Robust.

769
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,825
And you can look
up what those are,

770
00:33:51,825 --> 00:33:53,550
but you get the general idea.

771
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:58,170
You can apply those kinds
of principles to any medium.

772
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,140
Now, some of the
WCAG stuff might

773
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,110
be less appropriate
on mobile, some

774
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,250
of the very specific
technical stuff.

775
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,960
But a lot of the guidelines--
in fact, all of them--

776
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,090
are written with those
four principles in mind.

777
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,250
And you can apply
those to any medium.

778
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,530
So in terms of
game accessibility,

779
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,090
that is about making sure
that you know what information

780
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:25,670
is important to someone to
be able to play this game.

781
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,949
What is the best way to present
it to the particular audience

782
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,639
that you're thinking about?

783
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,139
In our case, it
was blind people.

784
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:37,770
So it was making a lot of
visual cues auditory instead.

785
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:41,610
Understandable--
well, it's got to be

786
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,110
understandable to be able
to be enjoyable in the case

787
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,980
of a game.

788
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,679
And in the case of
a banking website,

789
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,630
it's got to be understandable
in order to be able to use it.

790
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,810
And robust-- that covers
the kind of security

791
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:55,562
and reliability stuff on
the website side of things.

792
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:57,020
And on the game
side of things, you

793
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,470
don't want it to crash
just before you're

794
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,636
going to complete the level.

795
00:34:59,636 --> 00:35:04,352
So very briefly, that is
a very glib high level

796
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,810
trying to demonstrate
you can apply

797
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,470
these things to multiple areas.

798
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,886
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
So Alice, when

799
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:12,300
you put that into the Developer
Tools Accessibility panel--

800
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,620
those of us who have been
in accessibility long enough

801
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,764
remember Bobby Approved and
people putting triple A badges

802
00:35:17,764 --> 00:35:19,180
on their website,
which ironically

803
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,530
didn't have an alternative text.

804
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,554
[LAUGHTER]

805
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,470
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: What
are the testing tools

806
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,630
that you have in there?

807
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,090
Do you get, this doesn't
apply with that guideline?

808
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,990
Or is it more of a
transcription of the perceivable

809
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,430
and-- the ideas of it?

810
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,272
Because it's easy for
a developer to say,

811
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:38,480
oh, I'm now accessible,
because I tick all the boxes.

812
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,740
But what does it really mean?

813
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,574
What kind of a test
would help people there?

814
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,281
ALICE BOXHALL: So one
point that I always

815
00:35:43,281 --> 00:35:45,410
try to make with the
accessibility developer tool

816
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,392
is that passing a mechanical
accessibility audit

817
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:50,100
does not in any way
guarantee that you're

818
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,175
completely accessible.

819
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:52,800
It's only looking at
the things that we

820
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,560
can test programmatically,
which is a subset.

821
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,230
That said, what it does look at
are things like color contrast.

822
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,770
It tries to look
for click targets

823
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:07,846
and suggests that you should use
an ARIA role and a [INAUDIBLE].

824
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:09,435
It also looks for
valid ARIA use.

825
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:12,452
 

826
00:36:12,452 --> 00:36:14,286
Yeah, so those are
sort of the main things

827
00:36:14,286 --> 00:36:15,160
that it's looking at.

828
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,040
 

829
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,191
Yeah, but one point I did
want to make just to follow on

830
00:36:22,191 --> 00:36:25,780
is that the robust in
perceivable, optimal,

831
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,320
understandable, robust
actually encapsulates

832
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,530
working in different modalities,
which actually implies that it

833
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,450
should work on
different devices.

834
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,600
So when we're talking about
mobile, tablet, even something

835
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,110
like Google Glass
or TV or a Leap,

836
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,880
robust encapsulates all of that.

837
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,130
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Good,
Matthew, you had a question,

838
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,200
or you're pulling it?

839
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,730
She covered everything you do?

840
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,200
I just want to show that
somebody from Google

841
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,908
has something to say
about accessibility.

842
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:56,220
MATTHEW: No, I was going to
ask, since you're all there--

843
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,295
[LAUGHTER]

844
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:58,920
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
As I have you here.

845
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,380
MATTHEW: So I once
made a comment

846
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,420
about changing an outline in
CSS and basically changing

847
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,740
the background
color for the focus.

848
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,180
I got slated immediately
on [INAUDIBLE] for this.

849
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,910
It's not accessible.

850
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,990
And I'm fine with that.

851
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,599
And I'm kind of like, well,
what is the right way to do it?

852
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,390
And there's a part of
me that's like, well,

853
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,880
can't I apply filters to
my site that say, this

854
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,435
is what a screen
reader will see?

855
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:24,570
Or what should I be doing in my
workflow that basically helps

856
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,904
me as a developer make my
site more accessible, I guess?

857
00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:28,570
Are there tools?

858
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,028
Is there something
you'd recommend?

859
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:32,210
Or is it just a case of,
use native components,

860
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:36,180
use the accessibility
thing, and use that?

861
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,800
DEREK FEATHERSTONE: So
using-- 75% of all statistics

862
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,410
are made up.

863
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,340
So you can get probably--

864
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,340
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: 2 out
of 7 people know that.

865
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:52,140
DEREK FEATHERSTONE: Yeah,
you can get 80 to 90%

866
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,750
of the way accessible by testing
everything with a keyboard.

867
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,330
And you have to
manually test that.

868
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,454
Because that's interaction.

869
00:37:58,454 --> 00:38:01,950
There's no way to test
it other than that.

870
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:07,760
But dealing with straight up
good, solid semantic markup--

871
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,230
just writing good HTML and not
screwing up keyboard access

872
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,670
gets you 80 to 90%
of the way there,

873
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,940
straight up, honest truth.

874
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,440
Now, using it with a keyboard
is going to show you stuff

875
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,410
about your outline
changes, right?

876
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,124
You're going to go
through and you're

877
00:38:24,124 --> 00:38:25,832
going to say, shit,
I can see the cursor.

878
00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:27,314
I have no idea where I am.

879
00:38:27,314 --> 00:38:29,730
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: I have to
stop this cursing right now,

880
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,230
actually.

881
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,440
And this is a longer
topic that we could go on.

882
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,540
So I'm moving on to
actually Ed Soden, which

883
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,910
is actually covering this a bit.

884
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,140
So Ed Soden has a question.

885
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,431
ED SODEN: I'm reading this one.

886
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:44,040
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Yeah,
Mr. Snowden, ah, Soden--

887
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,010
was I not allowed to say it?

888
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,470
ED SODEN: So as developers, we
often try and make our sites

889
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,850
work well for screen readers.

890
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,597
But is there anything else we
can do besides screen readers

891
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,680
when we're designing our
sites to make them better

892
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,077
for accessibility?

893
00:38:57,077 --> 00:38:59,660
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: That is an
incredibly interesting question

894
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,630
that we haven't quite covered
yet, or just did, or tried.

895
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,390
So Andrew, what do you think?

896
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,265
The big screen reader
debate, every developer

897
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:10,265
I talk to like, it works
from the screen reader,

898
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,870
because that's something I can
test with-- what else should we

899
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,269
be thinking about?

900
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,060
ANDREW RONKSLEY: No,
it's a great question.

901
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,050
And I could make up some stats
now, but I'm not going to.

902
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,480
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Go ahead.

903
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,938
ANDREW RONKSLEY:
In the UK, there's

904
00:39:22,938 --> 00:39:24,950
around 2 million
people that have

905
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,580
some kind of
sight-related issue.

906
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,970
And the vast majority
of those have

907
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,834
some residual useful vision.

908
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:33,500
So the thing you can
take away from that

909
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,710
is quite a small percentage
of those 2 million people

910
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,100
are using the screen reader.

911
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,980
The rest of them are making
some kind of visual adaptations

912
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,800
to the page.

913
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,440
And I think you can extrapolate
that to around the world

914
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,050
issues.

915
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,800
So I think around the
world it's something

916
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,210
like 280 million people have
some sight-related issue.

917
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:55,100
So things that you
can do that are not

918
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,255
related to a screen
reader-- and this kind of

919
00:39:58,255 --> 00:39:59,130
applies to all of us.

920
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,860
You think about using a
website out and about,

921
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,850
color contrast, the
size of your font,

922
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,910
how much white space
is between controls.

923
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,920
So when he's using
a screen magnifier--

924
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,260
I'll see sites sometimes
where there's a form.

925
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,820
And maybe, there's two buttons
at the end, Next and Previous.

926
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,250
They're really far
apart from each other.

927
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,250
If someone's using
a screen magnifier--

928
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,384
I think Matt kind of
touched on this before.

929
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:25,550
It's a little bit different
with a screen magnifier.

930
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,227
But you see a portion of
the screen at any one time.

931
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,310
Those of you-- everyone
pretty much has Macs here.

932
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,980
You'll all have a screen
magnifier built-in, Windows

933
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,480
as well.

934
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,530
So you can try this
out if you want.

935
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,210
Another way to think about it is
if you imagine sliding a credit

936
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,480
card around your screen, just
imagine that was your viewport.

937
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,080
So if the buttons are far apart,
there's potential to miss them.

938
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,910
So just that kind of stuff
is worth thinking about.

939
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,219
And that's nothing to do
with screen readers at all.

940
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:53,510
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Yeah,
and that's a very good point.

941
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,380
I love the credit card thing.

942
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,747
I didn't think about that yet.

943
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:57,830
My favorite is always when
people-- now everything

944
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,288
comes with screen
readers, which is

945
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:01,050
great for accessibility
for people.

946
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,289
But it also is kind of bad.

947
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:04,830
Because developers think they
know how these things work now.

948
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,496
The amount of people I see using
a screen reader with their eyes

949
00:41:07,496 --> 00:41:09,100
open is amazing.

950
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,760
And that defeats the purpose.

951
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,096
Because of course you can
understand your system.

952
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,595
So James [INAUDIBLE]
has a question,

953
00:41:14,595 --> 00:41:16,654
or was that already
about the last topic?

954
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:18,570
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that was
about the last topic.

955
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,980
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: OK, good,
so do you have another one?

956
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,940
MELANIE LANG: I was
wondering if maybe we

957
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,772
need to be more creative
and maybe go back to roots

958
00:41:26,772 --> 00:41:28,896
and test-- I don't know--
[INAUDIBLE], for example,

959
00:41:28,896 --> 00:41:31,090
the test set aside
for old people.

960
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,610
I think they put
Vaseline on glasses

961
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:38,100
and put gloves on to
simulate arthrosis.

962
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,850
Yeah, so maybe, do we need
to go back and just do that,

963
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,570
maybe, and go this extra mile?

964
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,750
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Testing
this kind of way works.

965
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,519
I gave people broken
mice to actually use

966
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:49,810
the website, for example, with.

967
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,010
DEREK FEATHERSTONE: Yeah,
there's tons of things

968
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,110
that you can do like
that to simulate

969
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,830
different types of disability.

970
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,310
And I believe that
all those things

971
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:04,050
are great emulating what a
user with a particular type

972
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,290
of disability would be.

973
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,590
You want to see what
it's like for somebody

974
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,510
that has a tremor in
their hand to use a mouse,

975
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:16,640
turn your mouse sideways and try
to manipulate it on the screen,

976
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,740
or use the wrong hand.

977
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,720
There's all kinds of
things that you can do.

978
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,410
One thing that I would point
out-- and I think those

979
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,420
are great things to do.

980
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,610
The WCAG guidelines are designed
specifically because we know--

981
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,490
and I say "we" like I was
involved or something.

982
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,980
But we can't all go and
test with real people.

983
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,690
And so those guidelines
are all in place

984
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,440
because they're based on
years and years of people

985
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,490
actually working with
people with disabilities.

986
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:48,940
So those are absolutely
valuable and useful.

987
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,620
And everybody should do it.

988
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,830
But if you can't
do that, then you

989
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,730
have guidelines as your sort
of first point of advice.

990
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,710
And absolutely go back to it.

991
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:03,040
But if you can't, just feel
at least partially confident

992
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,540
that those guidelines
are there to replace

993
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,330
the fact that everybody
can't do that.

994
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,570
ALICE BOXHALL: Actually-- oh.

995
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,375
SARAH LEWTHWAITE: I
completely understand

996
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:13,416
where you're coming from.

997
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:16,220
But I also feel that's a bit
of a cop-out in terms of-- I

998
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,324
think sometimes
standards step in,

999
00:43:18,324 --> 00:43:20,490
and people want to learn
the standard because that's

1000
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,690
the easy thing to do.

1001
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,620
And they want to turn the mouse
and do that when sometimes,

1002
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,400
they have disabled populations
sitting right under their nose.

1003
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,650
So for example, in
the university sector,

1004
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,280
there are hundreds
of disabled students

1005
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,410
at King's College, London.

1006
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,597
How many are involved
in testing our systems?

1007
00:43:34,597 --> 00:43:35,430
They're right there.

1008
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,280
We could easily
engage with them.

1009
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,930
So I think it's important
to be creative and think

1010
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:44,314
about drawing people
into this conversation.

1011
00:43:44,314 --> 00:43:46,230
So if you're doing
usability testing at large,

1012
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,280
don't be afraid of contacting,
say, disabled people's

1013
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,165
organizations or
putting a call out

1014
00:43:51,165 --> 00:43:53,290
for people to get involved
in testing your systems.

1015
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,340
Because they will
give you much richer

1016
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,520
feedback about how
your interfaces work.

1017
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,020
And they're going
to bring up things

1018
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,397
that you just would not
have imagined possible.

1019
00:44:02,397 --> 00:44:04,480
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: It
would be interesting to see

1020
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,350
what kind of-- I mean, you
can take the glasses away

1021
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,780
from your colleagues,
for example.

1022
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,910
Or you can read out
your text on the screen

1023
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,010
to somebody on the phone.

1024
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,050
If it then makes sense, you
know it's an accessible text.

1025
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,845
If you need to think to see to
understand it, then you don't.

1026
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:19,220
It would be
interesting to set up

1027
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,090
a wiki or something about these
little accessibility hacks

1028
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,400
to simulate different things.

1029
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,810
But outreach to real
people with disabilities--

1030
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:30,090
hard core users that know how
to use something is amazing.

1031
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,579
I learned most working next
to a PHP developer, who

1032
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:33,870
was blind, for like four years.

1033
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,078
And that was just incredible.

1034
00:44:35,078 --> 00:44:38,250
Because he coded faster
than me, which is annoying.

1035
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,180
Now, with a sense of dread,
Patrick Lauke has a question.

1036
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,827
[LAUGHTER]

1037
00:44:43,827 --> 00:44:45,660
PATRICK LAUKE: No, I
haven't got a question.

1038
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,868
I've got a lengthy statement.

1039
00:44:46,868 --> 00:44:49,610
No, just a quick note--
I wanted to pick up just

1040
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:52,750
on something that was mentioned
at the start there about,

1041
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,770
I did something to my
outline, and I was immediately

1042
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:01,920
jumped upon by an
accessibility lynch mob.

1043
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,100
The dirty kind of truth, even
within the Paciello Group--

1044
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,310
I can say that
hopefully openly--

1045
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,300
is that you get three
accessibility experts,

1046
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,940
you get five different opinions.

1047
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,280
We disagree even on sometimes
very fundamental things,

1048
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,780
like very first
guideline of WCAG,

1049
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,465
having appropriate alt text.

1050
00:45:20,465 --> 00:45:22,950
We could have discussions
for days about,

1051
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,990
what is the most appropriate
alt text for this?

1052
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,880
And you'll get fierce debates
in the accessibility community

1053
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,580
about, every image should
have this kind of alt,

1054
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,810
or no image should have alt.

1055
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,805
And so I just wanted to
kind of temper the whole--

1056
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:37,805
when you get some
people jumping on you

1057
00:45:37,805 --> 00:45:41,440
and immediately shouting,
oh, that's not accessible,

1058
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,830
they may be right.

1059
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:44,380
Or they may not be right.

1060
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,670
And as Derek mentioned
towards the start,

1061
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,480
it is not a binary thing.

1062
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,814
It's not always, it's either
accessible or inaccessible.

1063
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,271
There are certainly
things that you

1064
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:54,480
can do that completely
screw everybody over that

1065
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,830
can't see the screen
perfectly and use their mouse.

1066
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:00,886
But beyond that, there's lots
of shades of grey on that one.

1067
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:03,560
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Yeah,
also, stop arguing on Twitter.

1068
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,660
140 characters are not
good to actually bring

1069
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,920
emotions or facts in.

1070
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,040
We've got [INAUDIBLE]
here, because Christopher

1071
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,710
has said too many
things already.

1072
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:17,754
 

1073
00:46:17,754 --> 00:46:19,920
AUDIENCE: So basically, I
did a bit of a stat check.

1074
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,770
And I checked that there
are about 2.7 million people

1075
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,930
in Britain who have
color blindness.

1076
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,980
And I haven't seen that
mention in this talk yet.

1077
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,830
Do we consider people who are
color blind to be disabled,

1078
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,540
or are there any things
that people in general

1079
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,351
can do to improve their pages
to improve the looks for color

1080
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:37,850
blind?

1081
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:38,840
DEREK FEATHERSTONE:
Did you say stable?

1082
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,298
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: I met a
few unstable color blind people

1083
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,340
in my past.

1084
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:48,130
I think your tools,
Alice-- you talked

1085
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:51,140
about the color distance.

1086
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,355
But also, color blindness
is one of the simulators

1087
00:46:53,355 --> 00:46:54,665
in there, isn't it?

1088
00:46:54,665 --> 00:46:56,710
ALICE BOXHALL: No, not
in my tool, actually.

1089
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:59,193
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
Well, that can be fixed.

1090
00:46:59,193 --> 00:47:01,600
ALICE BOXHALL: Sure, you want
to send me a [INAUDIBLE]?

1091
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,121
There are extensions
certainly for Chrome, probably

1092
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,495
for other browsers
as well, which

1093
00:47:05,495 --> 00:47:08,190
will simulate color blindness.

1094
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:13,160
And contrast ratio has a color
blindness implication in that,

1095
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,990
say, if you have red on white,
if you view that as grey,

1096
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:20,524
it may not be a high
enough contrast ratio.

1097
00:47:20,524 --> 00:47:22,440
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
Derek, you were twitching?

1098
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,400
DEREK FEATHERSTONE:
A little-- there's

1099
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,200
a great tool,
Color Oracle, which

1100
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,046
you can install at
the desktop level.

1101
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,420
And it will
transform everything.

1102
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,120
And you can simulate things.

1103
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,055
 

1104
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:36,930
Two challenges with
color blindness-- and I'm

1105
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,600
saying this as a very
blanket statement.

1106
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,510
So there's probably
more challenges.

1107
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,020
But one is a color
contrast issue.

1108
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,160
The other is the way
that you're using color

1109
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,470
to convey information, right?

1110
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:49,400
If you're relying on color, then
you need to-- we're not saying,

1111
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,540
don't rely on color.

1112
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,790
Use color as much as you want.

1113
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:55,170
But use other mechanisms
to indicate things as well.

1114
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:59,270
So it could be that you're
using pattern with color.

1115
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,800
Or instead of just
using color, think

1116
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,050
of a line graph that has
a legend at the bottom.

1117
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,330
Instead of putting a
legend at the bottom,

1118
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:11,790
change your graph so that each
one of the individual legend

1119
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,680
pieces is actually
up beside the line

1120
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,809
so that you can then
follow the line.

1121
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,350
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: This also
ties into internationalization.

1122
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,570
My favorite is when people
just use red as a warning,

1123
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,251
whereas in China,
it means good luck.

1124
00:48:22,251 --> 00:48:24,000
Good luck, we lost
your emails, wonderful.

1125
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,444
[LAUGHTER]

1126
00:48:26,444 --> 00:48:28,360
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Oh
god, lots of questions.

1127
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,765
So let's have one here,
the man in the loud shirt.

1128
00:48:32,765 --> 00:48:36,760
 

1129
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,530
AUDIENCE: Sorry about my shirt.

1130
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,980
I was just thinking,
we've talked

1131
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,110
a lot today about
web performance

1132
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:46,590
and things like that, and about,
how does the whole performance

1133
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,800
piece fit into accessibility?

1134
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,700
We'll see one kind of coming
to mind as things being too

1135
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:56,530
fast where we're constantly
working to speed things up.

1136
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,920
Is there cases in
accessibility where we actually

1137
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,130
need to slow it down?

1138
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:05,790
DEREK FEATHERSTONE: So
I have a few thoughts

1139
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:08,040
when listening to all the
other performance things.

1140
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,620
And one of the
things that I heard

1141
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,955
was, what's in the
first 15 kilobytes?

1142
00:49:12,955 --> 00:49:16,649
And I started to think, what
should be in the first 15

1143
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:18,690
kilobytes for somebody
that has a particular type

1144
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,520
of disability?

1145
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,394
And I don't know the
answer to that question.

1146
00:49:21,394 --> 00:49:23,710
I think that's a great one.

1147
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,300
I'm not sure about
slowing things down.

1148
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,440
Most technology, most
screen reading technology

1149
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,550
and other technologies, they
work on top of browsers.

1150
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,740
They're not their own
thing, generally speaking.

1151
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,085
 

1152
00:49:40,085 --> 00:49:41,710
AUDIENCE: Where I'm
kind of coming from

1153
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,980
is about the thought
of perception,

1154
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,820
if something changes on
the screen too quickly,

1155
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,520
and it becomes harder for
visually impaired people

1156
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,567
to actually detect that change.

1157
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:56,900
DEREK FEATHERSTONE: So are
you talking about in response

1158
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,740
to some event that's
happened on the page,

1159
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,364
or like an initial load?

1160
00:50:01,364 --> 00:50:03,780
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Is it more
like UX problems, isn't it?

1161
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,770
I think like drop-down--

1162
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:05,782
AUDIENCE: Something
like a carousel.

1163
00:50:05,782 --> 00:50:07,060
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: Yeah.

1164
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:11,260
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just a
case of stuff changing,

1165
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:15,420
either naturally in a carousel,
which is kind of automated,

1166
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,880
or in response to an action.

1167
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,490
DEREK FEATHERSTONE:
So on a carousel,

1168
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:23,840
for example, if
it autoplays, you

1169
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,220
have to be able to turn it off.

1170
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,610
And you have to be able
to start it up again.

1171
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:30,059
So I'm not sure that that's
really slowing it down

1172
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:31,350
from a performance perspective.

1173
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,183
But you should definitely
allow for somebody

1174
00:50:33,183 --> 00:50:35,740
to manually go
through the carousel

1175
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,540
if you have to have
one on your page.

1176
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,370
We also do things like if
the carousel container-- when

1177
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,500
you detect keyboard usage
within that container,

1178
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,460
we automatically
stop it from rotating

1179
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,046
so that it immediately becomes
a manual thing if you're

1180
00:50:52,046 --> 00:50:53,420
moving through it
with a keyboard

1181
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:56,440
so that you basically take
a screen reader that's

1182
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,550
on that content.

1183
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,650
If it's suddenly whisked away,
quite often what happens,

1184
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,920
if the node is just slidden--
"slidden," nice word.

1185
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,000
If the node slides
out to the side,

1186
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,680
that's different than if
the node is destroyed.

1187
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,570
And in some of these cases,
screen reader focus is lost.

1188
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,970
And they have to start over
at the top of the page.

1189
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:19,874
So that's something where
we want to kind of give them

1190
00:51:19,874 --> 00:51:21,165
a little bit more control and--

1191
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:22,865
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: I think
we're running the danger here

1192
00:51:22,865 --> 00:51:25,240
of getting into implementations
and explaining to you how

1193
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,440
to do a certain widget.

1194
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,770
And we are open to
discussion for that.

1195
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,370
It would be wonderful to ask,
get a few questions sorted.

1196
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:32,850
And then we could
answer offline.

1197
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,480
Because [INAUDIBLE] would
be like, do it like this,

1198
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,590
or do it like that.

1199
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:39,048
ALICE BOXHALL: To answer the
broader question about timing,

1200
00:51:39,048 --> 00:51:42,610
there's language in WCAG about
how long things should take,

1201
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,500
how much time you
should allow for things.

1202
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,050
So that maybe gets a bit
more at your question.

1203
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:49,680
And also, to me, it raises a
bit of a broader question, which

1204
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,130
is, I'm curious how many
web developers have even

1205
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,715
looked look at WCAG here?

1206
00:51:53,715 --> 00:51:56,330
 

1207
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:59,500
Quite a few-- cool.

1208
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,610
To me, it seems like it's
a great set of guidelines

1209
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:06,250
for creating good
user interfaces.

1210
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:10,040
So for example, things like
allowing error correction

1211
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,126
in forms-- do we
not all want that?

1212
00:52:12,126 --> 00:52:14,250
Do we not all want the form
to lose all of our data

1213
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,881
if we make a single mistake?

1214
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:19,130
So yeah, I think the web
would be better for everybody

1215
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,210
if we all followed WCAG.

1216
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,668
And this is an
example of something

1217
00:52:21,668 --> 00:52:25,146
which is in there which we could
learn about just from reading

1218
00:52:25,146 --> 00:52:25,770
the guidelines.

1219
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:26,780
And of course, there's more.

1220
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,196
There's stuff
that's not in there.

1221
00:52:28,196 --> 00:52:30,540
Or there's stuff that
needs more information.

1222
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,740
But it's a really
great place to start.

1223
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,300
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: OK, we're
running out of time here a bit.

1224
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,930
So we're skipping one of the
questions that I've ceded,

1225
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:38,790
sadly enough.

1226
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:41,460
We have one from
Aralia Moser here.

1227
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,666
 

1228
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:47,326
ARALIA MOSER: OK,
you skipped a person.

1229
00:52:47,326 --> 00:52:49,200
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: I
skipped Dan Appelquist.

1230
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,322
He can deal with it.

1231
00:52:50,322 --> 00:52:52,150
ARALIA MOSER: OK,
so I'm wondering,

1232
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,570
how do you prioritize
accessibility in your workflow?

1233
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,550
And right now, it
seems that reactive

1234
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,320
is something you need to do.

1235
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,935
So how can we make it
just the thing to do?

1236
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:02,810
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN: It's
the old question of,

1237
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,184
where's the
accessibility plug-in

1238
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:06,430
that I can put at the
end of my workflow?

1239
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,340
How do you get accessibility
into the workflow

1240
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,420
from the very beginning in
a cutthroat environment that

1241
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,460
has not much time?

1242
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,531
Derek.

1243
00:53:14,531 --> 00:53:16,530
DEREK FEATHERSTONE: It's
got to be moved earlier

1244
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,010
in the process.

1245
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:19,420
If it gets to the
end, and you're

1246
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,980
finding accessibility issues
for the first time in QA

1247
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,610
or as you're preparing
it for QA, it's too late.

1248
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,280
It has to be done
at the design level.

1249
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,840
And I think if you focus very
loosely on design, development,

1250
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,187
and QA as kind of
three important pieces,

1251
00:53:33,187 --> 00:53:35,520
not thinking about the business
side-- that's important.

1252
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,410
But the focusing
on the transition

1253
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,430
points I think is critical.

1254
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:44,430
So having designers talk with
developers and spec-ing things

1255
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,300
out-- not like as in
the spec, but here's

1256
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,950
what my intent is
with this design.

1257
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:52,830
And so a design can
specify things like,

1258
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,340
here's how the
keyboard flow should

1259
00:53:54,340 --> 00:54:00,002
work for this particular
widget, or for this page.

1260
00:54:00,002 --> 00:54:01,460
Even working on it
together, here's

1261
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,930
the most logical source order.

1262
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,534
Looking at this wire frame
and the hierarchy of content,

1263
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,450
here's the most logical
source order for that.

1264
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:11,530
And having that stuff passed
all the way down the chain

1265
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:15,930
is, to me, one of the
most critical things that

1266
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:18,690
would help address that
so that it happens earlier

1267
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:22,540
and we don't get to the
end and say, I forgot.

1268
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,700
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
Andrew, what do you think?

1269
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,660
ANDREW RONKSLEY: This is
someone else's point of view.

1270
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,380
I can't remember
who exactly it was.

1271
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:30,680
But it was talking about how
the first time you do something,

1272
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,920
it is difficult, and it
takes you longer to do it.

1273
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,085
So if you guys can remember the
first time you built a website,

1274
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:37,140
it was probably hard.

1275
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,980
And it took you a long time.

1276
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,730
The first time you
built a responsive site,

1277
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,300
your mind might have
been a bit blown

1278
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,799
like, this is taking
me a long time.

1279
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,970
But then, the next time
you do it, it's easier.

1280
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,320
The next time you do
it, again, it's easier.

1281
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,694
And then, it just
becomes normal.

1282
00:54:49,694 --> 00:54:52,230
And it's kind of like
that with accessibility.

1283
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:54,480
It only seems hard
because it's not

1284
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,060
something you'll do day to day.

1285
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,250
But if you do invest a
bit of time and effort

1286
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:02,930
into doing it a couple of times,
your workflow will change.

1287
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,224
And it just will become
something you do naturally.

1288
00:55:05,224 --> 00:55:06,890
I can't remember whose
opinion that was.

1289
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,862
But I really liked
it when I read it.

1290
00:55:08,862 --> 00:55:11,070
MATTHEW TYLEE ATKINSON: I
completely agree with that.

1291
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,110
And I completely agree
with various things

1292
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,300
that have been said
before, like for example,

1293
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,660
just try it out with a
keyboard as you're doing it.

1294
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,440
The most important thing
is, as Derek pointed out,

1295
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,634
to do it from the very start,
from the design process.

1296
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:25,050
But you're all
going to be dealing

1297
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,230
with stuff that already exists.

1298
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:31,240
And there are some
things-- I think

1299
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,620
Alice mentioned
accessibility testing.

1300
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,320
You can't do it
all mechanically.

1301
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,060
But some of it you can.

1302
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,610
And perhaps this is going
to sound odd coming from me.

1303
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:46,390
Because I'm very much reliant
on me going to look at a site

1304
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:48,520
and finding accessibility
problems with it.

1305
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,240
But there are a
whole range of things

1306
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,790
that you can test mechanically.

1307
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:55,410
For example, does every
image have an Alt attribute?

1308
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:56,840
It's a very simple thing.

1309
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,690
Now, one of my
colleagues is working on

1310
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,800
or has developed a
tool, an API in fact.

1311
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,710
It's going to be in beta soon.

1312
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:11,260
It's called [INAUDIBLE]-- which
can perform these tests that

1313
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:12,780
can be automated.

1314
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,580
And it will go away
and perform them.

1315
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,420
And because it's a
command line thing,

1316
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,640
you can make it part
of your build process.

1317
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,750
So if there were two
biggest things I would say

1318
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,990
is perhaps look at that,
see what it can do for you.

1319
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,860
Because it can be part
of your build process.

1320
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,270
A human being does not
need to waste their time

1321
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,776
on some of this stuff.

1322
00:56:29,776 --> 00:56:31,150
And the other
thing is, make sure

1323
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:35,170
that you can challenge yourself
to, like Christian said,

1324
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,910
take away the mouse
for a while and see

1325
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:39,940
if you can still use your site.

1326
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,420
Some stuff like
that you can really

1327
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,030
reduce the amount
of time and effort

1328
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:47,200
it takes by making it
part of your process.

1329
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,520
And as much as
possible, please do

1330
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,550
try and consider it
from the design stage,

1331
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:54,730
from the absolute get-go.

1332
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,700
And then, there's the
other sorts of advice

1333
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,810
that you've heard just generally
sprinkled through about testing

1334
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:03,017
things with a keyboard
and stuff like that.

1335
00:57:03,017 --> 00:57:04,850
SARAH LEWTHWAITE: I'd
like to just interject

1336
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:05,890
a little bit of sociology.

1337
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,431
Because I know that
part of the issue

1338
00:57:07,431 --> 00:57:09,920
is that it has to be a team
effort across your entire team.

1339
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,630
Some people are going to value
accessibility more than others.

1340
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,405
And I think it's trying
to position accessibility

1341
00:57:16,405 --> 00:57:19,240
as part of a norm,
which is understanding

1342
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,200
that disabled people
aren't an out group.

1343
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,920
They're part of your in group.

1344
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,760
So at the moment, there's
a term, aversive disablism.

1345
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,080
So most people believe
they're quite liberal.

1346
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,630
They don't discriminate
against disabled people.

1347
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,672
But if you're designing
for your group,

1348
00:57:35,672 --> 00:57:37,630
and that group doesn't
include disabled people,

1349
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,419
then you might as well be
making disablist judgments.

1350
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:41,710
Because you're still excluding.

1351
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,001
The outputs are still the same.

1352
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:46,450
So in that sense, it's
important to sort of expand

1353
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,850
the concept of who
a normal user is

1354
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:53,669
to include disabled
people of who we know.

1355
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:55,460
CHRISTIAN HEILMANN:
OK, we have to wrap up.

1356
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,040
So I have to thank the panel.

1357
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,950
And I am incredibly excited
about all of your interest.

1358
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,605
Because having worked
in accessibility

1359
00:58:01,605 --> 00:58:03,230
and having to shout
at people for years

1360
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,342
to consider
accessibility, it's great

1361
00:58:05,342 --> 00:58:06,550
that there's a new way there.

1362
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,720
It's kind of
disheartening that we

1363
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,366
have to remind people
about something.

1364
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:10,740
There seems to be
a communication

1365
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:14,820
gap between the accessibility
evangelists and the developers

1366
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,440
out there.

1367
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,009
And a lot of things
can be repeated

1368
00:58:17,009 --> 00:58:18,300
and have been said a few times.

1369
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,910
So I'm really happy about this.

1370
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:23,140
So take this idea, take this
enthusiasm about it out there,

1371
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,780
and pester as many
people as possible

1372
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,730
who know about accessibility.

1373
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:30,700
And if you get grumpy
answers, as Patrick said,

1374
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,780
we're just people, too.

1375
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,010
So that just happens.

1376
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,090
So thanks very much again,
and thanks everyone.

1377
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:41,699
[APPLAUSE]
