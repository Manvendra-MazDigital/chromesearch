00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,160
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to Google
Developers Weekly for

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,330
September 4, 2013, our highlight
reel of what's

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,210
happening in the world
of Google Developers

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,830
on the set and off.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,250
Before the Labor Day holiday
here in the United States, we

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,230
had a big week in our studios.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,090
So let's shake those cobwebs off
of our three-day weekend,

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,280
get back to work, and go
to those highlights.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,820
It's one thing to know how to
code, but it's quite another

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,760
to take that leap and start your
own company based on one

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,620
of your many brilliant ideas.

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,100
Our good friends Martin Omander
and Don Dodge helped

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,160
us out with a pair of shows from
root access, covering how

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,550
startups can incorporate
and get funded.

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,340
So you can go from having a
great idea to affording to eat

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,010
in between all those
all-nighters.

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,930
Once you've started that company
and are building that

19
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,640
incredible app, you want to make
sure it looks good and

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,320
feels just right.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,750
That's why we brought in our
Dev UX team, led by Nazmul,

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,620
and they spoke to us on how to
be thinking about great design

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,490
when creating new
applications.

24
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,010
This week, they also showed us
how to invite the world to

25
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,630
your application through adding
social integration

26
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,690
through many social networks.

27
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,190
Also, as I said last week,
the best shows

28
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,590
are made into trilogies.

29
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,130
I was lucky to have Chicago's
own Brian Fitzpatrick in

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,870
Mountain View for three
high-quality events to help

31
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,620
you take control of your career
and of your data.

32
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,140
We started with everybody's
favorite, organizational

33
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,210
manipulation.

34
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,740
We joined the data liberation
front, and we wrapped with a

35
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,750
deep dive into Google's
transparency report.

36
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,510
Fitz Week might be over, but
the memories live on in

37
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,960
YouTube, and on the Google
Developers Live website.

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,550
Here at GDL, when we're not
watching YouTube, you might

39
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,380
find us catching up on the
day's news with CNN.

40
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,290
Resident Glass guy Timothy
Jordan hosted Jeff Eddings of

41
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,320
CNN to talk about the
network's Glass app.

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,930
Timothy also taught the rest
of us about some cool new

43
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,420
options for commanding Glass
with your voice, including

44
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,800
integrations with social network
path and Evernote.

45
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,505
OK, Glass.

46
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:03,860
Send my information to path.

47
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,655
Well beyond our Mountain View
campus, from Tel Aviv, Ido

48
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:10,539
Green taught us how to debug
Node.js applications using

49
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,040
Chrome dev tools.

50
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,015
Alberto Rossi in Milan showed
us how to build Android apps

51
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:17,140
with HTML5 and JavaScript.

52
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,280
And from Buenos Aires,
[INAUDIBLE]

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,110
presented on Google+ Sign In.

54
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,040
Live from New York, it was the
App Script team, taking your

55
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,680
questions in another edition
of Google Apps Unscripted,

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,710
while Ibraham Ulukaya partnered
up with Roman Nurik

57
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,195
to tackle best practices from
the YouTube APIs on Android

58
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:38,030
and Android design.

59
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,230
Our users and developers span
the globe, so our studios and

60
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,360
engineers do, too.

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,850
Away from our Google Developers
Live studios, the

62
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,910
GDGx team of talented engineers
has produced a new

63
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,800
Google Developer Groups app
for Android devices.

64
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,740
This app provides direct access
to your favorite GDL

65
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,540
shows, along with news and
information about your local

66
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,310
GDG, and even achievements
that you can unlock.

67
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,520
That's not just GDGx,
that's GDG extreme.

68
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,440
Promises have come to Chrome.

69
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,530
In the HTML document object
model, a promise provides

70
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,180
asynchronous access to the
result of an operation,

71
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,710
whether it already took
place or not.

72
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,260
Francois Beaufort posted about
how promises come true in

73
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,120
Chrome 30 beta.

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,972
We've come a long way.

75
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:26,470
And Android developers, Android
Studio marches on.

76
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,530
The team has released version
0.2.6 with various bug fixes

77
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,760
to smooth your work.

78
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,360
Be sure to update your Android
studio to take advantage of

79
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,480
the latest.

80
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,290
And to make sure you take
advantage of the latest and

81
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,780
never miss a thing from the
world of Google Developers,

82
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,350
subscribe to Google Developers
on YouTube and check out the

83
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,860
GDL schedule at

84
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,220
I'm Louis Gray, and I'll
see you in the studio.

85
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:55,520
