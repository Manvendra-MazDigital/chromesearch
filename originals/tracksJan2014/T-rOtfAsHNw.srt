00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,550

00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,090
SCOTT ROWE: CSS properties are
some of the most ubiquitous

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,200
artifacts in web development.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,540
You can't really develop
anything for the web without

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,000
editing its CSS properties.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,690
There are some 500 CSS
properties, though the most

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,700
commonly used of these narrow
down to a few hundred.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,160
And it is these most commonly
used properties that we aim to

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,160
document for the beta release
of Web Platform Docs.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,280
And we're excited to have
third parties like Adobe

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,370
Brackets and Chrome Dev Tools
using this information in

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,580
their products.

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,080
This video serves to supplement
the information

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,250
you'll find on the CSS property
project pages.

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,520
In other words, yes, you'll
still need to read the Web

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,620
Platform Wednesday Doc and the
CSS Property Editing Guide to

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,870
be prepared to contribute
to this project.

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,580
Once you're ready to start,
visit the Web Platform

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,630
Wednesday page to choose
some properties and

20
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,840
tasks to work on.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,560
Every Wednesday at 11 o'clock AM
Pacific time, seven o'clock

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,760
PM UTC, we gather on the free
node IRC channel #webplatform

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,200
to go over the list
of properties

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,720
designated for the week.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
You can either post to the
channel with the properties

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,050
and tasks you want to work on,
or you can send an email to

27
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,300
public-webplatform @w3.org.

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,390

29
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,050
You'll be contacted by a
coordinator who will help you

30
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,460
work on the project.

31
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,470
But you don't have
to wait until

32
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,830
Wednesday to get involved.

33
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,000
Send an email any time.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,680
Wherever possible, choose a
group of related properties,

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,720
so you can take advantage of any
cut and paste shortcuts.

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,940
For example, Rob Simpson has
signed up to work on several

37
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,640
text decoration properties.

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,340
He sent an email to
public-webplatform@w3.org, and

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,160
coordinator Julie edited the
table to sign him up.

40
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,830
You won't need to
edit this table.

41
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,630
Just stay in contact with the
coordinator as you work, and

42
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,010
the coordinator will update
all the record keeping.

43
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,190
Often you'll have a group of
related properties that

44
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,560
includes a shorthand property.

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,479
Think of the shorthand property
as the master

46
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,690
property of the group.

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,200
For example, the text decoration
property is the

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,980
shorthand property for the text
decoration color, text

49
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,060
decoration line, and text
decoration style CSS

50
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,100
properties.

51
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,260
Once the coordinator has
signed you up for the

52
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,860
property, click on the link
in the table and open the

53
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,010
Properties page.

54
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,220
If the link is red or the page
does not exist, contact the

55
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,310
coordinator.

56
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,160
If your group of articles
includes a shorthand property,

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,590
work on the page for the
shorthand property first.

58
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,490
You'll need to refer to
the w3 specifications.

59
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,810
Pull up the specs cited in the
fourth column of the table,

60
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,596
then search the page for the
property you were working on.

61
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:48,920
Ah, they moved it to
a different spec.

62
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,810
This sort of thing happens
a lot with specs.

63
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,910
They're constantly changing.

64
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,400
Also be sure you're referring
to the most up to date spec.

65
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,780
At the top of the specification
page, there are

66
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,870
listed all of the pertinent
versions.

67
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,420
Use the latest editor's
draft spec.

68
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,020
In page search is your
best friend.

69
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,010
Notice that the shorthand
property is described after

70
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,390
its component properties.

71
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,440
This is typical.

72
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,350
Note also that the specs contain
a lot of superfluous

73
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,580
information.

74
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,180
This is because they are
intended primarily for browser

75
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,430
developers who are implementing
the standard, not

76
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,780
necessarily for application
developers and designers using

77
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,620
the standard.

78
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,410
Your job is to distill from all
of this information just

79
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,620
what a developer or designer
needs to use the property in

80
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,850
an application.

81
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,850
We'll go over how to include
this information in your dock

82
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,830
a little bit later
in the video.

83
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,340
However, not all the information
about the property

84
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,050
may be found in the spec.

85
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,240
Review other documentation
sources for more information

86
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,840
and to get familiar
with the property.

87
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,320
As you find information in other
sources, be careful to

88
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,640
use it only in a manner that
does not violate any

89
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,950
copyrights or license
restrictions.

90
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,260
Don't plagiarize.

91
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,440
In Web Platform Docs, we
always provide content

92
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,300
attribution when information
is drawn

93
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,870
from external sources.

94
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,200
See the Editor's Guide for more
information about license

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,440
and copyright issues and
external attribution.

96
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,010
We'll go over external
attribution in greater detail

97
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,750
later in this video.

98
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,400
While CSS properties are the
focus of Web Platform

99
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,490
Wednesdays, you can sign up to
work on specific tasks for CSS

100
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,580
property pages, or you can sign
up for all tasks on a

101
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,610
given page.

102
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,720
The tasks are documenting basic
facts, explanatory text,

103
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,580
creating examples, links, and
reviewing complete articles.

104
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,810
The basic facts include the
values in the overview table,

105
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,620
the syntax, and the
property values.

106
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,250
You can copy and paste these
values and descriptions from

107
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,500
the specs as they are.

108
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,240

109
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,490
The spec says for the animatable
value, see

110
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,330
individual properties.

111
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,560
Usually if all of the longhand
properties are animatable, the

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,620
associated shorthand property
is animatable too.

113
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,870
You should always test it.

114
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,830

115
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,720
Ask the coordinator if you need
help testing properties

116
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,970
for animation.

117
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,250

118
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,540
For the CSS object model
property, this is usually the

119
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,940
same name as the property with
the hyphens removed and the

120
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,390
words combined with camelCase,
as shown here.

121
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,920
By the way, you can ignore
the percentages field.

122
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,990

123
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,350
Notice that the border style
value none has a link to more

124
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,100
information about background
image here in the W3C spec.

125
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,140

126
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,340
Be sure to pull all that
information into your

127
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,670
documentation.

128
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,310
In this example, that the image
layer counts, but is not

129
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,840
drawn when the value is none,
and include a link to the

130
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,190
related WPD page, in this
example, the background image

131
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,970
CSS property page.

132
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,350
In other words, be sure to
include all relevant

133
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,455
supplementary information in
the value descriptions.

134
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:12,190

135
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,130
Notice also that we use code
formatting to style the text

136
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,620
for other property
values described.

137
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,110
In the hidden property value
description, the words none

138
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,700
and hidden are formatted as
code to set them off from

139
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,910
ordinary text.

140
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,860
Once you have all the values
documented, the syntax section

141
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,935
displays them as code syntax
automatically.

142
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:36,050

143
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,880
The explanatory text in the
summary, usage, and note

144
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,630
sections is where you
will contribute to

145
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,830
your original content.

146
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,450
You will contribute your
original content gleaned from

147
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,090
your research in the specs and
related documentation.

148
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,950
Here, it is really important
that you contribute only

149
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,950
original content.

150
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,145
No cutting and pasting verbatim
from other sources.

151
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:57,810

152
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,710
The article summary should
briefly describe the property.

153
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,490
If the property is a shorthand
property, the summary should

154
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,630
say so and link to all of the
properties associated with the

155
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,880
shorthand property.

156
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,030

157
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,060
The usage section provides
guidelines for using the

158
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,000
property and any little gotchas
not obvious in the

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,290
descriptions.

160
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,040
Notes describe considerations
for how the property works,

161
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,750
usually beyond the
user's control.

162
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,090
Don't worry about the important
notes section.

163
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,660
This is just an artifact from
the initial content import.

164
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,170

165
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,270
Now for the funnest part,
the examples.

166
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,670
Keep these super simple.

167
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,790
Save the complex, fancy examples
for a tutorial

168
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,510
another day.

169
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,140
Your example should demonstrate

170
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,490
this property only.

171
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,140
Don't introduce other properties
or make the example

172
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,880
dependent upon the knowledge
of other properties.

173
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,210
Also, the example should
be self explanatory.

174
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,970
To create an example, start
with a new codelet at

175
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,220
code.webplatform.org.

176
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,300

177
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,630
First, I save as new to
create a new codelet.

178
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,250
This will assign a file
name to the codelet.

179
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,940
Then I replace the dummy
content with my own.

180
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,200
You should test your example in
all of the major browsers.

181
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,000
Watch out for deviations
from the spec

182
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,360
when you run the example.

183
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,500
It turns out that dotted lines
in Chrome are composed of

184
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,970
square dots instead of round
ones, as they are in Firefox.

185
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,950
I'll go back and adjust the
description accordingly.

186
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,280
We want to catch and document
these little deviances and

187
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,990
details wherever we find them.

188
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,950
In this example, I've
set up an element to

189
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,890
demonstrate each value.

190
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,230
However, you can also set up
your examples to be more

191
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,669
interactive.

192
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,840
In this example, the values for
the property are provided

193
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,960
in the comments, so a
user can just plug

194
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,920
them in and play around.

195
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,860
But that's about as complicated
as you should make

196
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,560
your example.

197
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,630
Don't get carried away with
creating drop-down menus for

198
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,590
all the values, or otherwise
building a playground up here.

199
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,750
That will only clutter the code
and distract the user.

200
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,200
Once you have a nice working
example, copy the pertinent

201
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,140
code back into the page
for the property you

202
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,260
were working on.

203
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,350
Notice I'm only including the
CSS code, not the HTML, here

204
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,800
in the CSS property
documentation.

205
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,460

206
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,800
Also, copy the URL from the
codelet example to the live

207
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,670
example URL field, which will be
the value for the View Live

208
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,220
Example link in the
published doc.

209
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,460

210
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,300
To create a link to the W3C
specification, under related

211
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,502
specifications, copy and paste
the title of the specification

212
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:36,690
into the name field, the URL
for the spec into the URL

213
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,220
field, and the status level
into the status field.

214
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,680

215
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,740
Some properties belong to more
than one specification, so be

216
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,580
sure to include references
to each specification.

217
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,600
You can skip the compatibility
sections.

218
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,020
We're replacing these
with automated data.

219
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,480
In the see also section,
skip topic clusters.

220
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,380
These two are getting
an overhaul.

221
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,550
In the manual links field,
include cross references to

222
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,480
related CSS properties and other
internal resources, such

223
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,180
as tutorials from the
CSS tutorials page.

224
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,040
In the external links field,
include any references to

225
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,170
relevant external content.

226
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,520
In the topic section, check
the box for CSS.

227
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,330
Don't check any other boxes.

228
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,590
In the external attribution
section, leave any checked

229
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,100
boxes the way they are.

230
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,580
And if any of the content you
contributed came from an

231
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,610
external source, check the box
for that source and include

232
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,340
the link to the source
in the link field.

233
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,780

234
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,660
That's it for the
edits for now.

235
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,070
Remember, you can always come
back later and edit some more

236
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,930
in case you remember something
you've forgotten.

237
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,230
If you are not the reviewer, be
sure the needs review check

238
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,440
box in the high level issue
section is checked.

239
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,320
If you are the reviewer, make
any corrections or additions

240
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,970
to the content as needed.

241
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,250
Once your review is complete,
uncheck the needs

242
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,340
review check box.

243
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,620
If any other high level issues
check boxes are checked,

244
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,040
please resolve the issue and
uncheck the box or note the

245
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,370
issue for your report back to
the coordinator for Web

246
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,480
Platform Wednesdays.

247
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,850
When you're all done editing
a page, under edit details,

248
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,760
enter a summary of the
work you've performed

249
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,780
and click save page.

250
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,000
If you're working on CSS
properties as part of Web

251
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,470
Platform Wednesday, be sure to
note how much time you spent

252
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,260
on any particular property and
report that back to the

253
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,340
coordinator.

254
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,910
Also note any issues or concerns
you have with the

255
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,400
content and report that
back as well.

256
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:45,580
Also please, please, please
tweet, post, or otherwise

257
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,400
communicate through social media
channels like Facebook

258
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,910
and G+ and Twitter.

259
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,800
We want to get the word out.

260
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,300
And that completes
the exercise.

261
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,830
Thanks for contributing.

262
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,930
Your time and expertise
are invaluable.

263
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,440
And your contribution to Web
Platform Docs and the greater

264
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,650
community is making the
web successful.

265
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:12,078
