1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
PAUL IRISH: I want to take
a few minutes of your time

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,380
to tell you about
some of the new things

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,100
that we're doing in the Chrome
DevTools specifically focused

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,680
on mobile.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,320
But to do that, I
really want to take back

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,800
the clock like two years,
back before remote debugging.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,600
Two years ago,
development for mobile

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,330
was something along
the lines of, OK.

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,454
Let's do it on desktop.

10
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,870
And then I'll come over, and
I'll kind of drag the window.

11
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,150
Yeah.

12
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,650
OK.

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,330
And then I'll pick up my device
and I'll type it in there.

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:27,921
OK.

15
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:28,920
I need to make a change.

16
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,270
I'll come back here.

17
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,490
And that, it's a very
slow iteration cycle,

18
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,690
and that just slows
you down and makes

19
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,850
it much harder to create
compelling content.

20
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,810
So we've been
thinking about this,

21
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,351
and we want to make
that much better.

22
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:42,480
We want those iteration
cycles to be really fast.

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,710
We want it to be as easy
to debug and develop

24
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,450
for mobile as it is on desktop.

25
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,930
And so I'm going to talk
about three things today.

26
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,315
First up, remote debugging.

27
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:56,180
We'll talk about the browser on
the device, the real experience

28
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,870
over there, and then
talk about bringing

29
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,369
some of those mobile
characteristics

30
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,860
onto the desktop,
and then bringing it

31
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,319
all into a development workflow
and making it fast and fluid.

32
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,190
So first up, remote debugging.

33
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,827

34
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:11,160
So I've got my phone right here.

35
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,590
And I want to remote debug it.

36
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,570
So what I'm going to do
is come up to the top

37
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,580
here, click on Chrome's Hot Dog
Menu, that's the official name.

38
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,760
And we'll go down to Tools, and
then down at the bottom down

39
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,220
here is Inspect Devices.

40
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,170
So that's what
we're going to do.

41
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,020
Now you see here that there's
a check box on Discover USB

42
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,910
Devices.

43
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,440
This is because the discovery
and communication for devices

44
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,250
to remote debug is now
inside Chrome completely.

45
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,480
You used to have to
download the Android SDK,

46
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,280
get the 80 to binary or
get a Chrome extension.

47
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,480
Forget all that.

48
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,150
You just plug in the device.

49
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:54,210
So I'll plug in mine now,
and [POPPING NOISES].

50
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:54,710
All right.

51
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,420
Cool.

52
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,190
It looks like on my phone I
have two different Chromes.

53
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,580
We have Chrome 32, Chrome 31.

54
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,790
I have two tabs open here.

55
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,090
I can do an inspection.

56
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,800
I can change which
tab is my active tab.

57
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Reload and close.

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,091
I have a little bit of control.

59
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,770
And I want to actually
just open up a new tab.

60
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,060
So I'm going to just type
in a new URL right here,

61
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,685
and I'm going to go
to news.google.com.

62
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,860

63
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,360
OK.

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,690
So it opened up on my device,
and you can see it here.

65
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,620
And I have the DevTools.

66
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,120
Cool.

67
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,730
So I'm just going to-- this
is the actual DevTools.

68
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,340
It's working.

69
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,030
It's cool.

70
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,190
It's awesome.

71
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,450
And when I highlight you
can see-- can you see?

72
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:38,950
OK.

73
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,500
Probably not.

74
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,580
But I'd love to be
able to show you this.

75
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,860
And in fact, when we think
about remote debugging,

76
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,770
it's a lot of-- I
have my DevTools here

77
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,010
and my device down
here, and it's

78
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,940
a lot of switching
back and forth.

79
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,770
And we thought that there's
probably a better way

80
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,180
to bring what you're
looking at down here

81
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,670
and have it visible on the
screen where your tools are.

82
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,320
So we have right here
this little icon.

83
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,630
And this is a new feature
that we're unveiling today,

84
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,000
and it's called Screencast.

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,271
And we're able to bring the
screen onto the device right

86
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:10,770
here.

87
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:17,010
[APPLAUSE]

88
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,610
PAUL IRISH: So this
is a really cool.

89
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,110
All right.

90
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,880
So let's interact
with this page.

91
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,720
Let's search.

92
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,220
OK.

93
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,636
I'm going to just
click in Search,

94
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:27,466
and I'm going to
type Google Chrome.

95
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:28,140
You know what?

96
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,490
Typing with my thumbs
is really slow.

97
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,030
Keyboards are way faster.

98
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,570
Let's just switch
over to my keyword

99
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,360
here and finish this off.

100
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,860
Nice.

101
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,724
[APPLAUSE]

102
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:39,640
PAUL IRISH: All right.

103
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,050
So I can type.

104
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,640
I can click.

105
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,340
I can scroll.

106
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,270
I can scroll on my trackpad.

107
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,860
No problem.

108
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,060
I'm going to go over
to Images and do

109
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,490
my real favorite
feature, inspect element.

110
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,032
It works the way you want it to.

111
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,240
Just pick it with your mouse.

112
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,660
It works flawlessly.

113
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,240
Really nice.

114
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,980
So this is really cool stuff.

115
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,080
I also have full control here
of the back forward reload.

116
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,250
And I'm actually just going
to go to a different site.

117
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:10,750
Let's see.

118
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,290
I'm going to come back
here, focus this other tab,

119
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,680
and we'll bring that up.

120
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,731
So this is a cool site.

121
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:19,980
You might have seen it before.

122
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,650
It's a Beer Camp kind
of advertisement.

123
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,002
I'm going to go landscape to
make this a little bit better.

124
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:27,710
And one of the things
that I want to show

125
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,500
is that this is a
really cool site where

126
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,130
they have this flip-book effect.

127
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,440
The guys at nclud did
a great job on this.

128
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,790
But I imagine that it
was very hard to develop,

129
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,290
because what they're doing is
they're manipulating these CSS

130
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,210
3D transforms in 3D space and
kind of changing all this.

131
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,290
I want to show a new kind
of experimental feature

132
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,820
that we're still working on.

133
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,090
It's the Layers Panel.

134
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,690
So here now I'm able to identify
in 3D space what this is like.

135
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,840
So I get a live preview
of these layers.

136
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,536
You heard [? Tommy ?] talking
yesterday about layers,

137
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,910
and now I'm able
to see what they

138
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,650
look like in a 3D
representation.

139
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,590
Nice.

140
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,370
Yeah.

141
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,070
You like it?

142
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,450

143
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:14,950
[APPLAUSE]

144
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,491
PAUL IRISH: Now they
said to look out

145
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:18,640
for the extra information,
and it tells you

146
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,290
quite a bit of stuff.

147
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,280
So right now we're
showing the position,

148
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,720
the size, why it was
composited, which is often

149
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,480
a really key piece
of information.

150
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,360
Also an estimate
on how much memory

151
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,970
it has, how many
paints have gone in.

152
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,386
So we're getting
a lot of insight,

153
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:35,050
especially into
something like the GPU

154
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,330
behavior on a device,
which thus far has

155
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,800
been kind of a black box.

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,760
All right.

157
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,280
So we come out of this.

158
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,960
So for USB debugging,
just plug it in.

159
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,390
Don't worry about ADB.

160
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,090
Don't worry about
Chrome extensions.

161
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,974
You're good.

162
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,140
The feature set that's
available on remote debugging

163
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,740
is the same very
powerful feature

164
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,185
set they use, too, on
desktop, all that stuff.

165
00:05:56,185 --> 00:05:58,840
Timeline, memory, debugging,
all of it's there.

166
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,480
You can Screencast your
screen, interact with it,

167
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,750
inspect, type, click.

168
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,400
The clicks are
translated to touches.

169
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,664
It's exactly what
you would expect.

170
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:09,330
And port forwarding
is one more, but I'm

171
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,400
going to show that
a little bit later.

172
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,860
I wanted to ask, though-- OK.

173
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,455
So raise your hands if you
test your stuff on two devices.

174
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:18,320
Two devices.

175
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,540
Keep your hands raised if you
test yourself on 10 devices.

176
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,630
That's kind of a lot.

177
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,280
I understand.

178
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,072
But I imagine that for
everyone-- and congratulations

179
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:28,280
for all you 10 device people.

180
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,130
You guys are heroes.

181
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,080
That is serious work.

182
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,680
But I imagine that
everyone that-- there

183
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,190
are more than 10 devices
that come to your site.

184
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,370
Right?

185
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,710
It's hard for us to
evaluate compatibility

186
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,460
with all of those.

187
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,379
So remote debugging is very
powerful for understanding

188
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,670
performance characteristics,
network conditions, things

189
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,170
like that.

190
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,800
But we can't do that for
every possible device

191
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,690
that we need to check
compatibility against.

192
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,860
So on Chrome DevTools
we've thought about this

193
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,390
and thought about
what we can do.

194
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,580
And so today I'm going to
show a new feature called

195
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,540
Mobile Emulation.

196
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,980
So this is some cool stuff,
and let me just show it to you.

197
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,480
I'm going to come
over here, and I'm

198
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:13,120
going to open up Wikipedia,
the article for the emulator.

199
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,550
And I'm interested in
doing some mobile--

200
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,730
I want to change how this is
represented on mobile devices

201
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,720
And so I'm just going to try
changing the screen size.

202
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,070
OK.

203
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,090
Unfortunately, this is not your
responsive kind of experience

204
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,654
that you want.

205
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:33,690
All right.

206
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,560
Let's open up DevTools.

207
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,700
Now down on the
bottom is a drawer.

208
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,660
You can access it
with this icon,

209
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,360
or you can just hit
escape to do that.

210
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,610
And you might be used to
seeing the console down here,

211
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,590
but there's a new
tab called Emulation.

212
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,040
Inside Emulation
there's a lot of stuff.

213
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,730
There's characteristics
for the screen resolution,

214
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,160
the devicePixelRatio,
autosizing, viewport,

215
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,112
user agent, Geolocation.

216
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:00,820
Good, good stuff.

217
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,819
There's a lot of things.

218
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:06,260
And so there's a few
device presets in here

219
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,500
that'll help set
all these at once.

220
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,180
So I'm actually just going
to choose this Nexus 4 here.

221
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,966
And it has a few viewport
settings of its own,

222
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:17,590
a devicePixelRatio
of 2 , a user agent,

223
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,250
and I'm just going
to turn on Emulation.

224
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,780
Now Wikipedia serves different
markup to mobile devices,

225
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,290
so I just need to
do a refresh first.

226
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,950
But yeah.

227
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,650
This is a little bit more
like what I'm expecting.

228
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,929
So a standard user
agent [INAUDIBLE]

229
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,030
would probably be able to
at least get the mark up

230
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,409
in CSS for this.

231
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,890
But we're doing a lot
more than just them.

232
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,700
First up, I can
scroll, and you can

233
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,810
see as I scroll the
contents for the pages,

234
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,620
I see it sliding
out of the viewport.

235
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,560
My cursor is changed
to this to indicate

236
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,410
that it is now a touch cursor.

237
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,570
And in fact, as I touch,
touch events are firing.

238
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,920
I can hold down Shift and
actually do a pinch, too.

239
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,810
So I can zoom just like you
would do with your fingers.

240
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,580
And this is the
exact same viewport

241
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,410
zooming that you
would see on a phone.

242
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,410

243
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,560
We put a lot of effort
into making sure

244
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,450
that the view here that
you see is as close as you

245
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,590
would see on a real device.

246
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,359
And so I'm going to try
to bring this over here

247
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:25,400
and just remote debug it.

248
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,130
I'll bring it up on my phone,
since I have one of these.

249
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,630
Screencast.

250
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,690
Hello.

251
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,650
And we'll come back to this.

252
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,220
And we're looking pretty good.

253
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,860
So there's a lot going in here.

254
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,960
And one of the things
that I want to point out

255
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,400
is that there are,
in some cases--

256
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,370
so you can see we're
enabling text autosizing

257
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,630
and also Android font metrics.

258
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,100
These font metrics are
something us developers are not

259
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,570
normally exposed to.

260
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,090
It turns out that
on Android WebKit--

261
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,300
and devices can actually
set a little fudge factor

262
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,630
to change the size of
how fonts are rendered.

263
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,240
This is never exposed to
us in CSS or JavaScript

264
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,620
or anything else like that,
but devices have this.

265
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,730
It mostly affects
sites that do not

266
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,485
have a meta viewport applied,
so kind of desktop sites

267
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:16,820
that are viewed.

268
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,420
But luckily, inside
Blink and WebKit,

269
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,960
we kind of know
what all these are.

270
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,900
So we just baked them
into the emulation

271
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,070
to make sure that the text that
you see inside Emulation mode

272
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,720
is as close as
possible as to what

273
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,790
you would see on
the actual device.

274
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,420
All right.

275
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,500
I'm going to come back here.

276
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,160
And I want to talk about
another feature that's in there.

277
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,820
It's devicePixelRatio.

278
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:46,350
So my MacBook Air is
not a retina machine.

279
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,500
It has a devicePixelRatio of 1.

280
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,140
In fact, we can see that here.

281
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,030
This page is just a
really basic demo.

282
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,710
It uses image set, and we
choose the kind of asset

283
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,460
based on the devicePixelRatio
of the device.

284
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,670
And so when I view
it on my machine,

285
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,630
it's just the 1x image
that's coming in.

286
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,530
I'm going to open up DevTools
and turn on the Emulation,

287
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,460
and we're seeing 2x.

288
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:16,830
So the devicePixelRatio
emulation captures all of this.

289
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,010
In fact, things
like image set act

290
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,460
exactly the way
you would expect.

291
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,700
Window.devicePixelRatio, any
devicePixelRatio meta queries,

292
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,190
all of that code that
everything goes through

293
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,970
on mobile browsers,
it's now going

294
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,900
through all of that
in the emulation

295
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,720
feature inside the
Chrome DevTools.

296
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,450
I took a look at a
few more other sites.

297
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,850
This is me with the Nexus S
emulating "The Boston Globe."

298
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,700
And I have an old Nexus S,
so I just brought that up,

299
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,430
looking pretty
sharp side by side.

300
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:56,030
And then I went flower shopping
for my mom for Thanksgiving.

301
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,130
Again, we're looking
very close now.

302
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,010
So that's the thing,
is that we really

303
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,370
think that having the
ability to emulate many

304
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,980
of the characteristics
of these mobile devices

305
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,010
saves you a lot of time.

306
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,340
And so you don't always have to
go down to your actual devices.

307
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,650
One more thing, this is kind
of an interesting situation.

308
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:20,830
This is the Chromium bug
tracker, as you can see.

309
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,200
And when I resize, it
just kind of sticks there.

310
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,510
But interestingly, you spend
a lot of time in your browser,

311
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,290
and you've experienced
desktop pages, especially

312
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,710
with fixed positioning.

313
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,670
And you zoom in.

314
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,190
I'm just doing a shift
pinch right here.

315
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,550
You'll notice this kind
of a thing happens.

316
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,340
This is a behavior that you
cannot really emulate normally

317
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,660
just by resizing the window.

318
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,390
And because we have
viewport emulation inside

319
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,630
of this feature, we can
really mimic the behavior

320
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,440
that you get on a phone.

321
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,010
So mobile emulation captures
your standard screen

322
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,850
resolution, the
devicePixelRatio, the text

323
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,745
autosizing behavior.

324
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:08,710
It happens mostly with
pages that they do not

325
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,785
have a meta viewport set.

326
00:13:10,785 --> 00:13:13,870
The viewports, though,
this the viewport width

327
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,710
equals device width,
or you're setting up

328
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,789
something else, all of
that is now baked in here.

329
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:20,330
That's something that we haven't
been able to do on a desktop

330
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,874
before.

331
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:23,290
Touch events, of
course, including

332
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,850
synthetic gestures like
pinch, zoom, and pan,

333
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,530
and then your standard
user agent string, device,

334
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,850
geolocation, orientation
and that stuff.

335
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm going to show one more here.

336
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,530
This is forecast.io.

337
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,080
Many people have probably
seen this site before.

338
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,860
Really nice,
well-developed site.

339
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:48,580
But it doesn't really-- my
standard approach would not

340
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,410
probably work here.

341
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,335
And even clicking
these menus and map,

342
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:54,460
it looks like they're only
bound with touch events.

343
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,330
So it's a little bit challenging
to approach this completely

344
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,620
on desktop.

345
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,905
So I'm going to go into
DevTools, turn on Emulation,

346
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:04,280
and just give it
a quick refresh.

347
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,820

348
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,800
And this is looking a lot
more like what I would expect.

349
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,300
I can swipe this out.

350
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,640
I can go into the menu.

351
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,800
Even go into the map,
and my touch move events

352
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,520
are behaving just
like I would expect.

353
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,260

354
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,010
All right.

355
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,750
So mobile emulation, it
can do a lot of things.

356
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,020
Emulate the rendering and
mobile characteristics

357
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,140
that you would get
on many devices

358
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,060
and have it right
here on desktop.

359
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,180
You can also see
what a retina would

360
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,790
look like on a
non-retina machine

361
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,610
and the vice versa,
and identify if you

362
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,180
have different assets coming
in for different pixel ratios.

363
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,730
Emulate that all right here.

364
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,230
All right.

365
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,120
Lastly, iterating quickly,
especially on mobile.

366
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,332
And to do this, I'm
going to launch a demo

367
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:57,040
and show a feature
called the Workspaces.

368
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,390
This is something that
we launched at Google I/O

369
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,710
earlier this year.

370
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,640
So I have a site coming up.

371
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,140
OK.

372
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,640
Cool.

373
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,280
HTML5 Please is the site.

374
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,870
But you can see I'm hosting
it off of a local host.

375
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:16,040
But I really want to do some
development on my phone.

376
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,160
So I can take this over and
go over to about inspect

377
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,665
and open up my tab.

378
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:24,220

379
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,040
And it's not-- come on.

380
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,730
Oh.

381
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,490
Oh.

382
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,720
Right.

383
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,430
Local host 8000 on the
phone is the phone.

384
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,470
And the phone doesn't
have a web server on it.

385
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,300
So right.

386
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,870
OK.

387
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,210
Cool.

388
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,110
We'll come back here.

389
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,258
Yes.

390
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:45,758
Yes.

391
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:46,450
Yes.

392
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,201
Port forwarding.

393
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:47,700
OK.

394
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,500
Cool.

395
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,460
So let's forward the port.

396
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,470
So right here we're going to
forward my machine's local host

397
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,460
8000, send it over to
the device on its 8000.

398
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,260
We'll turn that guy on.

399
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,230
Done.

400
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,090
His green lights light up and
say, you're all good to go,

401
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,430
and let's try this again.

402
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,490
Refresh.

403
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:07,990
Nice.

404
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,489
All right.

405
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:12,534
[APPLAUSE]

406
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:13,450
PAUL IRISH: All right.

407
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:13,950
Cool.

408
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,000
So I have my local project, and
I want to make some changes.

409
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,480
I'm just going to inspect
element on my phone.

410
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,530
And we're going
to come down here.

411
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,622
And it looks like,
actually, these styles

412
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:29,080
are coming in from
Sass right here.

413
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,790

414
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,980
And with Sass we have
source map support.

415
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
So actually if I just
hold down Command,

416
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,130
I can click on this
property, and we'll

417
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,360
go to the original location
in the authored source

418
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,220
where that background
was defined.

419
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,330
So it's actually in a mixin.

420
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,860
The color looks like it's
coming in as a variable.

421
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,680
Let's jump out and Command
click on the color this time.

422
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,180
OK.

423
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,800
Cool.

424
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,550
Cool.

425
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,750
This is the variable file.

426
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,620
And the color is
defined right down here.

427
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,060
And I want to change
it a little bit,

428
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,670
so let's lighten
it up just a touch.

429
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,200
I'll type "lighten,"
and we'll go for 20%.

430
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,240
And I'll just hit Save.

431
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,270
Nice.

432
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,810
Cool.

433
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,660
What do you think?

434
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,190
50%?

435
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,819
A little bit more?

436
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,560
Or we could darken it back up.

437
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,750

438
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,250
Yeah.

439
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:30,760
That's good.

440
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,680
Nice.

441
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,760
So what we're doing here
is that I'm typing Sass.

442
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,620
I'm hitting save
inside the DevTools,

443
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,890
because I just navigated
right over from style pane

444
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,120
to my original author code.

445
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,550
I'm hitting Save.

446
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,392
I'm getting a recompilation
of that Sass into the CSS.

447
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:46,600
And DevTools is like, hey,
you just changed your CSS.

448
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,550
Let me show it to you.

449
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,050
OK.

450
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,880
Cool.

451
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,950
So that's pretty good.

452
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,820
And this looks good to me.

453
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,070
I'm going to change one more
thing about this behavior

454
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,520
while I'm here on my phone.

455
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,210
This text box, it's
cool, but it needs

456
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,070
a little bit of spicing up.

457
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,210
So I'm going to improve
things a little bit.

458
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,570
I'm going to jump into the
script file and hit Command O

459
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,880
and jump into script.js.

460
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,550
And I know the function that
I want to take a look at,

461
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,000
so I'm going to hit Command
Shift O and dive into update

462
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,651
search.

463
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:22,150
I'm going to add in one little,
small piece of functionality

464
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,990
here.

465
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,520
I'm just going to tweak
things every time I

466
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,770
type into the search box.

467
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,500
Wow.

468
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,166
WebKitTransform.

469
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,600

470
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,680
The prefixes are on their way.

471
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,090
We're working on it.

472
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,740
All right.

473
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,740
So this looks good to me.

474
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,360
Math.random()360.

475
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,920
I think it's going to be great.

476
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,560
So what I'm doing
is I just finished

477
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,380
typing that script out.

478
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,020
I'm just going to hit Save.

479
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,280
And when I hit Save, the
new function definition

480
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,091
gets sent to V8,
and V8's like, Oh.

481
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:03,590
New.

482
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,150
Got it.

483
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,843
Cool.

484
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,343
I'm not refreshing
the page, but I'm

485
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:09,190
going to just come over
here and start typing.

486
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,280
And all right.

487
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,710
Nice.

488
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,440
An improvement.

489
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,010
Right?

490
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,140
Right?

491
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,270
I think so.

492
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,760
But this is really nice.

493
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,380
I just updated the Sass,
had it show up live.

494
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,710
I just undid the JavaScript.

495
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,730
It evaluated live.

496
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,300
I didn't refresh the page at
all, and I'm going really fast.

497
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,230
I'm liking what I'm
doing so much that I'm

498
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,710
going to come over here.

499
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,756
Let's get diff.

500
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:32,620
Yeah.

501
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,530
I just remote debugged my
phone, made these changes over

502
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,220
on my phone.

503
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,850
I mean I'm seeing it
here on my screen,

504
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,790
but the changes are
also saved to disk.

505
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:47,240
Over in variables.CSS,
I have my change here.

506
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,490
My big CSS was recompiled, and
then, of course, my JavaScript

507
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,635
change here, too.

508
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,010
So all this is
persisted to disk,

509
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,050
and I'm pretty happy with it.

510
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,710
So I'm just going to get commit.

511
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,266
So good.

512
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:01,765
OK.

513
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:04,780
I'm not going-- because who
wants that thing to happen?

514
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,512
That's just crazy.

515
00:20:06,512 --> 00:20:07,012
All right.

516
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:07,710
Cool.

517
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,776
Let's come on back now.

518
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:10,276
All right.

519
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,260
All right.

520
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,400
So the DevTools
support for Sass that I

521
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,500
showed you is not Sass-specific.

522
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,290
It's generalized
for anything that

523
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,540
outputs source maps in CSS.

524
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Less, just added
this in Less 1.5.

525
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,800
In fact, here's a quick
video of this in action.

526
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,650
This is a little
bootstrap page coming in.

527
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,390

528
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,800
And what we do is we just
select the well in bootstrap.

529
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
And when you see
it's a Less file,

530
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,720
we're going to Command click
just like we did before,

531
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,240
apply a little darken
function and hit Save.

532
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,350
The recompile happens.

533
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,160
We bring in the new CSS, and
you get to go really fast.

534
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,970

535
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,810
I also know that
work is happening

536
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:06,310
to bring source maps to
Autoprefixer, to Compass,

537
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,210
and I hear rumors about
Stylus considering it as well.

538
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,880
So all this paints a really
nice picture of DevTools

539
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,330
giving me a lot of
powerful features

540
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,670
when it comes to editing and
authoring and iterating fast.

541
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,927
All my changes can
be saved to disk.

542
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:23,260
I can be editing Sass and
Less and getting those updates

543
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,760
directly.

544
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,110
I can be editing anything,
really, in this project-- C++,

545
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,810
Markdown, the whole thing.

546
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,089
This also means that
if I'm authoring here

547
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:36,380
inside the DevTools, I can
also be placing breakpoints.

548
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,213
This is really nice.

549
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,530
I hit breakpoints.

550
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,880
I find my bug.

551
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,690
I fix it.

552
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,330
I hit Command S,
and V8 immediately

553
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,880
gets that new thing.

554
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,200
I then see that the bug
is gone, and I'm all good.

555
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,300
I never had to refresh
the page at all.

556
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,780
So I get the nice live edit
revaluation right on the fly.

557
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,430
If you make a mistake and
you don't want that change,

558
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,810
Command Z all your way back.

559
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,550
It works everywhere.

560
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,250
And I can do all this
while I'm remote debugging.

561
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,940
It's the same powerful
feature set on the phone.

562
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,900
So a lot of what I
showed today is new-ish.

563
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,450
And, in fact, there's
a brand new beta

564
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,600
for Chrome and Android,
Version 32, shipping today.

565
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,230
So I encourage you
to grab that if you

566
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,500
want to be able to replicate
everything that I showed.

567
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,800
And, of course, everything is
moving very fast on desktop.

568
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,110
The mobile emulation
features that I

569
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,697
showed have been landing
over the past few weeks.

570
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:33,280
And there's some great stuff,
so definitely grab Chrome Canary

571
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,160
and check out the latest
and greatest there.

572
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,000
And I was putting together
this presentation,

573
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,280
and I took a step back, and
I just had this Keanu moment.

574
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,050
And I was just like, whoa.

575
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,910
Because I was like, I
now have this insight

576
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,140
as to what are the actual GPU
characteristics on the phone,

577
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,287
and I can see that happening.

578
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,870
These things I didn't
even show-- this

579
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,570
is a flame chart of the
JavaScript evaluation

580
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,260
of a WebGL experience.

581
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,290
And I can see what my most
expensive functions are

582
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,320
and quickly drill into
that, very quickly,

583
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,130
or do a canvas or WebGL
profile and gain insight

584
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,830
into the characteristics
of how that's executing.

585
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,860
It's a lot going on.

586
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,960
This is moving fast.

587
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,560
But all in all, it's
giving you a lot

588
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,020
of insight in how to
make user experiences

589
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,730
across multiple devices that
are fluid, fast, and awesome.

590
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,490
So a lot of this is documented
at devtools.chrome.com.

591
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,760
I encourage you
to check that out.

592
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,960
And, please, if
you have any bugs,

593
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,600
feature requests, anything for
the DevTools, holler at me.

594
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,308
Just let me know.

595
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:32,630
I'll make it happen.

596
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,079
I'll do my best.

597
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,370
And thank you, guys, very much.

598
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:40,526
[APPLAUSE]
