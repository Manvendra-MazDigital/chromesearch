00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,320
I work on the Chrome team.

3
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,670
I work as a Developer Advocate
on the Polymer project.

4
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,030
So we're going to be talking
about Web Components, which is

5
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,050
a totally cool, new technology
that the Chrome team's been

6
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,860
working on for a long,
long time.

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,920
Super stoked about it.

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,100
Super cool to spread
it with developers.

9
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,950
I want to learn about how
developers are building modern

10
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,740
web apps and teach them these
new practices using Web

11
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,400
Components.

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,870
I want to know about how they
architect apps, how we can

13
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,190
bring that back into the
standards process, feed the

14
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,520
engineering team here at Google,
work with them very

15
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,020
closely on that sort of thing,
and have this really awesome

16
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,570
type feedback loop.

17
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,660
And bring that back to the
Chrome team, we can build that

18
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,690
in the standards process and
have everyone then benefit in

19
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,890
the web community from adding
these APIs to the platform.

20
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,530
Hey, guys.

21
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,630
My name's Eric Bidelman.

22
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,110
I'm a Chrome Developer
Advocate.

23
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,950
We're going to be talking about
Web Components, going to

24
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,660
be talking about a little
bit of Polymer.

25
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,350
It's really exciting times
for web development.

26
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,310
You can build components,
define new tags in HTML.

27
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,550
It's going to make your life
entirely more productive than

28
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,560
you ever, ever thought
imaginable.

29
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,810
See you guys there.

30
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:04,690
