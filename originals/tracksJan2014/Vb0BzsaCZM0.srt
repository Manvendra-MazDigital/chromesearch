00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,984
Welcome to Google Developers
Weekly for November 25, 2013.

3
00:00:03,984 --> 00:00:05,900
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,566
of what's happening in the world
of Google Developers on the set

5
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:09,420
and off.

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,970
It was an incredible week for
developers here at Google.

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,720
So let's get right to it,
and we'll start with Glass.

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,990
Timothy Jordan, never seen
without his trademark hat,

9
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,290
gave us a sneak peek of the
brand new Glass Development

10
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:19,960
Kit.

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,300
The GDK lets us glimpse the
future of cool apps on Glass.

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,770
Also last week, we hosted
the Chrome Dev Summit,

13
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,310
an incredible two-day
web platform experience.

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,610
This event featured an
overwhelming 12 plus hours

15
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,770
of presentations on Dart, Blink,
Page Speed, PNaCl, and more.

16
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,560
If you missed anything, we
have it archived for you.

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,290
And if that wasn't
enough, Colt McAnlis

18
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,400
teamed up with the TimesOpen
team from the New York Times

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,274
to talk about tuning
websites and mobile apps

20
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:43,350
for performance.

21
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,440
You have a need for speed,
and so do your users.

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,900
And we've all seen the headlines
about large-scale password

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,640
leaks.

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,170
Breno de Medeiros
and Tim Bray, who

25
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,560
are not excited
about this trend,

26
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,770
talk about best practices
and raw survival

27
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,480
on how to keep your accounts
and information safe.

28
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,481
And Drive and Gmail are
getting closer together.

29
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:01,230
Steve Bazyl highlights
the new integration

30
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,930
of Gmail attachments
and Drive and what

31
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,196
this means for developers
on your Drive apps.

32
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:07,570
But Drive isn't the only Google
app getting new features.

33
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,028
Jonathan Simon
walks us through how

34
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,700
you can set up and use a
Google Cloud SQL instance.

35
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,350
This event covers
creating a database

36
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,290
and connecting to it, setting
up PHP pages, and much more.

37
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,620
If your app is up in the clouds,
make sure you watch this video.

38
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,780
We then welcome back
YouTuber Ikai Lan

39
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,410
from New York as
he tells us where

40
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,800
to go for all the latest
information on our Java API

41
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,970
client libraries.

42
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,310
Whether you use Maven or
Gradle, Ikai has your answers.

43
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,030
And we're celebrating the half
birthday of Google Play games.

44
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,740
But you're getting the gift.

45
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,000
Todd Kerpelman is giving
everybody updated SDKs.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,329
So watch this event
for all the fun.

47
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:41,870
And every year at
this time, the days

48
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,680
get very short or very long,
depending on where you live.

49
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,610
And Google Code-in gets going.

50
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,870
Pre-university students can
sign up for Google Code-in

51
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,500
and work on real world
open-source software projects,

52
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,560
learn a lot, and
even win prizes,

53
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,360
including a trip
to the Googleplex.

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,540
Check out the program
site to find out more.

55
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,900
Also, the Google
Civic Information API

56
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,512
got an important upgrade
for US users this week.

57
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:04,220
Now you can write apps
that connect users

58
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,770
to their local
elected government,

59
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,973
all the way down to
municipal officials.

60
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:10,139
And our newest Chrome
experiment, "A Journey Through

61
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,140
Middle-earth,"
launched this week.

62
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,210
It's an interactive
experience for "Hobbit" fans.

63
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,668
And for mobile web
developers, it's

64
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,440
a great demonstration of what's
possible on mobile devices

65
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,600
using HTML5 and technologies
like the Touch Events API, Web

66
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,620
Audio API, and Media Queries.

67
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,620
And SPDY, S-P-D-Y, is
our experimental protocol

68
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,540
for making the web faster,
and it's doing a great job.

69
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,160
This week we published
results showing

70
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,190
that SPDY has dramatically
reduced latency

71
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,970
in Google's major
web applications,

72
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,150
and the SPDY work continues.

73
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,100
And to make sure you never
miss a thing, speedy or slow,

74
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,870
from the world of
Google Developers,

75
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,880
subscribe to the Google

77
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,700
I'm Louis Gray, and I'll
see you in the studio.

78
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:59,559
