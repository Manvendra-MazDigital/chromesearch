00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,270

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:08,790
COLT MCANLIS: Hello everyone.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,440
My name is Colt McAnlis.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,660
I am the team lead for the
performance section of Chrome

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,890
Developer Relations.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,550
And tonight, I want to talk to
you about the joys of static

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,680
memory JavaScript.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,500
Now, I'm going to let you know
that I gave a great talk at

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,570
the HTML5 DevCon earlier this
year in April, and I had a

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,010
little section in my talk
about static memory

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,490
JavaScript.

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,509
And bar none, the most questions
I got was about

13
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,820
static memory JavaScript.

14
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,090
And so I actually went back,
and I actually wrote this

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,610
presentation a couple
months ago.

16
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,790
And I was very happy that Peter

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,490
allowed us to do it tonight.

18
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,270
But it was really interesting,
because when we tried to get

19
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,150
this thing together, really,
it was a one-off shot.

20
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,310
We had to get the guys from
Europe in town, and they only

21
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,630
had availability for a window.

22
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,840
And then we had to figure out
what day of the week we had

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,850
availability for Google's
facilities and catering and

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,870
all this other crazy stuff.

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,900
And it was the most random shot
in the dark for us to end

26
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,310
up on September 19.

27
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,570
Now, I'm in a room
full of nerds.

28
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,280
Does anyone know what
September 19 is?

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,735
AUDIENCE: Arr!

30
00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:12,330
AUDIENCE: Talk like
a pirate day.

31
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,660
COLT MCANLIS: Yarr!

32
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,760
AUDIENCE: Arr!

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,340
COLT MCANLIS: Now, I'm a very
simple man, and I had to stand

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,740
in the mirror a couple of days
ago, and I had to ask myself

35
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,470
how much of a man I was if I
could take this opportunity to

36
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,340
give a talk on the most random
shot day to be able to give a

37
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,320
talk in front of a roomful of my
fellow nerds, and actually

38
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,865
do the entire thing
as a pirate.

39
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:43,300
AUDIENCE: Arr!

40
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,040
AUDIENCE: Arr!

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,590
COLT MCANLIS: My wife didn't
believe this was possible.

42
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,560
I showed it to her on Google
that this was a thing.

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,410
And so I'm going to ask you
tonight, can we do this?

44
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,960
AUDIENCE: Arr!

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,100
COLT MCANLIS: Listen,
ya bilge rats!

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,410
I'm asking ya can we do this?

47
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,520
AUDIENCE: Arr.

48
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,260
COLT MCANLIS: One more time.

49
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,790
We've been giving
ya free booze.

50
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,195
Give it to me again!

51
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:07,045
AUDIENCE: Arr!

52
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,710
COLT MCANLIS: Arr, now
that's the crew I be

53
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,370
looking to have tonight.

54
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,730
Aye.

55
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,500
Now, tonight we be talking about
one thing in common.

56
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,480
We be slaying the
waste monster.

57
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,150
Its vile tentacles be keeping
your applications

58
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,140
from going too fast.

59
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,240
I lost me leg and
got a new one.

60
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,490
That's why I hate it.

61
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,490
My name is Captain Main Roach,
and I'm here not to save your

62
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,340
bodies, because the monster
be taking those.

63
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,530
I'm here for your souls.

64
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,900
Well, the applications' souls.

65
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,740
I really don't care about you.

66
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,100
But we need a refund on the--

67
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,250
I'll get to my point.

68
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,400
If you be hearing anything
from Captain Main Roach

69
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,080
tonight that you want to be
tweeting, make sure you be

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,950
using the right hashtags,
because we had

71
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,050
those back in the day.

72
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,990
And also, be making sure that
you visit our web performance

73
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,540
group on Google+.

74
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,050
It be a great place for
a bunch of mootin--

75
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,150
mootineers?

76
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,235
That came out wrong.

77
00:03:00,235 --> 00:03:00,520
All right.

78
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,860
This is a little
well-rehearsed.

79
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,070
Make sure you visit it.

80
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,500
Sign up at goo.gle/webperf.

81
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,630
Now, listen here,
you [INAUDIBLE]

82
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,630
yellow-bellied dogs.

83
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,220
I'm not here to listen to you
wallow and wane about whether

84
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,220
or not you like the JavaScript
garbage collector.

85
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,740
I'm here to tell you that it be
a vile beast that be taking

86
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,710
everything from ya.

87
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,150
Because as it does its evil
task, it's going to be taking

88
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,380
away a little bit of your
framerate every single time.

89
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,640
And I'm not here to
debate your dogma.

90
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,800
I dinnae care what gods you
[INAUDIBLE] to, be that of

91
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,440
managed memory, or
static memory, or

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,030
dynamic, anything else.

93
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,610
I'm here to worship one god
alone, and that be the one of

94
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,190
application speed.

95
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,170
Can you say arr?

96
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,112
AUDIENCE: Arr!

97
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:44,525
COLT MCANLIS: One
more time, arr!

98
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:45,000
AUDIENCE: Arr!

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,585
COLT MCANLIS: Aye, application
speed!

100
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:49,930

101
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,400
So stow your noise tonight.

102
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,770
I won't be debating whether or
not JavaScript's the best

103
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,200
language or the worst
language.

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,400
But I'll be telling you how to
make your applications fast,

105
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,650
because that's why
you're here.

106
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,421
Aye?

107
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,343
AUDIENCE: Aye.

108
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:01,265
COLT MCANLIS: Aye.

109
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:02,150
You're learning.

110
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,780
That's good.

111
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,100
So I'll tell you the trouble
with memory.

112
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,040
Now, many of you may not be
versed in the wild seas of

113
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,270
sailing around memory
problems.

114
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,980
But I'll tell you,
I've been there.

115
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,520
I lost me hair and me family.

116
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,220
It be a vile place to be.

117
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,420
From the depths of Hell, memory
management come and it

118
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,589
take everything in your life.

119
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,620
I'm here, but a husk of a man,
trying to make sure you do not

120
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,960
follow the same path.

121
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,080
Let's tell you why.

122
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,490
So when you're out sailing with
your buccaneers, having a

123
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,610
good time writing your web
applications, sooner or later,

124
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,050
one of you's going
to drop dead.

125
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,200

126
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,790
In your web application, one of
them will be running around

127
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,600
allocating memory or adjusting
the Dom, and sooner or later,

128
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,310
it'll have one too many
pints of beer and die.

129
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,060
We're pirates.

130
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,640
It happens.

131
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
But now I tell you this.

132
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,410
Its corpse won't go away.

133
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,190
No, your crew have better things
to do than remove it.

134
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,130
Instead, you'll leave it on the
ground festering when the

135
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,850
rats come and pick at its bones,
and the gnats come and

136
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,310
lay in its eye sockets,
and the gulls come and

137
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,730
feast on its flesh.

138
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,970
And only then, only then, when
the monster gets a whiff of

139
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,240
the piles of corpses that you've
been leaving around in

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,090
your application, only then
will it summon its bulbous

141
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,700
arms to your poop deck.

142
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,860
Poop deck joke, that's good?

143
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,340
Poop deck?

144
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,160
We're in poop deck jokes.

145
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,410
OK.

146
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,030

147
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,030
And when this beast come and
find your vessel, it dinnae

148
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,920
know who's living
and who's dead.

149
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,710
It's a blind beast filled
with hate and rage.

150
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,970
It'll bring its tentacles up
aboard your vessel, and it'll

151
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,860
sniff every one of your crew
to figure out which one be

152
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,460
inactive and which one still
be on the stack ready to be

153
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,750
used again at a future date.

154
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,240

155
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,270
And when it finds its evil prey
that it be eating on,

156
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,730
it'll take it away from you.

157
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,280
And only then will your dinghy
be operating at peak

158
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,370
efficiency now that all the
corpses have been hauled away

159
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,385
on your behalf, you
lazy captain.

160
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:04,450
But I tell you this, the
beast takes away

161
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,650
as much as it giveth.

162
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,190
Because your schooner be going
fast on its mission.

163
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,060
It be hitting 60 knots
per second.

164
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,660
Everyone knows that's the
magical speed of a boat.

165
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,980
And as it be going at 60 knots
per second, all of a sudden

166
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,430
those piles of corpses will rise
high, and you'll hear it.

167
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,545
You'll hear the vile beast
coming from afar, its hate and

168
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:27,760
its dread and its demon-filled
life

169
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,080
coming aboard your vessel.

170
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,020
And it'll stop you.

171
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,880
And it'll take away those knots
and stop you to zero.

172
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,240
And all of your men aboard your
ship will stand idly and

173
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,140
wait for it to do its
demon-filled task.

174
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,630
Meanwhile, your users are
standing there asking why your

175
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,350
ship is not moving.

176
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,170
And you can't be like, it's
the monster, it's not me,

177
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,750
because they blame
the captain.

178
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,470
And then you get fired, and
you have to talk like

179
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,870
a pirate all day.

180
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,800
And when it's done with its
deadly task, it'll let you on

181
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,880
your way, only to catch you
again in the future.

182
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,210
This be the cycle that it lives
and breathes off of,

183
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,680
your reluctancy to allow the
corpses to lay around, because

184
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,960
you've got better things
to do, like CSS.

185
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,500

186
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Arr, I be a ventured pirate from
back in the days of C++,

187
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,730
where a man had to manage his
own memory and his, you know,

188
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,860
stack overflows and threading
problems and kernel issues.

189
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,960
But it be a simpler time then.

190
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,580
We didn't really have
user interfaces.

191
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,980
It was mostly command prompt.

192
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,136
Moving on.

193
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:34,010
And what you be needing to know
is that this monster can

194
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,890
strike at any time, any
time it chooses.

195
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,860
It doesn't matter what you
think it should be doing.

196
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,750
It's going to do
what it wants.

197
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,240
Be it in a call back handler or
when the frame is updating,

198
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,590
any time your JavaScript-style
dinghy be floating on the

199
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,730
water, it'll rear its ugly
head as it sees fit.

200
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,770
And you should know that the
most important thing about

201
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,080
your vessel is that it
stays constant at

202
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,460
60 knots per second.

203
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,350
It doesn't care what you want.

204
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,470
It clears for the flesh
it's come to claim.

205
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,480
Aye?

206
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,400
AUDIENCE: Aye!

207
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
COLT MCANLIS: I see some
scared in the house.

208
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,610
They're like, where is
he going with this?

209
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,470
Are we talking about
memory or fishing?

210
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,870
I'm really unclear right now.

211
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,550
Don't worry.

212
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,800
It'll come down.

213
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,700

214
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,250
Now, here is a great
chart, lads.

215
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,560
You yellow-bellied sea bedders
may be looking at me and

216
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,770
going, listen to this angry man
who be thinking garbage

217
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,920
collection's a bad thing.

218
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,330
I'm a friend with that beast.

219
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,180
We go drinking on
Friday nights.

220
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,820
No, it is not your friend.

221
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,570
It's just using you for free
drinks on Friday nights.

222
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,760
I've been there once--

223
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,960
we'll talk about that later.

224
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,169
If you get nothing from me
diatribe this evening, I want

225
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,830
to be remembering this one.

226
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,330
This is a map built by the
most evil and satanic of

227
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,970
scientists.

228
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,600
They've followed this
beast around.

229
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,420
And what you be looking
at here is two

230
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,920
distinct groups of lines.

231
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,540
The first group is done by the
responsible captains who send

232
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,200
their crew to the evil task of
managing the dead themselves.

233
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,950
Now, aye, it does take a little
bit more memory for the

234
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,760
captain to ensure that the crew
is doing the right thing,

235
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,440
tossing its shipmates
overboard.

236
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,600
But you can see on the other
side is the one where the

237
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,850
kraken, the evil corpse
monster, be doing

238
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,140
the work for you.

239
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,770
Now, these lines mean
nothing right now.

240
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,010
But I'll tell you what
they do show.

241
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,240
On the bottom line here, these
numbers chart out how much

242
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,430
memory the system has relative
to the application that be

243
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,720
running-- oh, for your nautical
folk, how big the sea

244
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,310
is compared to the size
of your ship, aye?

245
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,760
Aye?

246
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,720
AUDIENCE: Aye!

247
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,980
COLT MCANLIS: Aye!

248
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,020
More beer, aye.

249
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,380
Now, what you be seeing here is
three distinct areas that I

250
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,480
wish to be pointing out this
evening, because you'll find

251
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,670
the treasures soon, aye.

252
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,440
First is you see the bad zone.

253
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,220
If your memory is between two
and four times the size of

254
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,270
your vessel, ye be screwed.

255
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,500
[LAUGHS]

256
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,080
You want to know why?

257
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,630
Because this kraken beast,
this hate-filled demon

258
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,900
vile-covered spawn monster
be larger than you think.

259
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,550
And when the body of water that
your schooner be floating

260
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,930
in be small, it has nowhere to
put its hefty load of lard, so

261
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,470
it must put it upon your
vessel, all the

262
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,092
way on the poop deck.

263
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:20,300
You asked for more
poop deck jokes.

264
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,390
I'm going to give them to you.

265
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,752
You have to laugh now.

266
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:23,160
AUDIENCE: Ha.

267
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,595
Ha.

268
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:25,810
Ha.

269
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,840
COLT MCANLIS: Yarr,
pity laugh.

270
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,520
Now, when you end up in this
second region here, you're

271
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,410
doing a little bit better.

272
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,470
You can see that four to six
times the size of your memory

273
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,420
requirements, arr, you be about
average compared to what

274
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,970
your crew be doing manually.

275
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,540
This is about the sweet spot on
mobile devices today, these

276
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,220
little devices that they have
that track all of your

277
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,250
movements and your going about
eating your food and

278
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,260
plundering and pillaging and all
you're pirate ways, right?

279
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,880
This is where you be sitting
with your memory.

280
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,690
But unfortunately, that's not
where the sweet spot be for

281
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,570
your vessel.

282
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,100
Nay, your ship needs to be in a
wide open ocean, between six

283
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,740
and ten times the amount of
memory that your application

284
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,560
be needing.

285
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,400
And it's only then when you'll
start to see the hates from

286
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,120
this vile corpse monster
actually be mitigated, because

287
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,810
the water is able to hold its
massive rolls of flesh-eating,

288
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,142
corpse-filling, bile-drinking
fat.

289
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:24,390

290
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,670
Unless you're here,
ye be screwed.

291
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,480
So make sure that your
JavaScript-class schooner

292
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,860
knows what the size of the
water be going in.

293
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,090
If you remember nothing,
remember this graph tonight.

294
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,330
Arr.

295
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,560
AUDIENCE: Arr.

296
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,280
COLT MCANLIS: Now, I will tell
you, there be one vessel on

297
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,630
the seven seas that seems to
escape the corpse monster many

298
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,750
times, and in fact, many have
said that it be the fastest

299
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,910
JavaScript vessel in
all the world.

300
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,320
It is known as the
SS Emscripten.

301
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,760
Do you know the vessel?

302
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,000
AUDIENCE: Aye.

303
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,210
COLT MCANLIS: I said, do
you know the vessel?

304
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,010
AUDIENCE: Aye!

305
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,390
COLT MCANLIS: Aye.

306
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,310
You want to know why
it's so fast?

307
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,830
Because its captain is damned.

308
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,270
Aye.

309
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,540
Everyone's really confused
right now.

310
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,720
Is this an open-source boat
that we're talking about?

311
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,960
Because that means lots
of people are damned.

312
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,910
Open-source boat.

313
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,790
That would be interesting.

314
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,692
That's a new Kickstarter.

315
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,460
Yarr!

316
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,940
And the reason this captain be
damned is because you know

317
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,756
what he does?

318
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:22,970
He doesn't let his crew die.

319
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,740
Nay.

320
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,660
When he sails from port, the
first evil action he be doing

321
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,070
is he slaughters the lot of
them, slits their throats

322
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,240
standing on the deck and let
the blood flow across the

323
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,390
planks into the water, where the
sharks be feasting and the

324
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,640
gulls be squawking
and nesting.

325
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,490
And you know what he does?

326
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,750
He brings a single shaman
on board with his deck.

327
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,280
And that shaman doesn't let
these poor men die.

328
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,130
Nay.

329
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,360
He keeps them in some trivial
state of not dead and not

330
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,190
living, not dead enough
for the corpse

331
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,760
monster to come aboard.

332
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,510
He manages the dead objects
on his ship, yarr.

333
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,314
Is anyone getting that yet?

334
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:01,760
OK.

335
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,025
And what he'll do is he'll
summon a corpse as he needs

336
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:06,150
it, and revive it, and then
send it back to dead by

337
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,530
slitting its throat again.

338
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,140
Aye, this be an evil captain,
but what he does well is he

339
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,040
escapes the kraken monster
once again.

340
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,540
It can never seem to catch this
SS Emscripten, because it

341
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,590
can never find it, because the
corpses never rot and ripen.

342
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,870
You see, this evil bile-flowing
covered with

343
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,610
boils and rank and fester
and alimony-taking--

344
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,860
um, uh--

345
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,710

346
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,430
OK, so I feel I should
tell you something.

347
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,750
It is true, the monster and
I were once in love.

348
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,740
Arr, um, you see, I was a young
buccaneer and hadn't

349
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,520
seen much of the world.

350
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,400
But you know that we grow, and
we change, and the monster and

351
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,810
I parted ways.

352
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,020
But we're not here to talk
about me tonight.

353
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,340
But he does take half of me
dubloons every month.

354
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,190
My job tonight be keeping you
away from the path that I be

355
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,040
taking and teaching you how to
use the techniques of the SS

356
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,530
Emscripten to keep your
dinghy moving fast.

357
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,830
So we'll start with your own
concept of a corpse pool.

358
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,250
So when you be getting your
mates on your vessel, make

359
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,750
sure to slaughter them thusly.

360
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,460
Usually across the
neck works fine.

361
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,580
If you get any fancier than
that, it's just showing off.

362
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,613
I mean, come on.

363
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:17,320
We be pirates.

364
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,860
We simple folk.

365
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,640
Now, when you need a task done
or you need a crewman to

366
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,990
achieve a goal for you, the
best thing to be doing is

367
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,130
reviving him.

368
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,460
Use your dark magic.

369
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,730
And what you need to be doing
is you need to remember that

370
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,610
is corpse, it has
the memories.

371
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,160
It remembers who
it used to be.

372
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,580
So when you grab it off its
corpse pool, you need to get

373
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,310
new clothes and set it
properties so it cannot

374
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,420
remember who it used to
be and instead assumes

375
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,820
the goal you want.

376
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,310
And when you have a
demon-summoned dead-filled

377
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,350
evil corpse to do your bidding,
you must usually make

378
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,400
sure that it follows that path
and it does the most evil,

379
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,950
heinous thing that you can task
it to, generally making

380
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,210
the world a worse place
for common folk.

381
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,950

382
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,375
Take a second to let that sink
in, a zombie on [INAUDIBLE].

383
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,630
That would get very awkward
very fast, yarr.

384
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,450

385
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,800
And when you're done with it,
much like the SS Emscripten,

386
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,890
you slit its throat and put it
back in the pool and let it

387
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,650
float away.

388
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,820
Again, this will keep the kraken
monster from actually

389
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,950
coming to board your deck and
taking away your speed.

390
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,250
And this is some hieroglyphs
from an ancient time, but I'll

391
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,610
walk through them anyway,
because I happen to speak it.

392
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,290
So you can see that to use such
a thing as a corpse pool,

393
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,590
the first thing you need to do
is actually grab a corpse and

394
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,420
revive it and then set its
properties accordingly, like

395
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,650
where it will spawn in
the universe, arr.

396
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,090
Do a jig.

397
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:37,810
Walk the plank.

398
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,710
And then when you're done, slit
its throat, throw it back

399
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,670
on the pool, and then make sure
that any clothes you may

400
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,850
have assigned to it
you cast overboard

401
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,140
to Davy Jones' locker.

402
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,280
He happens to sell things
out of the locker.

403
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,940
It's why it's a locker.

404
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,240
It's actually a secondhand
pirate store, see, yarr.

405
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,120
That's where we get most
of our clothes, arr.

406
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,000
What'll happen is when you use
this sort of pattern of corpse

407
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,100
pools or object pools, what
you'll be seeing is that your

408
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,270
memory will slowly
grow over time.

409
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,790
It'll be riding a wave that will
never end, and your ship

410
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,570
may never come back to shore.

411
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,830
It'll just slowly
be increasing.

412
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,250
Now what you'll notice, though,
is that ye be spending

413
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,952
a lot of time in here moving
in between all these ranks.

414
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:20,570
And it's worth noting that under
the hood, JavaScript may

415
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,340
be doing something that ye not
be planning as captain.

416
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,520
And as captain of your vessel,
you're in charge

417
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,850
of its fate, Aye?

418
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,750
AUDIENCE: Aye!

419
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,600
COLT MCANLIS: It's not in
charge of your fate.

420
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,270
It's a boat.

421
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,965
You're the captain, aye?

422
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:32,450
AUDIENCE: Aye!

423
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,190
COLT MCANLIS: So don't let
it do what you don't

424
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,024
want it to do, arr.

425
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:37,266
AUDIENCE: Arr.

426
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,400
COLT MCANLIS: Do you know under
the hood what happens

427
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,040
when you have a pool of
corpses and you add

428
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,870
another one to it?

429
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,895
Well, if you've actually maxed
out the number of corpses and

430
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:49,120
you add a new one, you know
what your boat be

431
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,900
doing behind your back?

432
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,180
It'd be creating a new pool of
corpses double the size.

433
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,850

434
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,140
That takes a lot of
extra memory.

435
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,660
I don't know how to say
that in Pirate better.

436
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,690
That was a little failure.

437
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,740
That's OK.

438
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,020
We're doing this on
the fly, arr.

439
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,190
Now, let's say your container
moving forward again, and once

440
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,470
again, you get to the point
where instead of 200 corpses,

441
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,110
ye added yet another, and then
you have to move again to 200.

442
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,450
To 400 corpses ye
be moving into.

443
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,170
Now, what is interesting about
this is that every time ye add

444
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,050
a corpse to the pile, your ship
have to go back to bay

445
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,460
and make more room.

446
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,060
Ye need to make changes to your
hull to accommodate all

447
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,680
the corpses ye be having
laying around.

448
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,310
But once your hull has
been destroyed, ye

449
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,600
have to rebuild it.

450
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,450
So you have to de-allocate the
previous array in order to

451
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,790
make room for the new one.

452
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,650
This creates more waste for the
corpse monster to come and

453
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,050
fester and bleed and
take away from ya.

454
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,570
It be taking your time, lads.

455
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,900
It's not a good thing, arr?

456
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,050
AUDIENCE: Arr.

457
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,300
COLT MCANLIS: Arr, you're
getting bored now.

458
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,100
Arr!

459
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,920
AUDIENCE: Arr!

460
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,520
COLT MCANLIS: Don't worry.

461
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,510
There be more booze soon.

462
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,780
Really, what ye need to be
thinking ahead as the captain

463
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,460
of your ship, how many dead
corpses will I need to get

464
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,380
this job done?

465
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,800
Yarr, tell that to
your manager.

466
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,600
That be CEO-level thinking
there, yarr.

467
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,100
Yes, yarr, ye see, we can't ship
a self-driving car, but

468
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,340
how many corpses can
we fit in it, yarr?

469
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,790
I guess that's a question ye
ask in Las Vegas, yarr.

470
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,250
Some people got that.

471
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,420
So what ye need to be
thinking of is how

472
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,480
many corpses ye need.

473
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,900
And instead of actually going
back to harbor many times and

474
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,120
rebuilding your ship and getting
more corpses, instead,

475
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,000
ye need to think ahead and hire
the corpses and kill them

476
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,945
ahead of time.

477
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:32,770
And the question that you have
as simple pirate folk who are

478
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,250
very bad at math is, how do you
determine the number of

479
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,750
people you'll need for this
evil task ye be setting

480
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,330
forward, and mostly, how many
knives will ye need, because

481
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,000
they kind of dull over time.

482
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,830
Now, the proper way to be doing
this is an iterative

483
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,850
testing loop.

484
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,640
Again, that really didn't
translate to Pirate.

485
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,380
Just follow with me.

486
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,760
It'll make sense in a minute.

487
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,790
So as yer ship be going out, ye
need to be running tests.

488
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,760
Ye need to run through what ye
think the average duration of

489
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,980
your journey be.

490
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,965
And ye need to be figuring out
how many corpses ye be needing

491
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:01,360
over that time.

492
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,710
And every time, you adjust and
change and rebuild your ship.

493
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,390
And as ye be doing all this, ye
be remembering, or logging

494
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,600
out, what your maximum number of
corpses be, or your average

495
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,260
number of corpses, or how
many of them are bald.

496
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,790
And ye be telling me, because
then I'll be upset with ye.

497
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,860
We're mostly discriminated
against as bald pirates.

498
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,450
We don't have the facial hair,
and so we can't go to all the

499
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,890
parties, yarr.

500
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,760
Once ye average been done
through this process, and

501
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,110
remembering how many corpses
ye may need for your final

502
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,910
journey, only then
can ye embark.

503
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,820
And when ye do your final
journey, you'll know ahead of

504
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,330
time how many objects to
reference and keep and how

505
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,680
many corpses to slay.

506
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,250
And what we'll end up seeing
is that your memory profile

507
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,840
will look a little bit more
stair-like, yarr.

508
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,710
AUDIENCE: Arr.

509
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,540
COLT MCANLIS: Yarr.

510
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,690
And the number of corpses ye
need will statically decrease.

511
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,340
And ye need not to go back to
the harbor so many times.

512
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,490
That means ye stay on the water
longer, and ye stay

513
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,710
faster more often, yarr.

514
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,500
AUDIENCE: Yarr.

515
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,230
COLT MCANLIS: The wind in
your sails be the best

516
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,850
wind of all, aye?

517
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,370

518
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,080
Now, sooner or later, you're
going to need to slit yet

519
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,310
another throat, even
though you've

520
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,540
pre-allocated your corpses.

521
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,400
And when you do this, you need
to be thinking back about what

522
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,840
your ship be doing without
your knowledge.

523
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,133
Will ye let it go ahead and
double the arrays every time?

524
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,095
AUDIENCE: Arr?

525
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:19,020
Narr?

526
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,710
COLT MCANLIS: That was the most
awesome response ever.

527
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,130
Yarr?

528
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,000
Narr?

529
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,910
Nay?

530
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,160
The best was I saw one guy over
here look at his buddy

531
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,526
and go, nay?

532
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:29,940
Narr?

533
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,560
No?

534
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,760
What if we just say no?

535
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,710
You think he'll point us out?

536
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,110
Quit talking.

537
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,000
He's looking at us.

538
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,310
The answer is nay, ye
not be letting the

539
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,220
ship do what it wants.

540
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,080
You're the captain.

541
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,040
You make the rules, yarr?

542
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
AUDIENCE: Yarr.

543
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,830
COLT MCANLIS: And instead of
allowing it to double in size

544
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,630
every time as your application
needs it and your Dom changes

545
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,750
and your objects move, instead,
ye be using what we

546
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,360
call a linear growth array,
where instead of actually

547
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,400
using the standard array object,
ye be using a linked

548
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,070
list of typed static arrays.

549
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,685
So as ye add a single object,
rather than doubling the size

550
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:05,030
of array, ye only increase
it by certain amounts.

551
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,830
Ye can be 100 corpses, or 1,000
corpses, or a platoon of

552
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,230
corpses if ye choose.

553
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,100
Either way, they're the King's
men, and they're free.

554
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,940
[LAUGHS]

555
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,990
Sorry for the British
in the audience.

556
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,330
Yes.

557
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,420
Now the linear growth array
actually be good, because ye

558
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,780
be amortizing the cost
of the corpses

559
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,730
over many, many corpses.

560
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,360
So every time ye allocate a
new array, you're actually

561
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,300
amortizing the death of all
those because ye do it once.

562
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:31,970
[LAUGHS]

563
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,490
It's tricky pirate math.

564
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,440
[LAUGHS]

565
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,380
Lookup be easy to do
in this structure.

566
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,160
Ye can simply index into it with
a little bit of magic and

567
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,870
fluff and dust.

568
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,090
Ye be finding what ye need.

569
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,190
However, deletion damn
near be impossible.

570
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,250
I do not recommend that.

571
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,860
Don't do that during
a job interview.

572
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,730
It will reflect on you badly.

573
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,860
I'm not saying I've done that,
but do not try that.

574
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,410
The point here be that this is
an apt-suited container for

575
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,020
the growth of static corpses
on your vessel.

576
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,070
It allows ye to grow.

577
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,400
It allows you to preallocate.

578
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,400
It allows ye to stay fluid
when times change, yarr.

579
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,850
And that be the pirate way.

580
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,810
Now, for all of ye in the
audience, ye may be saying to

581
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,020
yourself, I have no freaking
clue what my

582
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,030
memory be doing, yarr?

583
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,525
AUDIENCE: Yarr.

584
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:23,950
COLT MCANLIS: Yarr, welcome
aboard, mateys.

585
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,100
That was the most hearty yarr.

586
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,110
Yes, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

587
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,560
I am so lost right now.

588
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,880
Thanks for playing
along, lads.

589
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,100
For those of ye who be looking
to understand what's going on

590
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,520
under the hood of your deck,
you need to be looking at a

591
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,460
couple of tools.

592
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,350
To start off, stick with
Chrome Developer Tools.

593
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,460
It actually be giving ye a
pretty good understanding of

594
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,520
how many corpses and objects be
used along the duration of

595
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,800
your trip over time.

596
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,280
And with new tooling on the
bottom, it'll actually tell ye

597
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,110
what heap these corpses be
coming from, be they the audio

598
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,760
heap from the southern regions
of France, or they be the

599
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,210
rendering heap from Jamaica.

600
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,550
[LAUGHS]

601
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,890
They be a spicy lot, lads.

602
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,060
[LAUGHS]

603
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,400
Anyhow, stop here.

604
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,740
Make sure ye run your
application through the tools,

605
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,890
figure out where your memory
is going, and adjust

606
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,560
accordingly.

607
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,425
Ye be the captain, aye?

608
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:13,790
AUDIENCE: Aye.

609
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,920
COLT MCANLIS: Another great tool
that's just come out--

610
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,200
however, the shitty picture was
all I could find on the

611
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,040
internet, because for some
reason, they don't have anyone

612
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,940
who could put up a more
high-resolution photo of the

613
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,270
damn tool--

614
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,543
is a good tool called
Adobe GCview.

615
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:30,490
And no, I couldn't get it
working, so I couldn't take

616
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,470
the picture myself, yarr.

617
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,010
This is a fantastic external
tool that will allow ye to do

618
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,560
memory profile analysis
for multiple

619
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,500
different browsers, yarr.

620
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,910
So for those of ye out here who
may be saying, oh, Captain

621
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,090
Main Roach, you're kind of off
the plank with Chrome only,

622
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,080
check these out.

623
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,300
But seriously, put up
a better picture.

624
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,950
That's kind of embarrassing.

625
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,130
I'm a pirate, and I'm calling
ye out, yarr.

626
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,185
So lads and lasses, my crew
tonight, thank ye for

627
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:56,690
listening to me.

628
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,400
Let me give you some tips
on how to avoid this

629
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,860
evil-building mulch monster.

630
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,670
First off, know that this
monster be eating away at the

631
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,460
speed of your ship, and
that not be good.

632
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,490
If you don't see that garbage
collection be hurting your

633
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,810
framerate, you're not
trying hard enough.

634
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,790
Build a better application.

635
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,080
Yarr, I'm calling
ye out, yarr.

636
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,920
AUDIENCE: Yarr.

637
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
COLT MCANLIS: Yarr.

638
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,676
T-shirt for that man.

639
00:24:18,676 --> 00:24:22,330
The rest of ye, to the planks.

640
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,140
High corpse churn summons
the monster.

641
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,630
If ye be moving lots of objects
around and not doing

642
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,680
yer duty, then the corpse
monster will find ye, it'll

643
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,170
slow down your vessel, and then
you'll be cursing all day

644
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,084
long, and I will be sitting
back laughing.

645
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:35,750
[LAUGHS]

646
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,830
Kill your crew before
you sail.

647
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,030
Sail them as zombies.

648
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,585
I dare every one of you in here
to tweet that right now.

649
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:48,600
Kill your crew before you sale,
hashtag #perfmatters.

650
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,610

651
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,290
The bald pirate told
me to say it.

652
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,890
I'm not crazy.

653
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,605
Know your course count
by testing your

654
00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:58,670
voyage ahead of time.

655
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,140
Be the captain of your vessel.

656
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,350
Don't let it control you.

657
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,323
You're in charge, yarr.

658
00:25:03,323 --> 00:25:04,170
AUDIENCE: Yarr.

659
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:04,620
COLT MCANLIS: That one hurts.

660
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,126
Hold on.

661
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:07,030
Oh.

662
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,200
I needed to stretch my yarr.

663
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,800
When you need more corpses, make
sure ye linearly grow.

664
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,160
Don't allow the ship to do it.

665
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,420
You do it yourself.

666
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,122
In honest, I miss the
corpse monster.

667
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:23,770
We did separate, and there
were little'uns involved.

668
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,970
But we'll be back soon.

669
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,590
With the new primitives in C++
11, there may be a chance to

670
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,050
get a better high-performance
application system where I may

671
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,570
not have to manage
my memory myself.

672
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,720
That's a separate discussion.

673
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,680
Anyhow, yarr thank ye all for
listening to me tonight.

674
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,990
And I'd like to remind ye that
we won't be taking questions

675
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,140
now but we will be doing it at
the end of the night in a

676
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,970
fireside-chat manner, yarr.

677
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,610
Thank ye be for listening
tonight.

678
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,210
AUDIENCE: Yarr!

679
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,460
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

680
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:59,637
