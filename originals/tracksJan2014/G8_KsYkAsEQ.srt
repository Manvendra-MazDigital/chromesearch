00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,580
DON DODGE: Hi, I'm Don Dodge,
and this is "Google Root

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,710
Access." Today we're going to
talk about open source--

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,200
how Google uses open source, and
how Google contributes to

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,360
open source.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,370
My guest today is Chris DiBona,
who runs the Open

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,080
Source Projects for Google.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,790
Welcome, Chris.

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,636
CHRIS DIBONA: Thanks, Don.

11
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:34,710
DON DODGE: So tell me, what
do you do at Google?

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,770
CHRIS DIBONA: So very basically,
if there's open

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,560
source at Google it's my
job and my team's job

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,130
to look after it.

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:47,370
And that includes all the code
we might use when creating

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,500
sites like google.com, and
Gmail, and all the docs and

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,070
spreadsheets and apps
that we have online.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,580
But also all the things
that we ship--

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,530
things like Android
and Chrome.

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,465
And if you have a Nexus device,
or if you're one of

21
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:04,440
the people who is a Google Glass
beta tester, you'll be

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,250
running open source
code on there.

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,300
Whether as part of the
proprietary software running

24
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,720
on top of it, or as a whole
open source ecosystem like

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,000
Android and Chrome.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,405
So we make sure that we ship
things within compliance of

27
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:24,490
those licenses, but also so that
those teams have correct

28
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,680
infrastructure as well.

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,570
So we look after all kinds of
infrastructure for Android and

30
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,870
some of the other
teams right now.

31
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,010
DON DODGE: So some people may
not know this, but Google's

32
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,630
roots are actually
in open source.

33
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,220
Google built its own servers
and used Linux, and hacked

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,080
Linux to do very interesting
things.

35
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,380
Can you tell us a little
about that?

36
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:45,610
CHRIS DIBONA: Sure.

37
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,150
Well, actually, if you look back
to when Larry and Sergey

38
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,040
were at Stanford and building
BackRub, which of course

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,980
became Google.

40
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,385
That was all written in Python
and using some fairly standard

41
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,200
web serving tools and libraries,
and they put the

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,520
uniqueness that was
Google on that.

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,680
So you had Python running on top
of Linux, running on top

44
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,000
of all kinds and all
manner of hardware.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,710
And as we grew up as a company,
we kept that ethos

46
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,450
where we would get what a lot
of people would consider

47
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:23,140
fairly trashy hardware, and we
would get our reliability from

48
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,380
the software layer.

49
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,560
And that was Linux, and that
was Python, and that was

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,770
eventually Java and
C and the rest.

51
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,520
And so we started with open
source in a lot of ways and

52
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,310
built on top of it, and it's
been a pretty healthy code

53
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,815
system since then.

54
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:45,560
DON DODGE: So Google not only
uses open source and used it

55
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,150
to build the base of Google, the
infrastructure of Google,

56
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,620
but Google also contributes
to open source?

57
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,590
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, to date
we've conservatively estimated

58
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,010
that we've contributed from
Google Developers about 50

59
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,780
million lines of code,
give or take.

60
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,490
And that spans everything from
Android and Chromium, all the

61
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,250
way through to compilers.

62
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,710
For instance, if you have any
consumer electronics device

63
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,530
that's been made in the last
five years, you're probably

64
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,240
running some Google code on it
and you don't even know it,

65
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,250
through the libraries that we've
contributed to and just

66
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,890
the vast number of projects
we've released,

67
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,830
so it's fairly shocking.

68
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,180
And this is not even taking
into account the vast

69
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,022
proliferation of Android, and
the technology inside Android.

70
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:33,710
DON DODGE: So the infrastructure
things--

71
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,040
BigTable and Hadoop.

72
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,370
Tell us a little bit about how
that evolved and what are some

73
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,000
of those open source projects
that either came out of

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,220
BigTable in Google's
infrastructure, or were

75
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,130
modeled after that.

76
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,000
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, so if you
look at Hadoop, we published a

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,950
paper back in 2000, I want to
say 2002 or 2003, about the

78
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,210
Google File System which
is called GFS.

79
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,520
And it inspired folks like Doug
Cutting to go out and

80
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,620
write open source
implementations of this

81
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,600
technology.

82
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,880
And that happens with a lot
of the things that we do

83
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,840
publications about, but
don't actually ship

84
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,900
as open source software.

85
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,519
So what you see coming from
Google is often, if we talk

86
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,130
about it, people will want it.

87
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,839
And if we don't release it
as open source, they'll

88
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,550
try to create it.

89
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,480
That's actually really
healthy.

90
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,110
And so you've seen a
proliferation of these kinds

91
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,650
of big data tools like MongoDB
and Redis and LevelDB and all

92
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,550
these really interesting
large-scale key

93
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,950
value stores and stuff.

94
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,130
And they have their roots in us
publishing papers about our

95
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,940
internal systems like BigTable
and NGFS and

96
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,290
Spanner and the rest.

97
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,550
DON DODGE: You mentioned
Chromium, Android, and some

98
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:56,150
other pretty major open source
products that Google has.

99
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,040
Are they licensed the same and
they are basically the same?

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,480
Or are they quite different
in how we handle them?

101
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,980
CHRIS DIBONA: So Chromium
and Android are

102
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,240
actually quite different.

103
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,040
If you look at Chromium, when
we wrote it we really wanted

104
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,660
to inspire other browser
manufacturers to, frankly, do

105
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,770
what we do.

106
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,180
And so we wanted to make it
possible for them to actually

107
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,370
use our code.

108
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,360
So beyond just contributing
to WebKit, we also made a

109
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,290
conscious decision to license
Chromium under BSD.

110
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,570
Because that code would then
be consumable by not just

111
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,210
WebKit-based browsers, but also
those of them that might

112
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,370
use Gecko, Mozilla.

113
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,910
Even Microsoft could take that
code and pull it into their

114
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,390
browser or their software, and
not just learn, but actually

115
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,170
just use what we're
publishing.

116
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,940
Because when we shipped
Chromium--

117
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,540
this is something a lot of
people don't understand-- when

118
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,150
we first shipped to Chrome and
Chromium, this was a time when

119
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,850
one tab getting slow would take
down your whole browser.

120
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,900
And we weren't really taking
advantage of the full

121
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,760
capabilities of a modern
CPU or modern hardware.

122
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,680
And so we really wanted to bring
that kind of processed

123
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,790
isolation, and also the security
in a sandbox to the

124
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,990
browser so that people could
feel the browser was a safe

125
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,040
place to work and to consume
information.

126
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,980
So we tried to convince other
browser manufacturers that

127
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,640
this was really important.

128
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,240
And we decided that it was time
to just do it, and do it

129
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,380
in such a way that they could,
if they ended up agreeing with

130
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,910
us later, just adopt the work.

131
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,500
And we've been moderately
successful

132
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,810
with that later mission.

133
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,970
But I think Chromium has been
very successful at showing

134
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,540
that you can take real advantage
of processed

135
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,610
isolation and sandboxing to
secure a web browser.

136
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,010
And I think that's really
important, and people miss

137
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,720
that all the time.

138
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,010
Now, Android's a different
story together.

139
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,520
With Android, we licensed
Android under the Apache

140
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,580
license with the kernel being
the GPL Linux kernel.

141
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,750
And we chose Apache for
a number of reasons.

142
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,810
Apache has this really awesome
language around patents.

143
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,750
So it says, hey, if you're using
our software and we have

144
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,350
patents that read on that
software, we're not going to

145
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,670
come and rent seek against
you for that software

146
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,110
unless you sue us.

147
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,120
So if you sue us, we're going
to retain the rights to use

148
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,660
those patents in the defense
of our company against you.

149
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,910
But otherwise, we're telling you
that you have nothing to

150
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,770
fear from Google and
from using Android.

151
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,400

152
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,190
And that was a really big deal,
and I think it really

153
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,730
mattered with the carriers.

154
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,750
Also, Apache has this unusual
aspect to it in the world of

155
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,530
open source where it says we
just want you to acknowledge

156
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,260
you're using it.

157
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,800
We don't need you to share
your source code, too.

158
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,070
And for the carriers who have
a lot of balls that they

159
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,830
juggle in the air at one time,
making compliance easier for

160
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,560
them is very important.

161
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,540
And I think it has a lot to do
with why Android is as popular

162
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,620
as it is with so many
manufacturers, and you know

163
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,090
that it's a real open
source project.

164
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,450
So companies will often
say hey, I've got

165
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,370
this open source thing.

166
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,880
And then you'll see that they're
the only ones running

167
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,380
it, and the only ones who
will ever run it.

168
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,470
And it comes down to trust,
and it comes down to what

169
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,070
license they use.

170
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,320
I think it's extremely telling
that when you look at a

171
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,500
Kindle, or you look at a Nook,
or you look at half a dozen

172
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,660
Android-based devices
that don't have

173
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,010
anything to do with Google.

174
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,390
That they continue to persistent
and exist, because

175
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,820
that's really open source.

176
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,970
We can't stop them, and
nor do we want to.

177
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,180
But even if we wanted to, we
couldn't stop them from using

178
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,110
the software.

179
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,929
And that's how you know it's
really open source.

180
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,730
DON DODGE: So I sort of
understand how open source

181
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,230
works and what it is.

182
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,020
But I'm confused about this
jumble of licenses, there's an

183
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,630
alphabet soup of licenses.

184
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,159
CHRIS DIBONA: You're
not alone.

185
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,540
DON DODGE: Can you say a little
bit about what are the

186
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,130
major licenses and
differences?

187
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,430
CHRIS DIBONA: Well, there's
three major

188
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,960
categories of licenses.

189
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,220
There's what we call the
permissive licenses, and they

190
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,170
basically say, here's some
code, Don, enjoy it.

191
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,330
And all we really ask from you
is that you mark in your about

192
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,860
box or in your documentation
that you're using it.

193
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,650
So those are the

194
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,460
permissive/notification licenses.

195
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,610
DON DODGE: What are some
examples of the [INAUDIBLE]?

196
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,700
CHRIS DIBONA: So that would be
BSD, that would be Apache,

197
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,380
MIT, ones like that.

198
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,810
And then there are the more
share alike style licenses.

199
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,260
And they say if I give my
software to Don and Don ships

200
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,830
something, well, then
he's obligated to

201
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,680
share his code, too.

202
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,450
For some definition of
share and use and all

203
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,210
the rest, of course.

204
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,800
But those are your GPL licenses,
your LGPL licenses,

205
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,560
and to a lesser degree the MPL
licenses as part of the

206
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,690
Mozilla tri-license.

207
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,180
So depending on which one it is,
you'd either have to share

208
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,890
more or less code, depending on
how you use that software.

209
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,730
And this stuff is deeply
confusing, so you shouldn't

210
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,450
feel like you're ignorant
of this stuff--

211
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,780
almost everyone is.

212
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,320
And it's not just a jobs program
for me and people like

213
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,650
me, it's just complicated
stuff.

214
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,940
Because these licenses, they
say how people feel about

215
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,280
sharing their software.

216
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,810
And when you talk about
feelings, things get confusing

217
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,450
and complicated.

218
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,200
And then the third category of
licenses are the ones that are

219
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,550
trying to also define network
performance as being the kind

220
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,000
of sharing that invokes the
resharing of software.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,550
So there are very few of these,
and they're applied to

222
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,640
very few actual pieces
of software.

223
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,470
But it's a version of
the GPL called the

224
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,620
Affero GPL, or the AGPL.

225
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,680
And so, for instance, we don't
use any AGPL software at

226
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,120
Google and we don't
allow it here.

227
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,980
And that would be like
MongoDB, and

228
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,910
RStudio and the rest.

229
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,600
And so in those cases, we either
purchase a commercial

230
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,680
license from those software
companies or we simply don't

231
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,355
allow them.

232
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:51,842
DON DODGE: So the AGPL, we
don't use that because--?

233
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:56,530
CHRIS DIBONA: Because as it
interacts with other software

234
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,220
and then is displayed on, say,
a google.com site or on a

235
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,830
Gmail or apps site, we would
then have to share more

236
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,180
software than we're comfortable
sharing through

237
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,126
the linking to that software.

238
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:13,590
DON DODGE: So if I'm a startup
and I'm building my company,

239
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,750
what do I need to look out for
in terms of using open source?

240
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,386
And which license should I have,
and that kind of thing?

241
00:11:20,386 --> 00:11:23,420
CHRIS DIBONA: Well, except for
the AGPL, you pretty much

242
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,900
don't have anything to worry
about as, say, a web startup.

243
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,230
If you're going to be shipping
software, that's a somewhat

244
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,660
longer conversation where you
try to suss out what the

245
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,490
startup wants to do, what
they're shipping, what they

246
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,760
want to share.

247
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,820
Because open source is, in my
mind, also a fundamental part

248
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,325
of a developer relations
strategy

249
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,230
and a developer ecosystem.

250
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,370
Without it you don't
have one, or it's a

251
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,820
very unfair one, frankly.

252
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,280
So what I tell startups when I
advise them is that when you

253
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,430
bring software into the company
that isn't written by

254
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,250
someone at the company, and
that means anything--

255
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,880
examples, software from places
like GitHub, or Stack

256
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,230
Exchange, or Stack Overflow--

257
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,650
you should always put these in
a special directory, like a

258
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,710
third party directory.

259
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,020
This is what we do at
Google, by the way.

260
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,000
We have millions of
these directories

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,740
all over the place.

262
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,910
Segregate the code--

263
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,230
you can absolutely,
unconditionally still use it,

264
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,740
you just want to keep it
out in a special place.

265
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,780
DON DODGE: In your code base
you actually segregate the

266
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,670
open source code and
you keep it there?

267
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,230
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah.

268
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,760
And so you have these third
party directories and then you

269
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,560
call that code in whatever way
you see fit, but then at least

270
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,860
you know where it is.

271
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,430
So there are other hygiene
things you can do, like make

272
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,020
sure you only have one version
of a specific library, even if

273
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,810
it's used across multiple
products.

274
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,270
Keeping up to date with security
[INAUDIBLE], all

275
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,830
these things that are
fundamental to development.

276
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,590
But keeping things separate
enough that you can keep on

277
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,900
identifying it is
pretty amazing.

278
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,510
If you have that, you're
better than 90% of the

279
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,320
companies out there.

280
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,730
DON DODGE: So that's
rule number one?

281
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,430
CHRIS DIBONA: That's
rule number one.

282
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,390
You have to be careful
with the AGPL.

283
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,950
So for instance, a lot of people
really like MongoDB

284
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,010
right now for what it does, and
that makes perfect sense.

285
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,820
And if you look at how MongoDB
is licensed and the way they

286
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,930
articulate that license,
it's very clever.

287
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,820
They have very smart client
licensing, which basically

288
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,720
doesn't transfer that network
obligation onto a website.

289
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,190
But the database itself is
something you have to, if you

290
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,020
make improvements to the
database, if you have certain

291
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,830
code interacting with the
database in certain ways, that

292
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,820
code may end up being shared.

293
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,620
So you'll just want to know that
when you're using tools

294
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,640
like MongoDB.

295
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,970
Magento is another really
popular shopping cart

296
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,640
application.

297
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,200
And it's not unfair to say
that this drives a lot of

298
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,540
license revenue to Magento and
MongoDB, and it's fair and

299
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,170
this is their deal.

300
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,830
They're saying listen, we want
you to use this stuff.

301
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,600
But if you use it in certain
ways, you should be paying us.

302
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,460
And so that's a commercial
software license that you

303
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,220
would get from them.

304
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,720
So that's the sort of thing we
see in acquisitions actually

305
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,970
quite a bit.

306
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,980
DON DODGE: Good point.

307
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,430
You also review acquisitions
for Google.

308
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,500
Every time Google does an
acquisition, you look at the

309
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,970
code and look for open source,
make sure it's licensed.

310
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,815
So say a little bit about what
you do in that process.

311
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:21,655
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, so for
instance, suppose you're a

312
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,730
startup that does something
with video.

313
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,380
You're probably using FFmpeg,
you're probably using it with

314
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,550
certain compile flags.

315
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,480
And most people don't even
know this, by the way.

316
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,950
At this point, by the time I
say compile flags, it means

317
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,490
there's a developer inside that
organization who built

318
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,880
that piece of software.

319
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,060
And I can actually tell from
the output that I, the

320
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,400
consumer, can see pretty
much what you've done.

321
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,760
So it's very easy for me to say,
OK, you're probably using

322
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,230
this, this, and this.

323
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,830
And they're like, who told
you what we're using?

324
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,110
And it's like, we know.

325
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,100
We've seen a million startups
like this, and so here's what

326
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,910
you'll have to do to be
compliant with these licenses.

327
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,270
So we have that discussion a
lot with companies, by deal

328
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,800
close you have to
do X, Y, and Z.

329
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,360
And it's funny, when I was
younger and maybe more

330
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,465
idealistic or less cynical, I
would say, I can't believe

331
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:09,120
these people are breaking
licenses in such

332
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,160
a fundamental way.

333
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,640
But what it is is most people's
intentions are pure.

334
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,490
They just don't know how to be
compliant with these licenses,

335
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,960
and sometimes it's actually
deeply complicated.

336
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,225
So oftentimes when we see
acquisitions come in, we'll

337
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:23,700
say, OK, if you want to keep
shipping this piece of

338
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,890
software, you have to do X and
Y and Z. And you've been

339
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,910
shipping this piece of software
for this long, so

340
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,920
you'll need to do this.

341
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,470
So that people who want their
rights under the open source

342
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,670
licenses which you have chosen
to use are going to be able to

343
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,340
be satisfied.

344
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,980
Because we like to in some
ways over-comply.

345
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,680
Put up mirrors of code so
that people can find the

346
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,460
information they want about open
source in your product

347
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,640
simply by googling for it.

348
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,210
It saves us a lot of time than
having to answer emails and

349
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,250
sit on mailing lists and worry
a lot about things.

350
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,170
So we try to bring people into
our level of compliance, which

351
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,750
is very high, by the
time a deal closes.

352
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,020
We've never had to scuttle a an

353
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,400
acquisition because of this.

354
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,490
I've seen acquisitions fall
apart, and this might be a

355
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,630
component of that, but
it's very rare.

356
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,260
It's more that bringing
discipline to your code base

357
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,760
for open source really has
higher implications about the

358
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,035
quality of the code
of the company.

359
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:24,615
DON DODGE: Overall?

360
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:25,840
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, exactly.

361
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,590
So it's extremely rare
to find somebody who

362
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,910
understands this stuff.

363
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,160
What's the right way
to say this?

364
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,740

365
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,180
If someone has a good, tidy
code base, then they're

366
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,230
usually also either very
compliant with open source

367
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,940
licenses already, or easily
able to become compliant.

368
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,120
If they're not compliant with
open source licenses and they

369
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,950
have an untidy code base, that
could have implications, too,

370
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,530
during an acquisition that have
nothing to do with the

371
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,260
open source license compliance
and everything to do with how

372
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,230
they develop and how they
bring software together.

373
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,410
It's more of an indicator.

374
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,814
DON DODGE: So if a startup is
using MongoDB, or Magento--

375
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,690
CHRIS DIBONA: Which a lot are.

376
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,630
It's a great tool.

377
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,460
They're both great tools.

378
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,310
DON DODGE: So what
happens then?

379
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,700
We just don't consider using
that kind of software?

380
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,210
CHRIS DIBONA: In rare cases we
have a pool of licenses for

381
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,349
them to draw upon, but we
keep that very limited.

382
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,650
Because usually when people come
to Google, they end up

383
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,890
transferring onto our technology
or we're shutting

384
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,140
their technology off.

385
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,620

386
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,180
It depends on the situation.

387
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,490
It's very hard to say we always
do X or we always do Y.

388
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,130
Because we want to remain
flexible for

389
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,750
these kinds of things.

390
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,660
There are some companies, and
I'm not going to name them,

391
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,490
where if you have GPL software
they will simply force you to

392
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,100
rip it out before they'll even
talk to you, much less let the

393
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,790
deal close.

394
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:56,990
So it's rare nowadays, but
it certainly happens.

395
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,240
And I'm not talking about
the Linux kernel.

396
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,480
Everyone's comfortable with
the Linux kernel.

397
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,140
It's sort of an accepted
thing that they have

398
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,010
to deal with that.

399
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:11,260
But for some GPL tools and
system libraries and web

400
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,620
frameworks and stuff,
they don't want

401
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,340
to have that around.

402
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,620
DON DODGE: Well, that's really
a competitive advantage for

403
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,955
Google and it has been
from the beginning.

404
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:19,390
CHRIS DIBONA: I would
consider it so.

405
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,710
Yeah.

406
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,700
For instance, if you reject all
GPL and LGPL code, you're

407
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,490
rejecting 75% of the open source
code that's out there.

408
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,390
And we're talking, I think it
was probably 35 million unique

409
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,090
files out there encompassing
maybe 5 billion lines of code.

410
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,990
So you would be rejecting 75%
of that just by saying, I

411
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,110
don't want to deal with
the GPL and the LGPL.

412
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,620
Again, it's a fine
decision to make.

413
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,035
I think it's very limiting.

414
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:47,360
DON DODGE: So Google roots are
in open source and we use open

415
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,940
source, we contribute
to open source.

416
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,140
CHRIS DIBONA: We create new open
source developers with

417
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,060
the Summer of Code.

418
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,330
I mean, we do a lot.

419
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,010
DON DODGE: Say more about
the Summer of Code.

420
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,710
You've been writing that program
for quite a while.

421
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,420
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, we're
coming up on our

422
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,150
ninth year, I believe.

423
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,860
And what that does is it
basically introduces students

424
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,030
to open source software.

425
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,830
It sets up a one-to-one
mentoring relationship between

426
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,260
open source software projects
and students.

427
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:16,390
So the idea was Larry Page was
uncomfortable that people were

428
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,330
leaving college for the summer
and then backsliding over the

429
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,850
summer because they had to
go get a job that wasn't

430
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,790
computer-related.

431
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,950
So he was like, if you could fix
that, that would be great.

432
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,820
And I was like, OK.

433
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,086
So we came up with the
Summer of Code as a

434
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:29,570
way of fixing that.

435
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,280
And the idea was we would give
people real world, real bug,

436
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,310
real problem experience
in open source.

437
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,220
And it would also expose them
to the world of open source

438
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,770
development.

439
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,190
I think that's been
an incredible good

440
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,560
for computer science.

441
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,540
We've only taken about
10,000 students

442
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,300
through the program now.

443
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,830
DON DODGE: 10,000?

444
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,910
That's a lot.

445
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,680
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah.

446
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,590
10,000, 9,000, yeah,
about that.

447
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,550
And we pay them over the
summer to do this work.

448
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,660
DON DODGE: So they actually
get paid to do this?

449
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,820
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah.

450
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,454
We spend a fair amount
of money.

451
00:19:58,454 --> 00:20:04,100
And they on average write about
3,000 lines of code that

452
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,450
ends up into open
source software.

453
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,905
So you can do the math
there, too--

454
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,400
it's a significant
amount of code.

455
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,500

456
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,740
When you're a computer
science student--

457
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,310
I don't know if you went through
CS school-- but you're

458
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,980
taught a lot of theory and a lot
of comparative programing

459
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,880
languages and algorithms
and that kind of thing.

460
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,380
You're not taught what
happens when a

461
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,360
user uses your software.

462
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,410
You're not taught what happens
when they decide to run it on

463
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,860
some horrible piece
of trash computer

464
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,870
that you never expected.

465
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,250
And open source software
projects are exposed to that

466
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,010
kind of real world usage
all the time.

467
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,760
And so you get a whole different
view into how to

468
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,970
make a software program work and
what users need by working

469
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,920
on open source.

470
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,690
And additionally, this is not
a we bring them into Google

471
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,060
and host them kind of program.

472
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,050
This is a wherever they are
all over the world.

473
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,600
We've done this in
93 countries now.

474
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,320
DON DODGE: Really?

475
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,880
CHRIS DIBONA: And paying
people in 93

476
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,210
countries is not easy.

477
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,080
But we've had students in pretty
much any country you

478
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,830
can think of in the
modern world.

479
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,640
Well, perhaps there's more
now that there's 273

480
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,970
countries in the UN.

481
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,770
It's been pretty remarkable to
see how these students turn

482
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,880
from these neophyte programmers,
really, into

483
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,580
pretty amazing remote
programmers, which frankly is

484
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,790
something that industry
struggles with.

485
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,210
Having remote developers is
extremely difficult, and open

486
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,520
source seems to figure it out.

487
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,120
And what it comes down to,
really, is the people who are

488
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,170
good at that kind of thing are
good at open source, and the

489
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,010
people who aren't, aren't.

490
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,315
So we had the failure mechanism
in the Summer of

491
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:41,570
Code as well where we probably
fail about 14%, 15% of the

492
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,750
students every year out
of the program.

493
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,530
And that means they
don't get paid at

494
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,580
some step of the program.

495
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,210
So maybe they'll get the
acceptance fee, but not the

496
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,030
mid-term or the final payment.

497
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,520
So it's very merit-based which
is also, I think, a key thing

498
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,430
about open source.

499
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,170
You either do a good job or
you're not part of it.

500
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,080
DON DODGE: Fascinating.

501
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,780
Well, thank you.

502
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,160
Thank you for being here today
and for your contributions to

503
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,130
open source at Google.

504
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:06,560
CHRIS DIBONA: Absolutely.

505
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:06,980
DON DODGE: It's terrific.

506
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,460
CHRIS DIBONA: Thanks
for having me.

507
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,140
DON DODGE: Thank
you very much.

508
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,230
Thank you for joining us.
