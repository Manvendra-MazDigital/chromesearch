00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,260
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to Google
Developers Live.

5
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,670
I'm Louis Gray from GDL, joined
today with two great

6
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,460
guests from the Google
Chrome team to talk

7
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,670
about Chrome Academy.

8
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,090
It's a brand new event coming
to Google this year.

9
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,690
We're here based in
Mountain View.

10
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,350
So I want to just start it off
by introducing Peter Lubbers

11
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,500
and Allison Roarty.

12
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,570
Thanks for joining me.

13
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,060
ALLISON ROARTY: Thank you.

14
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,690
LOUIS GRAY: Now Chrome Academy
is, as I mentioned, new.

15
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,425
It's the first time we've
ever done this.

16
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:27,290
And it's really taken all of
your time the last week, few

17
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,300
weeks past.

18
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,460
Maybe you can give our viewers
on the live stream an

19
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,370
understanding of what Chrome
Academy is all about.

20
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,250
ALLISON ROARTY: Absolutely.

21
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,510
So Chrome Academy is a week-long
development program

22
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,890
for university students
who are rising

23
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,510
sophomores and juniors.

24
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,740
And we're bringing them here to
Google for a week to teach

25
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,270
them about building web-packaged
Chrome apps.

26
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:48,990
LOUIS GRAY: OK.

27
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,030
PETER LUBBERS: Well, of
course, we're super

28
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,790
excited about it.

29
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,230
It's been a lot of fun
already this week.

30
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,810
But we also want to show you a
little bit of the reactions

31
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,840
from the students themselves.

32
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,320
And we created a little
video for them.

33
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,570
LOUIS GRAY: Cool.

34
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:12,670

35
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,290
JOHN MOORE: I was looking for
internships for this summer

36
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,350
around spring break of this
year, and I saw that Google

37
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,340
had a number of programs that
students, rising sophomores

38
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,510
and juniors, could
be involved in.

39
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,690
I saw Chrome Academy, and it
really caught my attention.

40
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,480
CATHERINE MULLINGS: I did a
summer program last summer

41
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,560
called Google Computer Science
Summer Institute.

42
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,770
And there they really introduce
students to HTML,

43
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,990
JavaScript, App Engine, and
all these resources.

44
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,080
And just being there for three
weeks, I really enjoyed the

45
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,250
culture that everyone brought.

46
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,940
Everyone was so excited to
build new technologies.

47
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,030
And so I just thought I should
be at Google again.

48
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,220
CALVIN CHAN: I believe it all
started with one of the career

49
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,420
fairs at UCLA.

50
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,680
I heard about it, and I went
there to check out a few of

51
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,180
the companies that were trying
to entice students to apply

52
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,900
for opportunities.

53
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,960
And I saw the Google booth and
talked to one the recruiters.

54
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,940
He introduced me to several of
the Google programs, and I was

55
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,970
specially interested in Chrome
Academy because I started

56
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,550
developing websites during
high school.

57
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,980
And it's definitely something
that I'm very interested in.

58
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,110
JONATHAN POON: I'll just
go ahead and apply.

59
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,470
And then luckily, I got in.

60
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,960
So I was really excited to
be part of this program.

61
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,875
CARA KESSLER: I would say that
my favorite part of the Chrome

62
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,972
Academy experience so far has
been the instructors that I've

63
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:31,460
met and that I've gotten
to speak with

64
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,350
on a personal level.

65
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,310
Before we came to Chrome
Academy, we were encouraged to

66
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,730
brush up on our skills
a little online.

67
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,730
So I did the Chrome
DevTools school.

68
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,870
And when I clicked on the
introduction video, there was

69
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,510
Paul Irish explaining how great
Chrome DevTools are.

70
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,170
And then three days later, I'm
at Google, and there's live

71
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,320
Paul Irish.

72
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,390
CALVIN CHAN: I think one of
the coolest things about

73
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,590
Chrome Academy is that I
personally am interested in

74
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,360
the type of courses that
are being offered here.

75
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,810
JONATHAN POON: I think it's
mainly just all the people

76
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,790
that I've met.

77
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,880
They were all very passionate
about what they're doing,

78
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,250
especially about web
development.

79
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,760
JOHN MOORE: Out of everything,
I like the people that I've

80
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,360
met more than anything else.

81
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,395
CATHERINE MULLINGS: I guess it's
the professors that we

82
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:16,670
bring in and all these big gods
in the industry, and how

83
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,490
they have all these resources
that are coming together, just

84
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,740
putting everything and making
all these connections, and

85
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,810
just feeling the creativity
that comes with that.

86
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,780
It's just really exciting.

87
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,930
CALVIN CHAN: One of the first
things we discussed as a team

88
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,320
is what technologies we
wanted to use and

89
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,730
incorporate in our app.

90
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,559
And we all decided that we
wanted to use stuff that we

91
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,010
learned here at Chrome
Academy.

92
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,220
JOHN MOORE: One idea that we had
was to kind of have some

93
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:48,670
sort of interactive whiteboard
service that could serve as a

94
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,180
learning platform.

95
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,180
CARA KESSLER: And we're
implementing WebSockets, so

96
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,190
all of our information
is live.

97
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,480
And when you take a picture,
you click upload on your

98
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,620
phone, and it's live on the
computer screen waiting for

99
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,530
you when you get back.

100
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,000
JONATHAN POON: In our projects,
we use several HTML5

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,290
technologies, such as
WebSockets, that allow us to

102
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,630
have real-time notifications
between all the users of the

103
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,500
application.

104
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,790
And also, we use getUserMedia
and also for geolocation, so

105
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,080
users can easily take pictures
and upload them to the server

106
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,060
and also know exactly where
they took the pictures.

107
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,840
CALVIN CHAN: So we've
implemented some aspects of

108
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,090
web components and shadow DOMs
using the new Polymer

109
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,830
technology by Google.

110
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,900
CARA KESSLER: So this has
definitely been an

111
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,330
unforgettable week.

112
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,350
There are a lot of things I want
to bring back with me.

113
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,290
I took a course in web
development at school this

114
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,920
year, and I did learn a lot of
cool stuff, but nothing as

115
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,740
exciting and cutting edge
and new as the stuff

116
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,880
I've learned here.

117
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,450
JOHN MOORE: I'd have to say that
it's one thing, I think,

118
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,830
to read about Google and its
company culture and its

119
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:54,870
company's mission online or to
hear about it third-hand,

120
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,390
friend of a friend.

121
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,150
It's a completely different
experience to have come here

122
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:04,150
and seen it first person to,
have experienced it, to have

123
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,090
eaten the food, taken the tours,
talked with the people.

124
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,090
I mean, it was just crazy.

125
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,400
I remember the other day, I
think it was yesterday, one of

126
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,660
the groups was working with
Google Maps on their project.

127
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,910
And they had a question.

128
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,740
And I think it might have been
you, you said, oh, well if you

129
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,530
have a question, we'll just go
get someone from the Google

130
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,730
Maps development team to come
answer your question.

131
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,870
And I was like, wow,
no big deal, right?

132
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,050
Google Maps development team.

133
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,050
CARA KESSLER: I learned HTML5
with the guy who wrote the

134
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,440
book on HTML5.

135
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,360
CALVIN CHAN: One of the most
inspiring talks we've had this

136
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,080
week was from Colt about
performance.

137
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,880
And that really hit me because
on campus, I'm part of online

138
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,980
journalism.

139
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,610
And we focus a lot
on delivering

140
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,890
content that's reliable.

141
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,020
And when he talked about the
fact that users usually leave

142
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,370
a page after three seconds,
that really hit me.

143
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,960
Like, we can definitely increase
our traffic to the

144
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,010
"Daily Bruin," which is the
student journalism at UCLA.

145
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,740
We can increase traffic to the
website just by increasing our

146
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,910
performance and decreasing
our load times.

147
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,200
So I will definitely take what I
learned in that talk back to

148
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,630
campus and try and improve
what we do there.

149
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,140
JONATHAN POON: What I would tell
someone who's thinking of

150
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,660
applying is, just do it.

151
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,130
It's a one in a lifetime
experience, and it's awesome.

152
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,760
JOHN MOORE: So if you're
considering applying to Chrome

153
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,330
Academy, I would encourage you
to, as cliche as it sounds, go

154
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,050
ahead and submit your
application.

155
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,900
Because I think that Google sees
potential in everyone.

156
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,340
CARA KESSLER: I would say
definitely apply.

157
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,740
Don't worry about this only
being a week and it taking

158
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,160
away from your job opportunities
for the rest of

159
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,060
the summer because
this is Google.

160
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,530
And I have a job waiting for me
back home, but I'm taking a

161
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,220
week off because this is
a once in a lifetime

162
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,460
opportunity.

163
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,270
And you will learn more here
than you will possibly in a

164
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,250
semester at your university.

165
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,130
And just go for it, and you'll
be happy in the end.

166
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:10,630

167
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,710
LOUIS GRAY: That was
an excellent video.

168
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,920
It's really good to hear
directly from the students who

169
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,560
have done the work at Code
Academy and hear from them

170
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,600
themselves.

171
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,290
So I appreciate you taking the
time to have their input right

172
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:19,850
into the show.

173
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,040
So thank you very
much for that.

174
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,930
ALLISON ROARTY: Definitely.

175
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,540
LOUIS GRAY: So when I take a
look at Chrome Academy, how

176
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,740
did you come up with
this idea?

177
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,830
This is the first time, so there
had to have been an aha

178
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,240
moment to really get
this started.

179
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,910
ALLISON ROARTY: Yeah.

180
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,810
Well, essentially, there's a lot
of really exciting things

181
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,850
happening in the Chrome world
right now, and here at Google,

182
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,140
we are really passionate about
developing students and

183
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,170
exposing them to new cutting
edge web technologies.

184
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,220
And we figured that Chrome
Academy would be a really

185
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,230
great way to do that.

186
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,160
LOUIS GRAY: And what are they
learning about this week?

187
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,340
Is it open standards?

188
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,530
Is it the web as a platform?

189
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,500
There's really so many different
things we can talk

190
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,380
about with Chrome that we've
talked about on GDL.

191
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:55,870
PETER LUBBERS: Right.

192
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,260
Exactly.

193
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,160
LOUIS GRAY: So what's
going on?

194
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,580
They've got like three
days, right?

195
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,780
PETER LUBBERS: No, it's actually
the whole week.

196
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,550
So the students came
on Sunday night.

197
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,450
They were flown in from all over
the United States, from,

198
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,080
like we said before, the rising
sophomores and juniors,

199
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,640
from colleges everywhere.

200
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,770
And so they came in, did some
fun activities, and they were

201
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,430
shown the campus and the
Google store and lots

202
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,550
of other fun stuff.

203
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,480
And then on Monday, we started
the actual program.

204
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,710
And so the program is actually
made up of sort of three

205
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,630
different components.

206
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,090
The first one would be actually
learning some of the

207
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,780
new technologies.

208
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:36,750
So we're exposing them to things
like the latest web

209
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,940
technologies, latest HTML5,
Polymer, shadow DOM, some of

210
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,070
the new languages like Dart
and lots of other exciting

211
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,250
technology.

212
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,330
Paul Irish was doing
a demonstration of

213
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,340
the developer tools.

214
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,240
But really, the latest and
greatest that people might

215
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,910
have seen at I/O, but
that's about it.

216
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,210
LOUIS GRAY: Now I know it's
been a few years since I

217
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,320
graduated college.

218
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,670
But I don't remember shadow
DOM or any of these things

219
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,300
being part of the
CS curriculum.

220
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,730
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

221
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,690
LOUIS GRAY: How would you say
that Chrome Academy introduces

222
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,070
new concepts to the students?

223
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,190
Are these things that
they're learning in

224
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,720
universities already?

225
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,410
What's being taught and what's
not being taught that we're

226
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,780
kind of filling the gap on?

227
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,680
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah, and I
think that's part of the

228
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,920
program that is the mission
behind the program, is really

229
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,000
to introduce them to the things
that we would like them

230
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,840
to already know that
they're just not

231
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
getting yet in college.

232
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,560
I mean, these things are so new,
to give a little bit of

233
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,110
credit to the universities, they
could not possibly have

234
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,410
curriculum on it because
it just doesn't exist.

235
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,610
But here, we can iterate on
that curriculum very fast.

236
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,200
And we've just built a two-hour
code lab on using web

237
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,660
components in Polymer that
literally was done for the

238
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,430
very first time by the
students here.

239
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,280
So it's pretty exciting.

240
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,130
They really get to hear from
the people developing the

241
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,280
specifications, the people that
are writing the code, and

242
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,230
the things that are just
barely checked in.

243
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,740
So it couldn't possibly
be in any other sort

244
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,795
of curriculum yet.

245
00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:01,470
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

246
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,830
Some of the newness, I think
it actually presents a real

247
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,040
opportunity.

248
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,020
When you write for the web,
you have that kind of open

249
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,730
standard where you know you
can write it once, and it

250
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,120
really runs on any platform.

251
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,330
And in the last few decades,
you've seen this transition

252
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,300
away from software-based
platforms, where you write

253
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,020
once, and it works on a specific
operating system.

254
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,715
Are students really grokking
that idea and that idea of

255
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:24,410
that portability, and seeing
the opportunity there?

256
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,360
PETER LUBBERS: I think
more and more.

257
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,650
One of the interesting things
that I've found is in the

258
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,110
past, I've done a lot of
training in HTML5.

259
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,040
And we would refer to how it was
bad in the past and then

260
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,460
give an example of, well, how
the HTML5 technologies would

261
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,500
make it better.

262
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,290
But what's interesting with
these students, they've never

263
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,020
really seen those old,
bad ways of doing.

264
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,050
So they're actually starting
out fresh.

265
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,300
And it's great to start with
some of the newer technologies

266
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,950
that are abstracting a lot
of these problems.

267
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,490
And basically, it's a much
better experience when you

268
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,450
don't have to think of all
the things in the past.

269
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,320
LOUIS GRAY: It's kind of like
you say, the best way to stop

270
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,970
a bad habit is to never get
it in the first place.

271
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,210
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

272
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,790
LOUIS GRAY: And so they're
starting exceptionally clean.

273
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,750
It's a very interesting
concept.

274
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,260
PETER LUBBERS: And I think
actually even better here

275
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,420
than, let's say, starting the
bad habits back with a

276
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,015
two-year-old curriculum.

277
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:16,905
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

278
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:19,430
Now, the Chrome Academy
students themselves.

279
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,850
Is this for engineers only?

280
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,960
Is it for sophomores
and juniors only?

281
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,680
What's the criteria to get in?

282
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,830
How did we find these people
in the first place?

283
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,010
ALLISON ROARTY: So right now,
it is only for rising

284
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,210
sophomores and juniors.

285
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:32,830
PETER LUBBERS: In college.

286
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,260
ALLISON ROARTY: In
college, yes.

287
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,200
And we generally target students
who are computer

288
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,110
science majors.

289
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,920
But for Chrome Academy in
particular, we look for

290
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,780
students that were strong in
HTML and JavaScript and CSS.

291
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,050
So really, anyone who has those
skills, regardless of

292
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,630
their major, could apply and be

293
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,180
considered for this program.

294
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,030
LOUIS GRAY: The Google hiring
process for full-time jobs has

295
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,890
traditionally been exceptionally
challenging.

296
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,740
We get written up on
it all the time.

297
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,830
And we know that's a great way
and a great threshold to get

298
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,220
exceptional people to
join the company.

299
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,440
What kind of recruiting process
and what kind of

300
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,420
application process do the
students have to do?

301
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,380
Did they have to write code in
advance or say that they've

302
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,810
learned specific skills?

303
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,319
ALLISON ROARTY: For Chrome
Academy, we ask for their

304
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,349
resume and transcript.

305
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,560
So we're interested in what
college courses they've taken

306
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,339
already and how they've
been doing there.

307
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,194
We did ask them three essay
questions, short essays.

308
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:22,327
PETER LUBBERS: That
was my idea.

309
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:25,349
ALLISON ROARTY: And we also ask
for a link to GitHub or

310
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,319
wherever they're housing any
work so that we can look at

311
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,770
work that they've
already done.

312
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,400
LOUIS GRAY: And I assume a lot
of the students probably don't

313
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,830
want to leave Google now
that they're here.

314
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,730
PETER LUBBERS: That's true.

315
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,880
LOUIS GRAY: And so how have
we thought about that?

316
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,790
How do you get these sophomore
and junior students who need

317
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,790
to go back and complete
their degree?

318
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,880
Is this something where they
have a fast track into a

319
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,260
Google internship program?

320
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,990
What's the end goal there?

321
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,740
ALLISON ROARTY: Yeah,
definitely.

322
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,200
And that's what we've
incorporated career

323
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,170
development components to Chrome
Academy as well, so the

324
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:55,430
students have career panels
where we brought in not only

325
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,810
junior and senior Googlers but
interns as well, who they had

326
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,090
the opportunity to then ask
them questions about the

327
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,100
interview process, what's an
internship like, what do you

328
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,410
wish you knew when you
were in my position.

329
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,540
We also are doing mock interview
sessions with them

330
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,400
so that they can go through an
actual real Google technical

331
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,640
interview and get a sneak peek
into what that's like, what we

332
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,830
look for, so that they
have a better

333
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,910
idea for how to prepare.

334
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,810
And we're hoping that all 29
students will apply for an

335
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,560
internship with Google
this fall.

336
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,880
That's definitely our goal.

337
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,940
LOUIS GRAY: The internship's
coming up a lot this summer

338
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,131
for some reason.

339
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:31,890
But I'm hoping we're
able to get back to

340
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,680
how it really works.

341
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,520
ALLISON ROARTY: The real
internship, yes.

342
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,050
LOUIS GRAY: See the movie.

343
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,900
It's fun.

344
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,250
But there are some
differences, as I

345
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,060
always like to say.

346
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,523
PETER LUBBERS: We
do have pudding.

347
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:40,706
ALLISON ROARTY: That
might be the only

348
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:41,548
thing that is the same.

349
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:43,340
LOUIS GRAY: And the
food is free.

350
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,480
But there's other development
programs for students beyond

351
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,940
Chrome Academy.

352
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,375
Can you explain what
those are?

353
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:48,810
ALLISON ROARTY: Sure.

354
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,730
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah, there's one
that's pretty exciting for

355
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,320
high school students.

356
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,560
For seniors in high school,
there is the Computer Science

357
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,990
Summer institute, CSSI.

358
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,800
So that's a great way.

359
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,275
And in fact, a lot
of the students--

360
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:02,270
I'm not sure of the
exact breakdown--

361
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,620
that are in Chrome Academy
were previously in CSSI.

362
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,370
So it's a great track.

363
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,560
That's a three week program
where, again, they get flown

364
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,410
to Google and have the whole
Google experience, but also

365
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,610
very code-heavy.

366
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,440
And one thing I didn't mention
earlier was we're not just

367
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,540
lecturing them on
technologies.

368
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,600
That would be boring.

369
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,080
I mean, it would be exciting,
but hours

370
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,710
and hours of lecture.

371
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,970
It's--

372
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,682
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah, you've
got to spice it

373
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:31,700
up with some variety.

374
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,360
PETER LUBBERS: So we've
actually, right from the

375
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,490
start, divided them
up in teams.

376
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,090
And they were free to pick
whatever project they wanted

377
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:40,660
to work on.

378
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,760
But they have to--

379
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,400
and this is by tomorrow, by
the end of the week--

380
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,790
come up with a complete
web application.

381
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,930
So they're building that.

382
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,060
And so the first couple days
were pretty lecture-rich, so

383
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,420
they got see, oh, these
are great frameworks.

384
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,450
I can use them.

385
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,470
These are technologies
I want to use.

386
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,610
They made up their mind, and now
they're building, and now

387
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,200
it's much more code-heavy.

388
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,260
So we're bringing in experts
to help them when they have

389
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,110
questions about various parts
of their project.

390
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,580
But tomorrow, it'll be
judging the projects.

391
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,130
And, of course, the winners
can get some prizes.

392
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,070
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah, how do
you decide who wins?

393
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,020
I don't want to give
it away if they

394
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,080
haven't finished their--

395
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,180
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

396
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,880
PETER LUBBERS: Oh
no, they know.

397
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,450
ALLISON ROARTY: They know
what we're looking for.

398
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:20,940
PETER LUBBERS: It's a rubric.

399
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,330
LOUIS GRAY: Is it just avoidance
of crash or number

400
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:23,680
of installs?

401
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,150
PETER LUBBERS: Well, that's
a baseline, yeah.

402
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:31,220
So there are five categories:
look and feel, creativity, how

403
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,160
useful it is, how
mobile-friendly it is.

404
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,240
Of course, that's one
of our key things.

405
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,220
So all of these categories, you
can get four points, and

406
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,130
the winner will be scoring
across the board.

407
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,600
And they're already building
some incredible applications.

408
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,190
One of them is using WebSockets
and canvas to build

409
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,890
a whiteboarding solution
for in the class.

410
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:57,385
So that could enhance, for
example, a Udacity course that

411
00:20:57,385 --> 00:21:02,500
they might be taking, or an
in-class lesson that they're

412
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,445
doing, where they can
collaborate with their teacher

413
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:08,530
or other kids out of--

414
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,900
WebRTC is used in another one.

415
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,400
Another one's doing a great
scavenger hunt game.

416
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,030
And from what I've seen so far,

417
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,520
I've been super impressed.

418
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,630
LOUIS GRAY: You're not tipping
your hand on your

419
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,430
favorites, are you?

420
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,680
PETER LUBBERS: No, no, no.

421
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,780
It's wide open.

422
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,770
ALLISON ROARTY: And with all of
our programs, just like at

423
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,680
Google, we're launch
and iterate.

424
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,350
We're very focused
on building.

425
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,630
And we want our programs
to be the same way.

426
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,150
So these programs are in
no way theoretical.

427
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,410
Like Peter said, we're
not just lecturing.

428
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,470
We're not just telling them
about these technologies.

429
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,640
We're challenging them to build
something in a week with

430
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,070
a technology that they've
never seen before.

431
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,380
And that's what we
do across all of

432
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,190
our development programs.

433
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,940
PETER LUBBERS: And the resources
that are available--

434
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,930
this was also mentioned by one
of the kids in the video--

435
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,230
there's when that
had a question

436
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,010
about Google+ Sign-In.

437
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,510
They wanted to add
it to their page.

438
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,140
We literally just walked
upstairs, grabbed someone--

439
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,370
here, come and help.

440
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,090
And Chris Cartland came out
and instantly helped them.

441
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,910
Then he got on the bus
and went home.

442
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,690
LOUIS GRAY: That's one
exceptional thing I enjoy,

443
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,670
especially being at Google
on Developer Relations.

444
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,520
We have the access to people
on every single team.

445
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,192
And so if you want to reach
somebody from Google+, you

446
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:15,940
know who they are.

447
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,495
You know how to reach them
from Chrome and Android.

448
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:20,240
And it's a really exceptional
network within what we call a

449
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,990
medium-sized company
here at Google.

450
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,140
And I've already seen a lot of
people really interested in

451
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,740
the next Chrome Academy.

452
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,370
Like, when is the next
one happening?

453
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,110
Maybe there's already
ideas for changes,

454
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,780
how to make it better.

455
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,650
Is it going to be bigger?

456
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,380
Zach from Sacramento was
asking about the

457
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,240
dates for next year.

458
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,030
Maybe we can tell him.

459
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,980
ALLISON ROARTY: We don't
have the dates for

460
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,390
next year quite yet.

461
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,580
I would say for anyone who's
interested, check the Google

462
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,680
Students site,
google.com/students.

463
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,010
And that information should
be available around

464
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,490
the end of the year.

465
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,760
LOUIS GRAY: And one
more question came

466
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,160
through Google Moderator.

467
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,790
What about the seniors?

468
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,600
Why sophomores and juniors?

469
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,830
PETER LUBBERS: Well, we
want the seniors to

470
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,580
already be our interns.

471
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,010
LOUIS GRAY: So they should
already be here.

472
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:08,350
PETER LUBBERS: They should be
there in another capacity.

473
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,950
LOUIS GRAY: But where can
people find out more

474
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,970
information about Chrome
Academy online?

475
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,420
PETER LUBBERS: So that's
on your students site.

476
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,640
ALLISON ROARTY: Yep.

477
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,770
So google.com/students has more
information about Chrome

478
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,060
Academy, Android camp, Computer
Science Summer

479
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,000
institute, and the rest of our
fabulous internship and

480
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,960
development program
opportunities.

481
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,260
PETER LUBBERS: And for people
that are listening and

482
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,100
watching that want to get
it, that are interested,

483
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:36,100
obviously, one of the things,
the application wasn't just

484
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,755
your resume.

485
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:40,790
It was also an essay about
why you want to come.

486
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,120
Also, links to your GitHub
repository, if you have one.

487
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,680
And those things tend to
weigh pretty heavy.

488
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,310
There's also a letter
of recommendation.

489
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:53,455
So already, if you're thinking
about it, try to have some of

490
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:56,550
those things in mind that you
can work towards it, not at

491
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,340
the last minute have to
pull that together.

492
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,820
And start doing some of
our online course.

493
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,610
So, of course, we're
on GDL right now.

494
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,070
But this is also where you would
come to find information

495
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,290
about all of the stuff we're
doing in Chrome, Chrome

496
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,590
packaged app series and mobile
and we've got the break point

497
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,960
with Paul Irish and Addy Osmani
talking about all of

498
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,730
the great things you can do.

499
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,440
So get familiar with the
technology I would say this is

500
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,580
very important.

501
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,850
And we definitely look at people
that have not just an

502
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,930
interest, but have actually
experimented with it.

503
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,750
LOUIS GRAY: When you talk about
the resources there, one

504
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,970
thing that really comes to
mind, besides all of the

505
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,780
Google Developers Live videos
we're doing, but also things

506
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,290
like web platform docs,
the Udacity courses.

507
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,660
I think one thing that's
interesting about Google, it's

508
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,580
about finding the information
and making it available and

509
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,560
accessible.

510
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,180
And you look at exactly what
we're doing here with Chrome

511
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,070
Academy, that you can come in
fully loaded, knowing all

512
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,760
about each one of these
standards, knowing about how

513
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,350
they interact with the web
platform and how to make your

514
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,940
own custom applications.

515
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,410
So I want to say thank you very
much, Allison and Peter,

516
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,120

to put together Chrome

517
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,350
Academy, but to take the
exceptional time to join us
