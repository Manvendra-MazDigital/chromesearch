00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,860

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,180
DAVID TSENG: Hi everyone,
my name is David Tseng.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,690
I am a software engineer
on the accessibility

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,090
team here at Google.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,070
And I have here with me my
colleague, Volker Sorge, who

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,470
is a visiting professor from the
University of Birmingham.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,210
We're here today to talk to you
about ChromeVox, and some

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,920
of the exciting work we've been
doing to make reading of

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,610
mathematics on the
web possible.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,430
To tell you more about this,
I'm going to hand it off to

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,770
Volker for a brief introduction
to the work.

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,910
And I'll then come back for
a brief introduction to

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,040
ChromeVox, in general.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,860
Volker.

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,180
VOLKER SORGE: Thank
you, David.

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,200
So my name is Volker Sorge.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,130
I'm a senior lecturer
at the University of

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,830
Birmingham in the UK.

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,940
And I've been spending the last
year, together with the

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,650
ChromeVox team here, to make
an effort in order to make

21
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,519
scientific material that's out
of the web accessible for

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,480
people with visual
impairments.

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,590
And first, we have concentrated
on making

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,170
mathematics accessible,
using ChromeVox.

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,830
Now why is that important?

26
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:23,400
Well, one of the problems with
scientific material is that it

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,180
is a hurdle in education that
many people that have visual

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,340
independents are excluded from
having scientific material

29
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,640
readily available as their
normal peers would have.

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,840
Because it is much harder to
make scientific material fully

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,510
accessible.

32
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,290
And particularly, if you think
about something like

33
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,450
mathematics, it is not as
straightforward as reading

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,920
just regular texts.

35
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,430
Therefore, it is often very
difficult to make it

36
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,860
accessible using your average
screen reader.

37
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,620
Now there have been a number of
efforts in order to make,

38
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,120
in particular, mathematics
accessible,

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,790
that are on the web.

40
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,480
But these are generally efforts
that require either

41
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,139
particular, special tools or
particular plug-ins for

42
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,560
special browsers.

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,680
So what we have been trying to
do with ChromeVox is make

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,590
mathematics accessible in just
the standard screen reader--

45
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,930
so making, effectively,
mathematics a first class

46
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,400
citizen in the world
of accessibility.

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,950
And we have done, also, in
addition, some special

48
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,480
elements, like, in particular,
exploration of mathematics,

49
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,850
that we believe are fairly
novel, and that we're going to

50
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:45,180
demonstrate to you in
the upcoming hour.

51
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,650
So first, we'll start with a
general introduction to what

52
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,340
ChromeVox actually is, before we
then go into more detail on

53
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,290
how one can use it to speak
mathematics, and also, how one

54
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,170
can, in particular, use it to
customize how mathematics is

55
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,430
being spoke.

56
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,312
And for the general
introduction, that's going to

57
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:02,590
be done by David.

58
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,510
David, please.

59
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,320
DAVID TSENG: Thank
you, Volker.

60
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:11,200
So just to get everybody up to
speed and on the same page,

61
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,520
I'm going to give a demo of
ChromeVox, and its general

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,120
features and functionality as
a general screen reader.

63
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,270
So for the past, I'd say, three
or so years, we've been

64
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,670
developing ChromeVox.

65
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,500
And ChromeVox is just
a Chrome extension.

66
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,290
So it's all written
in JavaScript.

67
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,880
And we have access to all the
information that any other web

68
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,770
page would.

69
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:38,700
And this gives us a lot of
things that ordinary screen

70
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,340
readers don't get, and
everything that they do get.

71
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,350
So we've been able to create
something that, I think, is

72
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,070
fully featured, and allows
a blind user to

73
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,950
navigate all of the web.

74
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,280
So to start off with, I will
show everyone a standard page

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,470
from Wikipedia.

76
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,010
This is a square root.

77
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,700
The topic for this page
is on square roots.

78
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,050
And I will start off by simply
tabbing around, and letting

79
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,430
everyone hear the type of
feedback we provide.

80
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,350
CHROMEVOX: Navigation--

81
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,900
internal link.

82
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,230
This page has one alert.

83
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,019
Do you want Google Chrome
to save your password?

84
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,660
DAVID TSENG: So there, you've
heard quite a few things.

85
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,610
So it says a lot.

86
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,750
It says, first of all-- the
first thing that you've heard

87
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,550
was "navigation" and "link--"
"internal link." So those bits

88
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,430
of information are contextual.

89
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,910
And it tells you what the
currently focused item is.

90
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,450
So a user who's using a screen
reader can then know how to

91
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,820
interact with this.

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,970
So since it's a link, one can
press it, and therefore land

93
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,670
in another place on this page,
since it's an internal link.

94
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,930
And the second bit of feedback
you heard was an alert given

95
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,790
by the Chrome browser.

96
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,070
So we actually speak
that, as well.

97
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,370
So besides landing on focusable
items, we can

98
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,210
actually move about the
page and move to

99
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,120
things that aren't focusable.

100
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,470
So you do that by pressing the
ChromeVox modifiers, and the

101
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,120
arrow keys.

102
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,117
So let's hear what
that sounds like.

103
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:22,340
CHROMEVOX: Comma.

104
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,980
Search--

105
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,640
internal link.

106
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,780
Quote square roots quote
redirects here.

107
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,290
For the music festival,
see square roots--

108
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,265
link.

109
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,630
DAVID TSENG: And you
hear quite a few

110
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,625
other things there.

111
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,820
There were some static
pieces of text.

112
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,380
There were some more links.

113
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,130
And one other item that is kind
of interesting to point

114
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,180
out is-- you heard a sound
effect, kind of

115
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,930
like a "ding" sound.

116
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,470
And that actually represents
a link.

117
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,610
So whatever a user hears that,
they automatically know that

118
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,110
they can click on it.

119
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,170
So some other interesting things
are that a user doesn't

120
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,590
necessarily have to
go item by item.

121
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,830
They can actually jump from
section to section.

122
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,320
And that's done via another
keyboard command.

123
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,190
And let's hear what
that sounds like.

124
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,910
CHROMEVOX: Contents--

125
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,580
heading two.

126
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,020
DAVID TSENG: So there, I just
skipped a lot of material on

127
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,230
the page, and was able to jump
right to the contents listing.

128
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,860
So let's try that again, and see
if we find anything else

129
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,690
interesting.

130
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,730
CHROMEVOX: Properties--

131
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,048
heading two.

132
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:32,160
DAVID TSENG: All right,
and keep on going.

133
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,850
CHROMEVOX: Left bracket,
edit source-- link--

134
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,480
pipe, edit, beta,
right bracket--

135
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,410
link.

136
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,100
Enlarge the graph of the
function f left parenthesis x

137
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,010
right parenthesis equals square
root of x-- math.

138
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,330
DAVID TSENG: And there, we have
something that alludes to

139
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,330
the rest of the talk.

140
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,780
And it's how we actually make
it possible to read that

141
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,130
expression, and make it possible
for ChromeVox, and

142
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,150
the user, to then communicate,
using something that's a

143
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,710
little bit richer and a little
bit more unique.

144
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:15,250
So with that, one last thing
to show is we can actually

145
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,800
read content, continuously,
just by

146
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,350
pressing another command.

147
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,370
And it'll actually read it kind
of like a book, from this

148
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,690
point on to whenever you
want to stop it.

149
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,630
CHROMEVOX: Made up of
half a parabola--

150
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,130
link-- with a vertical
directrix--

151
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,120
link-- dot.

152
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,540
The principal square root
function f left parenthesis x

153
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,850
right parenthesis equals square
root of x-- math--

154
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,970
usually just referred to as the
quote square root function

155
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,210
quote, is a function.

156
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,480
DAVID TSENG: And I'll
just stop it there.

157
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,550
And that, overall, gives you a
flavor of what ChromeVox is,

158
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,920
and what it does, and how the
user would use it, and a

159
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,170
little bit of a taste of how
math works, and spoken math

160
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,330
sounds like.

161
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,110
So with that, I will throw
it back to Volker.

162
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,380
And he will continue on with
some of the more interesting

163
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,060
things that we're doing
with math, and

164
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,646
how this is all possible.

165
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:12,720
VOLKER SORGE: Thank
you, David.

166
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,880
So as you could already hear
when David was demonstration

167
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,500
the continuous reader on the
previous paragraph, there was

168
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,070
math contained in
the paragraph.

169
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,830
And the math was just being
spoken out in a

170
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,950
fairly verbose way.

171
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,010
We'll talk about that a bit
later, why this is so verbose.

172
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:39,480
And in order to explain how that
is being spoken out, it

173
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,860
is probably worthwhile going a
bit into detail on how math is

174
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,810
actually represented
on the web.

175
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,600
And in particular, for those
who are not fully aware how

176
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,160
math on webpages works, or
should work, I'll give a quick

177
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,930
introduction on that now.

178
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,170
So ideally, mathematics on the
web is represented by a

179
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,630
special markup language
called MathML.

180
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,100
MathML has been around
for some time.

181
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,060
And it has evolved and matured
to a degree that it's now been

182
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,240
made a stand for HTML5,
and as a consequence,

183
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,950
also for EPUB 3.

184
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,290
So in other words, every EPUB
3 reader, in the future,

185
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,830
should also be able to
deal with MathML.

186
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,480
Now the question, of course,
arises, why is there a

187
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,060
specialist markup language
just for mathematics.

188
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,790
Well, the reason is that
mathematics is fairly

189
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,390
involved, in terms of the way
expressions are being set up

190
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,680
and how they're being
structured, which is normally

191
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,460
not doable--

192
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,180
or not easily doable--

193
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,465
with just regular HTML.

194
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:47,110
In particular, think about that
regular HTML is very good

195
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,530
with dealing with text
and these things.

196
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,310
It can also do sub
and superscript.

197
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,980
However as soon as things become
more involved, as in a

198
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,210
mathematics expression--

199
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,260
which is, by nature, effectively
two dimensional

200
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,170
and very, very nested--

201
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,520
HTML alone can normally
not deal with it.

202
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,700
Therefore, MathML provides all
the basic functionality--

203
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,600
or the basic tags--

204
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,430
in order to create complex
mathematics expressions, and

205
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,130
display them on the web.

206
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:27,470
Now while it is, in general,
a good thing that MathML is

207
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,190
fairly mature, and that it's a
part of standards, what is a

208
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,390
drawback about MathML is that
it is not implemented in all

209
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,570
browsers, or all
EPUB 3 readers.

210
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,360
As a consequence, there are
several ways of getting

211
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,060
mathematics on the web
to work nevertheless.

212
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:53,180
So one of the ways it is done
by many sites, such as

213
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:59,140
Wikipedia, by default, as well
as other pages, is that one

214
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,950
actually displays an image of
the mathematics instead of

215
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,530
having a MathML expression
in there.

216
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,760
And therefore, it can be easily
read by people who can

217
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,870
actually see the image.

218
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,240
But it cannot necessarily be
picked up by a screen reader.

219
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,820
Now the advantage of this is,
sometimes, that the real

220
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,550
mathematics is still provided
somewhere in the background,

221
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,620
not visible.

222
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,710
And therefore, it can indeed
be used by screen reader.

223
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,730
And I'll demonstrate it to you
later, how that is being done.

224
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,110
The other way of displaying
mathematics on all browsers on

225
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,260
all platforms is by using a
little library called MathJax,

226
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,960
which is done by the
MathJax Consortium.

227
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,000
And if you want to check this
out, this is at mathjax.org.

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,110
And the way this works is that
MathJax can be injected in any

229
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,135
page that contents
mathematics.

230
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:56,840
And it's JavaScript.

231
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,870
And it just renders the
mathematics, which is either

232
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,510
given as MathML or a more
traditional markup language

233
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,960
like LaTeX or ASCIIMath.

234
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,970
And it then renders
the mathematics.

235
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,940
Now the challenge with this
process, for a screen reader

236
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,850
who actually wants to use the
mathematics in order to speak

237
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,180
it, is that we actually have to
deal with all these types

238
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,800
of mathematics as
they can occur.

239
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,660
So we have to be able to deal
with just standard MathML

240
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,460
expressions as well as
expressions rendered by

241
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,100
MathJax, or expressions that are
just hidden somewhere, in

242
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,760
an alternative text,
behind the image.

243
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,900
And I'll show you,
now, how that

244
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,765
actually works, in practice.

245
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:41,040
Right, so let me just quickly
demonstrate how this is then

246
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,220
spoken by ChromeVox.

247
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,040
So let's go to the first
math expression,

248
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,325
again, in this paragraph.

249
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:50,062

250
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:54,560
CHROMEVOX: f left parenthesis
x right parenthesis equals

251
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,300
square root of x--

252
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,090
math.

253
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,860
VOLKER SORGE: As you can see,
the first maths expression

254
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,100
here, in the DOM, is actually
the math expression which is

255
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,650
in the caption of this
particular image.

256
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,120
But it still spoke it.

257
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,420
And it went to it.

258
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,380
And you can see it's been
indicated by this highlighter,

259
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,110
which is, for instance,
particularly helpful if you

260
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,033
need to see where you are in the
text-- so for instance, if

261
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,105
you are dyslexic.

262
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:25,320
And for dyslexic students,
this is useful.

263
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,650
And we'll just go to the next
maths expression, which should

264
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,164
now be this one in
the paragraph.

265
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:32,060
CHROMEVOX: --left parenthesis
x right parenthesis equals

266
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,190
square root of x-- math.

267
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,420
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

268
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,080
Now as I said, this works,
now, nicely.

269
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,880
Because I'm actually logged
into Wikipedia.

270
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,720
And if I were to now log out of
the Wikipedia page, I then

271
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,660
would get it just as an image.

272
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,380
And it would still work.

273
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,090
Because we can use the
alternative text, which is in

274
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,150
the background, which is
actually the LaTeX expression

275
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,040
which you saw of the
beginning before

276
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,570
the MathJax was rendering.

277
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,030
Now I'm not going to log out
of this Wikipedia page,

278
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,410
because we will need it later.

279
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,210
However, let's go to a different
page, where we have

280
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,000
a similar effect.

281
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,870
CHROMEVOX: Sum from
Wolfram Math.

282
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,850
VOLKER SORGE: And this is
Mathworld, which is a

283
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,920
particular encyclopedia,
just for mathematics.

284
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,000
And what happens there is that
you have the mathematics given

285
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,210
as an image only, always.

286
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,190
However, you also have
alternative text.

287
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,090
And in that case,
it's ASCIIMath.

288
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,900
And we can leverage this
ASCIIMath in order to

289
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,990
pronounce it.

290
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,110
And just to show you that the
math expressions here are

291
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:41,700
indeed images, I'll just
grab it quickly, and

292
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,800
I'll move them around.

293
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,160
See, this is an image.

294
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,860
And I can take this sum, and
just move it around on the

295
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,110
screen here.

296
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,880
And all these are images.

297
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,870
CHROMEVOX: A sum is the
result of an addition.

298
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,670
For example, adding 1, 2, 3,
and 4 gives the sum 10,

299
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:04,840
written 1 plus 2 plus
3 plus 4 equals 10.

300
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,640
Full stop.

301
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,170
Math.

302
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,680
VOLKER SORGE: So you could
hear, now, that this is,

303
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,230
indeed, a math expression.

304
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,230
Although it was an image, it's
being fully pronounced because

305
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,860
we can leverage the
alternative text.

306
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,080
And you could hear, also, why
it was a math expression,

307
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,990
because it was specially
announced using an earcon as

308
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,170
well as, in the end, an
announcement that this is a

309
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,000
math expression.

310
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,350
Similarly, we can go to the
next math expression, for

311
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,270
instance, and--

312
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:38,590
CHROMEVOX: k equals 1 under and
4 over n-ary summation.

313
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,250
k equals 10-- full
stop-- math.

314
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,290
VOLKER SORGE: So again, this
is the maths expression how

315
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,860
it's being spoken
at the moment.

316
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:52,210
And this now gives us the
possibility to have math

317
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,750
spoken where it's on Wikipedia,
even without

318
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,710
logging in, as well as on
MathWorld, as well as on many

319
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,670
other sites where there's
a similar effect.

320
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,800
So for instance, there's many
math blocks out there.

321
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,420
So one of the block so I'm going
to demonstrate here is a

322
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,380
famous block from a famous
mathematician, Terry Tao, who

323
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,580
is a Fields medalist winner.

324
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:18,130
And he regularly blogs on his
latest mathematical research.

325
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,450
And he does it in a similar vein
to what we've just seen

326
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,170
on the MathWorld site, that the
mathematics is actually

327
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,390
given in images.

328
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,630
And I'll grab one of those
images here, and move it

329
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,520
around, so you can see that
this is an image.

330
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,640
So this is an image.

331
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,120
Here's another one.

332
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,550
But the alternative text in the

333
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,510
background is indeed LaTeX.

334
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,790
And therefore, we can actually
speak it, using ChromeVox.

335
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,260
So let's just speak this first
definition, for instance.

336
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,580
CHROMEVOX: Definition one--
multiple dense divisibility--

337
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,090
let y greater than or
equal to 1-- math.

338
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,140
For each natural number k
greater than or equal to 0--

339
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,680
math--

340
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,800
we define a notion of k--

341
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,320
math--

342
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,780
tuply y--

343
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,470
math--

344
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,099
dense divisibility recursively,
as follows--

345
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,609
list with two items--

346
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,690
every natural number-- list
item-- n-- math--

347
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,750
is 0--

348
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,290
math--

349
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,760
tuply y--

350
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,670
math--

351
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,500
densely divisible.

352
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,770
If-- list item--

353
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,732
k greater than or equal
to 1-- math-- and--

354
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:21,730
VOLKER SORGE: Right,
I'll stop it here.

355
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,060
So what you could hear was
that all the math in the

356
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,640
paragraph has been spoken.

357
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,230
Although it's as images, we used
the alternative texts in

358
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,590
order to translate it with
the MathJax library.

359
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,920
It's the same library we saw,
previously, rendering the math

360
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,680
on the Wikipedia page.

361
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,210
When it comes back from the
MathJax rendering, we can then

362
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:51,190
use this representation
in order to speak it.

363
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,970
And however we do this in the
background, in that sense,

364
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,890
none of the content
in the page is

365
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,650
actually, physically changed.

366
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,580
So it still has the same visual
appearance as before.

367
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,450
What you could also hear, when
we were speaking the maths, is

368
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,810
that it was always giving a
little earcon, and the math

369
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,870
announcement, which gives you
the possibility to actually

370
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,570
find out where the math is.

371
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:18,110
And this is, in particular,
important if you want to have

372
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,230
more interaction
with the math.

373
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,960
And with this, I'll pass back
to David, who's now going to

374
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,420
explain to you one of the
specialities of ChromeVox

375
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,950
which allows you to actually
interactively explore a

376
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,720
mathematics expression, which we
believe is a very important

377
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,060
step in order for people to
fully engage with mathematical

378
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,910
content that's on the web.

379
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,310
DAVID TSENG: I think everybody
can identify with me,

380
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,990
personally, in that hearing all
of this is kind of a lot

381
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,710
to take in.

382
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,890
I mean, if you consider the
often quoted figure of 7 plus

383
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,840
or minus 2 bits of information
that we, as humans, can store

384
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,110
and keep in our short term
memory, what we just heard was

385
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,820
way more than seven words.

386
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,040
So what do we do about that?

387
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:12,220
Well, speaking personally, I, in
the days when I was in high

388
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,150
school and in university, used
several methods to actually

389
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,550
access mathematics.

390
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,000
One primary way, and one that's
pretty popular still,

391
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,890
is to use audio books.

392
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,320
And at the time, we actually
used these four-track audio

393
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,980
tapes-- so a tape which has two
sides, using both stereo

394
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,030
channels, splitting those into
mono, and having each channel

395
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,980
record audio tracks.

396
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,315
And someone--

397
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:43,570
a really, really nice
volunteer--

398
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,870
would sit down in a room
and read through

399
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,680
an entire math textbook.

400
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,330
So this included anything from
algebra all the way up to

401
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,770
calculus and even beyond.

402
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,180
I remember listening to a real
analysis book in college,

403
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:03,430
which was once in a lifetime
experience.

404
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,700
So it was really, really
difficult.

405
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,170
And there was a lot of
rewinding, and pausing, and

406
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,050
taking notes.

407
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,660
So we feel like ChromeVox can do
a lot better, since we have

408
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:23,700
a computer, and we have the
ability to write code to make

409
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,130
things easier.

410
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,910
So what have we done, exactly?

411
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,940
Well, think about
any expression--

412
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,230
and I'll demo this,
briefly, later on.

413
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,460
But just think about something
that you've seen in the past,

414
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,500
say, the quadratic formula.

415
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,630
How would you actually
read that?

416
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,460
It's not exactly obvious.

417
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:52,780
And even harder is then to tell
a person who's never seen

418
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,090
it before where all
the pieces lie.

419
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,260
So if you think of it
like geography--

420
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,700
where are all the countries?

421
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,570
And where are all the
large pieces?

422
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,630
Where are all the continents?

423
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,240
And if you want to dive in to
a specific region, well,

424
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,430
what's inside there?

425
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,550
And how do you actually give
a quick summary of

426
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,160
all of these things?

427
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,380
And how do you actually let
a person then ask you to

428
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,460
describe something further?

429
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,750
So this is the challenge that
ChromeVox has faced.

430
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,170
And we feel like we've come up
with a pretty good solution.

431
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,040
So let me go ahead and just
demo that for you now.

432
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,980
We can hear how does it now.

433
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,020
And I can show you how a person
would actually explore

434
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,940
the various pieces of it.

435
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,150
CHROMEVOX: We have x equals
minus b plus/minus square root

436
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:50,080
of b square minus 4ac
divided by 2a--

437
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,800
math.

438
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,120
DAVID TSENG: Now you
see immediately

439
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,080
notice quite a few things.

440
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,710
There were a lot of words,
for one thing.

441
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,610
We also slowed down the speech
rate quite a bit so that we

442
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,200
can do some more intelligent
things like speeding up

443
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,260
certain parts, slowing down
others, inserting pauses,

444
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,340
changing pitch.

445
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,330
So one thing to add there is,
you'll notice a little bit of

446
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,180
pitch drift.

447
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,810
So all the stuff in the
numerator, you'll hear go up a

448
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,350
little bit.

449
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,480
All the stuff in the
denominator, you'll hear go

450
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,720
down a little bit.

451
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,770
In that power, the b squared,
the squared part is actually

452
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,070
up a little bit, even
more, in pitch.

453
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,740
So it gives you another
dimension to work with.

454
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:40,720
So pitch gives me, as someone
who is the listener, an

455
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,510
additional hint as to how high
something, or low something,

456
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,870
is vertically represented.

457
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,680
But this is still a pretty
beefy example.

458
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,280
If you remember your first
algebra class, it's a lot to

459
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,020
take in for someone
who is seeing this

460
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,360
for the first time.

461
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,350
So how do we actually let
someone explore it?

462
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,880
Well, we have one of these other
ChromeVox commands that

463
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,990
lets you go and dive deeper
into the structure.

464
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,460
So I'll go ahead and hit that.

465
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:18,630
CHROMEVOX: Entered math--
x equals minus b plus--

466
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,620
DAVID TSENG: And you
heard that again.

467
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,720
There was a sound icon that

468
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,640
represents exploring something.

469
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,470
And you heard the expression
starting to read again.

470
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,010
And I just stopped it, for
the sake of brevity.

471
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,720
So how do we actually
go and figure out

472
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,130
what pieces are here?

473
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,350
What's the general geography?

474
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,810
So there is this concept of
granularities, in ChromeVox,

475
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,450
that lets you zoom in and zoom
out, essentially, of something

476
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,160
on the page.

477
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,770
So I'll go ahead
and press that.

478
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,690
And let's hear how
that sounds.

479
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,740
CHROMEVOX: Down to
level one-- x--

480
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,070
DAVID TSENG: So I just
moved down a level.

481
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,610
And I'm in a bigger chunk
not as big as the whole

482
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,790
expression.

483
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,470
So what is this?

484
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,100
This is x.

485
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,470
And it's obviously very
important, so we let the user

486
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,440
hear that in isolation.

487
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,050
And we have some keys
to move you around.

488
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,010
And those are basically to move
you forward and backward

489
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,880
on the current level
of things.

490
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,460
So let's hear what
that sounds like.

491
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,260
And I will move forward.

492
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,150
CHROMEVOX: --equals--

493
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,080
DAVID TSENG: So "equals" is
obviously also very important

494
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,720
in this equation.

495
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,915
So what's the next thing?

496
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:35,790
And I will go ahead and
press Next again.

497
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,740
CHROMEVOX: --minus b plus/minus
square root of b

498
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,880
square minus 4ac
divided by 2a.

499
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,420
DAVID TSENG: And you
heard, again,

500
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,780
that whole, big fraction.

501
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,370
And you heard the pitch changes,
and everything else.

502
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,120
And I will press the
Next key again.

503
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,280
CHROMEVOX: Minus b

504
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,890
DAVID TSENG: Oup, and you heard
a little "ch-ch" sound.

505
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,330
And that represents that we've
bumped against an edge.

506
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,380
So there's only three big
chunks in this thing.

507
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,770
And as a user that, perhaps,
has never seen this formula

508
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,620
before, well, I now have a
really good sense of all the

509
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,800
big pieces, and all the
big players, here.

510
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,180
But say I, still, am a little
bit hazy on this fraction, and

511
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,440
I want to look a little
bit more.

512
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,710
I can actually dive
in even deeper.

513
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,280
So let's do that, and hear
how that sounds.

514
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,330
CHROMEVOX: Down to level 2--
minus b plus/minus square root

515
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:37,570
of b square minus 4ac

516
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,020
DAVID TSENG: And you heard
the numerator.

517
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,270
So that sounds great.

518
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,890
And let's move forward.

519
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,030
CHROMEVOX: 2a

520
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,520
DAVID TSENG: And that's
the denominator.

521
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,720
So that all makes
a lot of sense.

522
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,620
And let's try moving
forward again.

523
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,000
CHROMEVOX: 2a

524
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,180
DAVID TSENG: Oup, bounced
against an edge.

525
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,360
Move back.

526
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,610
CHROMEVOX: Minus b plus

527
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:54,850
DAVID TSENG: OK.

528
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,820
We heard that before.

529
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,720
Move back again.

530
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,440
CHROMEVOX: Minus b

531
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,335
DAVID TSENG: Oup, another edge.

532
00:25:58,335 --> 00:25:59,180
All right.

533
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,480
So we've gotten a really
clear sense of where

534
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,010
everything is, again.

535
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,800
So I can even dive
even further.

536
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,330
And let's do that, real quick,
into this numerator.

537
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,470
CHROMEVOX: Down to level 3--

538
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,380
minus

539
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:11,730
DAVID TSENG: OK.

540
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,360
Minus

541
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:12,530
CHROMEVOX: Minus

542
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,150
DAVID TSENG: Oup, that's
the beginning.

543
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,710
So let's move forward,
instead of backward.

544
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,050
CHROMEVOX: B plus/minus

545
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,120
DAVID TSENG: Forward

546
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,635
CHROMEVOX: Square root of
b square minus 4ac.

547
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:26,180

548
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,150
Square root of--

549
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,440
DAVID TSENG: --oup,
and that's the end

550
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,700
CHROMEVOX: --b square
minus 4ac.

551
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,850
DAVID TSENG: And if we really
wanted to, we can even dive

552
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,900
into the square root.

553
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,330
So let's do that.

554
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,786
CHROMEVOX: Down to level
4-- b minus 4ac.

555
00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:42,140

556
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,380
DAVID TSENG: And that's it.

557
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,240
So with that, it is our hope
that students will be able to

558
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,090
then really easily explore
an equation like this.

559
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,180
That's now becoming
possible with what

560
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,750
we're doing with ChromeVox.

561
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,610
And in the past, you would have
had to rewind and fast

562
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,870
forward through a tape, and do
it that way, or perhaps, if

563
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,780
you're really lucky, get
math through braille.

564
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:16,460
But with the possibility of
using online math, now you can

565
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,730
get it in real time, and
look up a wealth of

566
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,180
information on the web.

567
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,520
So with that, I'll pass back
to Volker, who will discuss

568
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,150
some of the intricacies of
actually applying some of

569
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:33,010
these text to speech changes,
and the way we speak, and some

570
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:37,300
cool stuff that you, as a
developer, can actually do to

571
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,560
improve any math that you
might come across.

572
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,080
VOLKER SORGE: And this, as you
have previously mentioned

573
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,540
earlier, at the moment, what
we've demonstrated to you, the

574
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,670
way things were spoken, is
very, very verbose in the

575
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,780
sense that every single
element is indeed

576
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,240
being spoken out.

577
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,360
Now that is not necessarily
how mathematics is being

578
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,995
spoken in real life.

579
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:01,270
All right.

580
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,500
Often, you omit things, although
they are written.

581
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,570
And this is something we can--

582
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,940
I'm going to demonstrate a few
examples where things are

583
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,830
being very awkward when
everything is being spoken,

584
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,720
and where we then apply changes
to our underlying

585
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,300
structure and rule base in order
to have them spoken more

586
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,600
intelligently.

587
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,040
And I will then, afterwards,
tell you how this is actually

588
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,690
being done, and how that can
be customized by users,

589
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,650
themselves, or by creators
of web pages.

590
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:39,890
Right.

591
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:45,160
So this is, here, a Wikipedia
page with a matrix example.

592
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,930
So matrixes are particularly
difficult to speak, because

593
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,490
they are fully two dimensional
objects.

594
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,990
And I'll show you, at first,
how we could speak it in a

595
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,265
full, verbose fashion.

596
00:28:55,265 --> 00:28:58,570

597
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,650
CHROMEVOX: Left square
bracket matrix--

598
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,610
element one, one--

599
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,380
1.

600
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,670
Element two, one--

601
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,260
9.

602
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,570
Element three, one--

603
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,040
minus 13.

604
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Element one, two--

605
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,880
20.

606
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,240
Element two, two--

607
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,750
5.

608
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,290
Element three, two--

609
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,305
minus 6.

610
00:29:19,305 --> 00:29:20,670
Right square bracket--

611
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,930
full stop--

612
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,830
math.

613
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,780
VOLKER SORGE: Right, so as you
could hear, everything was

614
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,850
being spoken.

615
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:31,150
Every bracket, every punctuation
is being spoken.

616
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,660
Now we have the possibility,
in ChromeVox, to actually

617
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,700
change the underlying
representation in a way that

618
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,790
we can get a bit more
intelligence, a bit more

619
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,620
semantics in there,
if you like.

620
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,410
And actually, I'll do that now,
in order so you can see

621
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,340
how this is being spoken then.

622
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,990
CHROMEVOX: Matrix--

623
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,520
row one, column one--

624
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,490
1.

625
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,310
Column two--

626
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,200
9.

627
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,100
Column three--

628
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,190
negative 13.

629
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,332
Row two, column one--

630
00:29:57,332 --> 00:29:58,216
20.

631
00:29:58,216 --> 00:29:59,320
Column two--

632
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,180
5.

633
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,060
Column three--

634
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,072
negative 6.

635
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:04,840
Math.

636
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,540
VOLKER SORGE: Right, so as you
can see here, ChromeVox is

637
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,980
slightly more intelligent.

638
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,790
It applies a slightly
better way of

639
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,350
pronouncing rows and columns.

640
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,120
In particular, it omits some
of the punctuation which is

641
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,780
not strictly necessary for a
reader to know, exactly.

642
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,160
Whether this is a round bracket
or a square bracket,

643
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,860
in this particular instance,
might not make any big

644
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,910
difference.

645
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,140
Right.

646
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,940
These things can get
particularly worse when the

647
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:39,060
underlying representation is
very similar, however the

648
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,000
meaning is particularly
different.

649
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,860
So let's go back to our
square root example.

650
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,320
And I'll read you the first
example here, in the normal,

651
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,040
verbose style.

652
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,340
Let's go to this case
statement down

653
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,780
here, on the page.

654
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,480
CHROMEVOX: Square root
of x square equals--

655
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,450
vertical line--

656
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,160
x--

657
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,140
vertical line--

658
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,880
equals--

659
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,280
left curly bracket, matrix
element one, one--

660
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,510
x comma--

661
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,760
element two, one--

662
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,880
if x greater than
or equal to 0--

663
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,250
element one, two--

664
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,110
minus x comma--

665
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,360
element two, two--

666
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,940
if x less than 0.

667
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,490
Full stop-- math.

668
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,220
VOLKER SORGE: So what you could
hear, now, was that it

669
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,090
not only spoke everything in a
very verbose way-- all the

670
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,400
vertical bars, as well as
the opening brace--

671
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,220
but ChromeVox also fell into the
trap that it saw something

672
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,385
it thought might look
like it's a matrix.

673
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:45,250
Because it's exactly the same
MathML structure, underneath,

674
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,560
as the matrix on the previous
page, which I have

675
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,360
demonstrated.

676
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,490
Now if we apply some slightly
more intelligent way of

677
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,640
reading this here, we actually
get something

678
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,160
slightly more sensible.

679
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,480
CHROMEVOX: Equation sequence--

680
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:06,060
square root of x square equal
absolute value of x equal--

681
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:11,760
case statement, case one-- x, if
x greater than or equal to

682
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,270
0-- case two--

683
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:18,295
negative x, if x less than 0.

684
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:20,350
Full stop-- math.

685
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,780
VOLKER SORGE: So you could see
here that what happened was

686
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:31,160
that now, first of all,
ChromeVox has a more semantic

687
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,510
interpretation of
the expression.

688
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,160
It gives you a quick summary
at the beginning-- it's a

689
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,280
sequence of equations.

690
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,200
So there's more than two
parts of the equation.

691
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,450
And then, it reads it in a
more intelligent way, by

692
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,660
realizing something is an
absolute value, as well as

693
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,970
actually finding the case
statement correctly, rather

694
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,640
than pronouncing it as a matrix,
as it has done before.

695
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,650
And a similar semantic
interpretation can then be

696
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,920
applied to all the
other statements.

697
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,470
So if you go back, for instance,
to this statement

698
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,130
here, and pronounce it, first,
in the old way--

699
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:18,880
CHROMEVOX: f left parenthesis
x right parenthesis equals

700
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,270
square root of x-- math.

701
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,475
VOLKER SORGE: All right,
supply some semantics.

702
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:29,805
CHROMEVOX: f of x equals square
root of x-- math.

703
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:31,240
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

704
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,930
So as you could see here,
instead of pronouncing all the

705
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,490
parentheses, we now say "f of
x." Because we realize this

706
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,860
is, indeed, a function
application, and we pronounce

707
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,950
it accordingly.

708
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:46,350
Now the way this is being done
is by using an underlying

709
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:50,770
speech rule engine, which allows
for various ways of

710
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:55,990
customizing the rule base that
is being used in order to

711
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:00,090
speak the mathematical
expressions.

712
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:04,230
And I'll explain, very briefly,
how that works.

713
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,790
Effectively, what happens is
the math expression is, of

714
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,510
course, a tree representation.

715
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,530
In particular, it's a MathML
tree representation.

716
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,540
And this representation is
recursively being traversed.

717
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,889
And in every node,
an applicable

718
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:23,750
rule is being computed.

719
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,090
And that rule then has some
actions which fire, in the

720
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:33,530
sense that they produce some
speech output, as well as

721
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,810
produce a way to further
recursively traverse the rest

722
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,870
of the tree.

723
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:45,030
And these rules can be
customized in various ways.

724
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,429
One way of customizing them is
customizing them with respect

725
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,080
to mathematical domain.

726
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,489
So what might be useful in one
mathematical domain might not

727
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:55,710
be the same in another
mathematical domain.

728
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,130
And when I say "mathematical
domain," what I actually mean

729
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:04,290
is something like algebra,
geometry, analysis, calculus,

730
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,610
things like this.

731
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,550
So you might want to pronounce
one expression, in algebra,

732
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,130
differently than in geometry.

733
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,860
In addition to this, we have
the possibilities of

734
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,210
customizing rules
by their style.

735
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,760
And when I say "style" here, I
mean something like, do I want

736
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,010
it to be spoken short.

737
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,450
Do I want it to be spoken in a
verbose mode, for instance.

738
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,710
Do I want it to be spoken in
some particular way that I

739
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:35,510
like, and nobody else
likes, et cetera.

740
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:40,570
And finally, we also have the
possibility of swapping the

741
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:47,610
underlying representation
while the

742
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,870
speech engine is active.

743
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,700
So that's what I've
just showed you.

744
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,130
The underlying MathML
representation, here, was

745
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,700
swapped out with a more
semantic enriched

746
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,950
representation.

747
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,080

748
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,160
Now the problem with this
semantic enrichment is, of

749
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,320
course, that this is a fairly
ad hoc procedure.

750
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:14,820
MathML is a language which
primarily aims for display.

751
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,140
So there's two types
of MathML.

752
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,720
One is called Presentation
MathML, and one is called

753
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,470
Content MathML.

754
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:29,620
The idea of Presentation MathML
is that it takes care

755
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,210
of how the math expression is
being laid out on the page.

756
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,650
And this is what we're currently
working with.

757
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,490
The idea of Content MathML is
that an author of a math

758
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,600
expression actually puts
in some semantics.

759
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,880
Unfortunately, that is hardly
available on the web.

760
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,970
Therefore, what we have to
do is we have to take the

761
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,840
Presentation MathML expression,
and interpret it

762
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,000
in a way that seems
reasonable to us.

763
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,200
Obviously, this can break
down in many cases.

764
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,450
And therefore, the person who
actually knows best how to

765
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:06,440
interpret a MathML expression is
generally the author of the

766
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,200
expression, themselves.

767
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:14,390
As a consequence, we believe
that it is very useful for

768
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,410
people to actually be able to
customize the speech rules in

769
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,510
a way that they will pronounced
the MathML

770
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,370
expressions they write
in the correct way.

771
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:29,790
We therefore, in ChromeVox,
offer an API to users out

772
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,780
there, to authors of web pages,
to developers of EPUB 3

773
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:40,130
readers that allows them to
define their own math rules--

774
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,030
either override or add
to our rule base--

775
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,890
in order to have math
expressions being spoken in

776
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,380
the way they prefer.

777
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,560
And the rest of the time I will
now spend introducing

778
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,190
this particular way of--

779
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,790
these particular rules, as well
as demonstrate how they

780
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,640
can be written, and what the
different components

781
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,820
of these rules are.

782
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,380
Let's, for this purpose, all
go back to our favorite

783
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,880
example, the quadratic
formula.

784
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,930
We'll start manipulating the
division in the formula in

785
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,130
order to demonstrate how
we can change rules.

786
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,554

787
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:28,006
Right.

788
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,980
Here, I'll bring up the
console quickly.

789
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:36,830

790
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,380
Let me get back to
the expression.

791
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:46,700
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals minus b plus/minus

792
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:53,300
square root of b square minus
4ac divided by 2a--

793
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,080
math.

794
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,770
VOLKER SORGE: Right, so this is
the default way, currently,

795
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,821
ChromeVox speaks
the expression.

796
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:05,290
I will now write a rule
here, in the console.

797
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,710
I've already written it
previously, so I'll just bring

798
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:13,230
it up here, and explain to you
the components that will alter

799
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:17,050
to the way the expression
is being spoken.

800
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:17,760
Right.

801
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,790
So what you can see here, in
detail, is that we have--

802
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:31,270
these function names are the way
one can call ControlVox--

803
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,070
sorry, not ControlVox,
ChromeVox--

804
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,110
through the API.

805
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,760
So here's the ChromeVox API.

806
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,895
It's, in particular,
the math API.

807
00:39:37,895 --> 00:39:41,360
And it offers a defined
rule function.

808
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,265
And the function here, at the
moment, has four components.

809
00:39:43,265 --> 00:39:45,470
All of these are string
components.

810
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,470
The first component is a name.

811
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:54,980
It's practically irrelevant
what that name is.

812
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,700
The whole idea of a name is that
one can more easily find

813
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,300
the rule later, somewhere in the
speech rule engine, say,

814
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,910
for debugging purposes.

815
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,870
But for now, we can
just ignore this.

816
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,960
So we'll just call this
"fraction rule."

817
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,370
Then, comes some admin
information which has to do

818
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,840
with the domain, and the style,
I've been referring to

819
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,240
previously.

820
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,550
So the domain was, just to
recall this, the idea that we

821
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,490
can specialize our rules with
respect to different

822
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:28,150
mathematical domains such as
algebra, geometry, et cetera.

823
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,020
In addition, we always have a
default domain, which is the

824
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,880
one we're working on right now,
which means that if, for

825
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,490
a particular domain, no rule is
there, we can always fall

826
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:43,381
back to the default rule.

827
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:46,060
And currently, the way domains
are being selected is

828
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,180
interactively, by the user.

829
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,060
Right.

830
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,840
So this is what the default,
here, says.

831
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,040
Then, we have a little dot,
which separates the domain

832
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,840
name from the style name.

833
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,760
And styles--

834
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,430
again, we have styles like
short, verbose, or I think we

835
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,890
also have super brief.

836
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,470
But there is no limit to what
you want to call your style.

837
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,980
If you want to call your style
after your personal name, then

838
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,010
we'll have an additional style
in ChromeVox, in the future.

839
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,350
And again, there is
a default style.

840
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,410
Here, we're working, now, on
the default domain, and the

841
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,370
style is short.

842
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,290
All right.

843
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:27,880
And then, the rest of the rule
is effectively a way how to

844
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,230
test whether a rule is
applicable, plus the action

845
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,300
the rule is supposed
to perform.

846
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:38,000
In ChromeVox, this is given
the other way around.

847
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,530
We first start with the action
and then with the

848
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:47,550
precondition, or the part of
the rule that tests whether

849
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,770
the actual rule is applicable.

850
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:55,130
I'll tell you, in a second,
why this is the case.

851
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:00,210
Let's first have a look at this
letter part, which talks

852
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,410
about the precondition if
the rule is applicable.

853
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:10,010
What we want is a node, which
is our fraction up here.

854
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,410

855
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:19,660
This division node is given
by a MathML tag,

856
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,560
which is called mfrac.

857
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,480
And we select this using an
XPath expression here.

858
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,350
So this is a regular XPath
expression, which just says,

859
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:30,320
well, the current node--
the node we are on--

860
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,940
is a node with an mfrac tag
in the MathML name space.

861
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,550
So this is just a regular
XPath expression.

862
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,050
Then, the rule will fire.

863
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,420
And it will perform
it's action.

864
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,500
So what are the Actions?

865
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,680
Well, actions are a sequence
of components of different

866
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,240
things the rule does.

867
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,910
In this case, we only have
one compartment.

868
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,060
And that component is currently

869
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,270
composed of two things--

870
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:05,000
the type of the component,
as well as

871
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,550
what is being performed.

872
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,330
So the type of the
component here is

873
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,970
given in square brackets.

874
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:15,880
In this case, the type is t,
which means it's just a text

875
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,160
that is being spoken.

876
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,440
And the text that is being
spoken is then given as a

877
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,500
string here, in string syntax,
with double quotes at the

878
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,560
beginning and the end.

879
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,430
So when we find the division
node, all we want, at this

880
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:32,560
point, is a string being spoken
where it says, "some

881
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,440
division." Let's put
that rule in.

882
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,440
And let's see what ChromeVox
says now.

883
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:44,180
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division-- math.

884
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,000
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

885
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,870
That's all it says--
some division.

886
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,260
x equals some division.

887
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,580
We haven't specified
anything else.

888
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:58,250
In particular, what we have not
specified here is how it

889
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,820
should deal with any of the
other content that's still in

890
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,990
the expression.

891
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,710
So all we say at this
point is, say one

892
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,150
string and then stop.

893
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,551
Do not recurse any further.

894
00:44:09,551 --> 00:44:13,280
I'll show you, in a second, how
we can do that, otherwise.

895
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,440
Let's first talk a bit more
about the precondition.

896
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,340
So the precondition here is an
XPath expression, as I said,

897
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,690
that selects this particular
node--

898
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,290
this particular node
with the mfrac tag.

899
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,630
So it's this division node.

900
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:31,350
Now in addition to this, one
can then give additional

901
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,230
constraints.

902
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:37,080
And the number of additional
constraints is unlimited.

903
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,170
Therefore, this is the reason
why we put the precondition at

904
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,460
the end of this particular
rule definition.

905
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,840
Because you can add more, and
more, and more, and more

906
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,280
constraints to it.

907
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,720
And I'll add one constraint,
just for you to be able to see

908
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,980
what this will look like.

909
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,050
So when we say, OK, so we want
this rule just to be

910
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:04,930
applicable to something
that says that

911
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,970
it's the node, itself.

912
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:14,186
And it has a descendant, which
is an m square root.

913
00:45:14,186 --> 00:45:15,000
All right?

914
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,890
So that means it has a
descendant, which is a square

915
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,950
root, up there.

916
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,545
And again, this is in the
MathML name space.

917
00:45:23,545 --> 00:45:28,650

918
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,370
Right, sorry.

919
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:33,300
Unexpected token means I have
forgotten to close my

920
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,880
expression, my string
expression,

921
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,010
with a square root.

922
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:41,490
Let's see whether
it's applicable.

923
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,520
Well, the thing is that we
haven't really changed any of

924
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,020
the actions.

925
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,040
So let's change the actions,
so we can actually hear

926
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,030
whether the different rule
is being applied.

927
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:59,166
"--some division with
square root."

928
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:07,280
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

929
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,030
square root-- math.

930
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,750
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

931
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,830
So this has, indeed, worked.

932
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,990

933
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,400
And it now applies
the other rule.

934
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,710
So we have specialized the
rule even further.

935
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:25,240
So in addition, we can now add
more and more constraints.

936
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,780
Anything XPath1 allows you to
express, you can express in

937
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,770
these constraints.

938
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:31,140
And those are binary
constraints.

939
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,930
So they only have
to hold, or not.

940
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:38,870

941
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:39,100
Right.

942
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,230
So this is as far as I want to
explain the preconditions.

943
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,000
Now let's examine, a bit
further, what we can do in

944
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,750
terms of the actions
of our rule.

945
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:51,610
In particular, just having one
string pronounced, if you

946
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,540
actually have a complex
expression, is usually not

947
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,240
very fruitful.

948
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,440
So we might want to have
a bit more pronounced.

949
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,710
Therefore, let's dive into the
expression and pronounce some

950
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:05,210
of the child nodes, actually.

951
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:05,910
Right.

952
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,580
So we now start a
new component.

953
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,470
Components are being separated
by semicolons, so that's very

954
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:15,320
similar to what you have
in regular JavaScript.

955
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,190
And we now want to specify
a new component.

956
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:21,460
And this is a particular
component which works on

957
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,940
single nodes.

958
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,500
So therefore, it gets
the type n.

959
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,740
Again, the type is given
in square brackets.

960
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,570
And now we can write a selector
which is just yet

961
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:34,010
another XPath expression.

962
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:39,160
So we write another XPath
selector that selects whatever

963
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,720
child we want to work on,
or whatever node we

964
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,350
want to work on.

965
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,630
It doesn't necessarily
have to be a child.

966
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:49,540
You can effectively also work
on any other node that is

967
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:54,600
reachable from this particular
node you're on.

968
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,680
But in our case, we want
to work on the child.

969
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,470
But let's not work on both.

970
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:01,090
Let's just work on the second
on, for instance.

971
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:05,220
So this XPath expression, now,
just selects, from the given

972
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:09,610
node, the second child node.

973
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:10,450
Right.

974
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,820
And what the action now does
is it will pronounce the

975
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:18,000
string "some division with
square root." And afterwards,

976
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,050
it will ask the speech rule
engine to recurse on this node

977
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,948
that we have selected here.

978
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:27,370
Let's do that again.

979
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:31,920
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

980
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,740
square root 2a--

981
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,632
math.

982
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:35,080
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

983
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,570
So what you can hear is that we
heard the expression up to

984
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,520
the division.

985
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,350
Then, it would pronounced
the string.

986
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:46,630
And then, it would pronounce
the second child node.

987
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,060
Right.

988
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:52,110
Similarly, we could now
put in more content.

989
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:57,570
So say we put in another
string of type t.

990
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:00,300
Say this is now a string
called a numerator.

991
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,760

992
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,970
And we now, for instance,
want to recurse on the

993
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,530
first node, as well--

994
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:15,630
on the first child as well,
not the first node.

995
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:16,510
Let's do that.

996
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:17,535
Let's listen to what's
happening.

997
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:24,630
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

998
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,190
square root 2a and
numerator minus b

999
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,770
plus/minus square root--

1000
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:31,910
VOLKER SORGE: I'll
stop it here.

1001
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,770
We all know what the
numerator is.

1002
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,630
But you can see how
this now works.

1003
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,820
Now one of the things that David
pointed out earlier was

1004
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,810
that you can actually do changes
to the way the text to

1005
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:48,370
speech engine speaks things
from within a rule.

1006
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:49,810
And let's do that.

1007
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:54,090
The way this works is by
adding, in particular,

1008
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,410
annotations to each component.

1009
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:02,310
So for instance, say we want
to change the pitch on the

1010
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:06,310
first component that's
being spoken.

1011
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,220
Or in our case here, it's the
second component of the

1012
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,310
denominator.

1013
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:14,240
And let's say we just want to
have a significantly pitch

1014
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,390
change, say, to 1.5.

1015
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,870
Let's see how that sounds.

1016
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:24,580
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

1017
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:29,630
square root 2a and numerator
minus b plus--

1018
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,420
VOLKER SORGE: So you could
hear that the pitch was

1019
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:36,030
changed quite drastically when
the denominator of the

1020
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,860
division was being pronounced.

1021
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:48,920
So the way we do these
annotations is by adding in

1022
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:54,560
round brackets, the particular
property we want to change, as

1023
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,980
well as the value
that changes it.

1024
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,610
All right.

1025
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:59,770
So in addition, we can, for
instance, also increase the

1026
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,110
rate of the speech.

1027
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,940
Say we increase it to 2.5.

1028
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,710
And now let's see what's
being spoken now.

1029
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,940
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

1030
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:14,400
square root 2a and
numerator minus--

1031
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,120
VOLKER SORGE: That
was not really--

1032
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,770
That was--

1033
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:19,270
CHROMEVOX: Simple school
algebra, Volker Sorge, the

1034
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:21,100
third April, 2013

1035
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,360
VOLKER SORGE: Sorry, that was
not much of a change.

1036
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,610
I'll just refresh the console
so we can see a bit more.

1037
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:31,590
Let's try to change it to
something different.

1038
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,740
Maybe 0.5 will make
a difference.

1039
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:39,160
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

1040
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,450
square root 2a and
numerator minus--

1041
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:43,810
VOLKER SORGE: Now you could
hear that it was actually

1042
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,060
quite a bit faster.

1043
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:50,100

1044
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,130
So what else can we
do with this?

1045
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:55,730
Well, another thing that we've
heard earlier was that we can

1046
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:01,270
add pauses to our rule.

1047
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:02,540
Let's do that as well.

1048
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:07,260
Let's add a pause annotation,
say, to the second--

1049
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,830
uh, no, to the first
of these--

1050
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:13,210

1051
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,220
children that we speak.

1052
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,770
And let's add quite
a drastic pause.

1053
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,030
Pauses are given in
milliseconds.

1054
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,910
So let's add one second,
so we can actually

1055
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:23,270
hear it more clearly--

1056
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:26,874
so 1,000.

1057
00:52:26,874 --> 00:52:31,020
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

1058
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:37,234
square root 2a and numerator
minus b--

1059
00:52:37,234 --> 00:52:37,726
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

1060
00:52:37,726 --> 00:52:43,830
So the effect you could hear
here was something I wanted to

1061
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:44,900
demonstrate.

1062
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,640
It is that the pause, as well as
all the other annotations--

1063
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,420
i.e. the pitch and the rate--

1064
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:56,320
than we give a particular node
here, or particular component,

1065
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,620
are recursively being applied
by the speech rule engine.

1066
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:04,650
That means if we change the
pitch somewhere, this pitch

1067
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:11,180
change will be propagated
further down in the recursive

1068
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,680
traversal of the tree.

1069
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,290
That means is we have nested
expressions, and we change the

1070
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:19,890
pitch several times, these
changes will add up, which

1071
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,177
gives a very nice effect
when it comes to

1072
00:53:22,177 --> 00:53:23,140
pitch and rate changes.

1073
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,580
It doesn't really give a very
nice effect when it comes to

1074
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,540
pause changes.

1075
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,960
Because what that means is
that the pause is applied

1076
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,470
after every single element
that occurs.

1077
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,510
So you might want that.

1078
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:36,080
But you don't necessarily
want that.

1079
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,200
So in this particular
case, we don't.

1080
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,660
So how do we actually do it in
order to apply the pause

1081
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:46,260
between two chunks, rather
than having it applied

1082
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,840
recursively, during traversing
the tree?

1083
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,320
The way this works-- and I'll
show it to you here--

1084
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:56,430
is by adding the pause
explicitly as we recall a

1085
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:59,850
personality annotation,
which is another

1086
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,230
component of the actions.

1087
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:04,590
And this component
has the type p.

1088
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,300
So we put that in here.

1089
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,780
Let's get the bracketing
right.

1090
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,392
And let's see what
happens now.

1091
00:54:09,392 --> 00:54:12,104

1092
00:54:12,104 --> 00:54:16,530
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

1093
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:21,694
square root 2a and numerator
minus b--

1094
00:54:21,694 --> 00:54:22,161
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

1095
00:54:22,161 --> 00:54:25,110
What you could hear now was that
the pause was actually

1096
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:30,180
only applied straight after
the denominator had been

1097
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,430
pronounced.

1098
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,760

1099
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,290
Right.

1100
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:39,480
And in addition to this, we can
also, for instance, change

1101
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,730
the volume.

1102
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:43,420

1103
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,850
But I'm not going
to demonstrate

1104
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,070
that now, in detail.

1105
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:48,610
Instead, I'm going to
demonstrate one final thing we

1106
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:53,590
can do with these speech rules,
and also, one final

1107
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,330
component--

1108
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,700
one type of component--

1109
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,930
for the action.

1110
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:02,160
And that is useful when you have
a node where you do not

1111
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,760
necessarily know how many
children the node has, and you

1112
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,280
want to recurse over
all these nodes.

1113
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,340
And we'll do that--

1114
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,590
give them our division here.

1115
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:21,240

1116
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:21,540
Right.

1117
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,440
And this component is
of type m, which

1118
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,050
just stands for multinode.

1119
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,840
And you then give it
a set of nodes.

1120
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,120
In our case, we select the set
of nodes, again, with an XPath

1121
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,890
expression, which is
just all subnodes--

1122
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:40,620
or all child nodes-- of
our mfrac expression.

1123
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,430
Let's do that.

1124
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:42,450
Let's see what happens.

1125
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:46,310
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

1126
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:51,190
square root minus b plus/minus
square root of b

1127
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:55,290
square minus 4ac 2a--

1128
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:56,256
math.

1129
00:55:56,256 --> 00:55:56,740
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

1130
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:01,330
So what you could hear now was
that all the elements are

1131
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:04,920
actually being pronounced
properly this time, in order,

1132
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,890
because this is just the regular
order within the

1133
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:11,050
MathML expression.

1134
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:14,320
Now obviously, for an expression
like division,

1135
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,430
where you really know that you
only have two children, this

1136
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,590
might not make a lot of sense.

1137
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:21,990
But if you do not know exactly
how many children there are--

1138
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:25,330
say, in the matrix expression
we've demonstrated earlier--

1139
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:29,960
you have to use this way off
accessing the children.

1140
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,840
And then you have, in addition,
the opportunity, or

1141
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,960
the possibility, to put in
something that is being spoken

1142
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,410
in between all of these
expressions.

1143
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:41,780
And the last thing I'll
demonstrate to you now is

1144
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:48,960
giving what we call a separator
string as a further

1145
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,190
annotation to our component.

1146
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:56,070
And the separator is just a
regular string, in this case.

1147
00:56:56,070 --> 00:57:10,380
And let's just say, "divided
by," and spell it right, and

1148
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,452
see what happens now.

1149
00:57:12,452 --> 00:57:16,350
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

1150
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:22,710
square root minus b plus/minus
square root of b square minus

1151
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:26,240
4ac divided by 2a--

1152
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,500
math.

1153
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,340
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

1154
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:35,390
Back, we are, at the original
expression.

1155
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:35,870
Right.

1156
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:41,620
So this, so far, is the
explanation of this API.

1157
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,930
And why did we go into that
much detail in order to

1158
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,220
demonstrate to you how
this API works?

1159
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,210
Well, the basic idea of
ChromeVox is, since it is an

1160
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:53,760
open project, that we're
hoping that people will

1161
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,340
exploit this API in the future
in order to write explicit

1162
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,680
speech rules-- say, on
their web pages--

1163
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,610
to make sure that the math they
write, or they put on the

1164
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:07,160
web, is pronounced
in the right way.

1165
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:12,920
And for instance, I personally,
as a university

1166
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,830
lecturer, university professor,
could imagine that

1167
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:21,490
I'll put some of my lecture
notes on the web.

1168
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:26,490
And as I know exactly how things
have to be pronounced,

1169
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:31,480
I also put speech rules there
so my students with visual

1170
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,950
impairments can actually go
there, and listen to the math

1171
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,260
in the correct way, in exactly
the way I would

1172
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,166
speak it in my lecture.

1173
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:40,690
Right.

1174
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:44,080
And with this, I'll end my part
of the presentation and

1175
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,030
pass back to David, who's going
to conclude with some

1176
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:50,280
more details on ChromeVox
and the project.

1177
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,640
DAVID TSENG: All right, thank
you so much, Volker.

1178
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,620
I wanted to conclude by
thanking everyone for

1179
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,750
watching, and sticking with us
through all of our demos.

1180
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:04,260
You can find a little bit more
information about ChromeVox on

1181
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,000
chromevox.com.

1182
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,850
And we are an open
source project.

1183
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:11,870
So you can actually even take
a peek at all of our code,

1184
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:17,060
including all of the things
that make math possible.

1185
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,980
We'd be happy to take any
feedback that you have.

1186
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:24,520
You can also visit us, in
general, for accessibility, at

1187
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:30,400
Google, at the address
google.com/accessibility.

1188
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,520
Thanks again for watching.

1189
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,170
And we hope to receive any
feedback that you have.

1190
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,420
Thanks.

1191
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:42,838
