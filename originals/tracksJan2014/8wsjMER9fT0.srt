1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,550
When editing CSS in
DevTools, you can now easily

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,420
increment or
decrement values using

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,452
some new shortcuts we've added.

5
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,990
In the sources pane, you
can use Alt-Up or Alt-Down

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,660
to increment or decrement
by a value of 1.

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,815
You can also use
Alt- Page Up or Page

8
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:18,640
Down to increment or
decrement by a value of 10.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,300
Now, let's say that you love
working in the elements pane.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,710
Well, you're probably used
to inspecting an element

11
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,350
and then going to
the styles pane

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,995
to actually go play
around with values.

13
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,680
Well, you can go and find
the property to work with.

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,400
And similar to what
you're used to,

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,600
you can still use
the Up and Down keys

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,715
to increment or decrement
by a value of 1.

17
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:40,280
You can also now
increment by a value of 10

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,530
or decrement using
Shift-Up or Shift-Down.

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,556
And using Shift-Page
Up or Shift-Page Down

20
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:50,940
you can increment or
decrement by a value of 100.

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,340
And finally, for those
ultra-specific properties

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,900
you can use Alt-Up and Alt-Down
to increment or decrement

23
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,129
by a value of 0.1.

24
00:00:59,129 --> 00:00:59,628
