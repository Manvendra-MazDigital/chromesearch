00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:06,260
>>Ankit Jain: Good morning, everyone. It's
so great to see so many of you early here

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,700
on day three of Google I/O.
Last night, I wasn't sure if I was going to

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,439
make it this early.
My name is Ankit Jain, and I lead all things

4
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:21,119
search and discovery for Google Play. I'm
extremely excited to be here and share this

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,269
material with you today.
As most of you know, we've never discussed

6
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:31,329
our search or discovery engine publicly before
today. But before I get started, I wanted

7
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:36,000
to get to know you guys a little better.
With a raise of hands, how many of you are

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,960
making money on Google Play today?
Great. How many of you would like to make

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,949
even more money on Google Play?
Great. For those on YouTube, pretty much everyone

10
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:52,219
would like to make even more money.
Let's step out of our normally roles as developers

11
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,820
or business owners and for a second, let's
step into the shoes of our users, and think

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,100
like a user when you come to the store.
How many of you have installed an app just

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,140
while browsing, you were bored, you opened
the Play Store, saw something interesting,

14
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,690
clicked through, and installed it?
Okay. How many of you have installed an app

15
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,660
because you thought about, I need to get something
done. I need a recipe app, or I need to find

16
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,620
a train schedule, went looked for it, and
then installed it.

17
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,560
Okay. That's a smaller -- smaller portion.
And how many of you have installed an app

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,280
because a friend of yours told you, "Hey,
you really have to go check out this app."

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,130
And then you go to the store, look for it,
and install it.

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,810
Great.
So my goal today is to talk to you about how

21
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,640
we try to bring these online and offline thought
processes of how all of us install apps and

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,770
how we try to get that discovered on Play.
So I'm going to present you with three high-level

23
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,020
sets of information. The first one is our
vision for the new Google Play Store.

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,590
The second is some of the details of the search
and discovery algorithms that we have and

25
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,770
how you can take advantage of them to get
discovered more.

26
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,590
And, finally, I want to leave you with five
very concrete examples of what you can do

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,130
to get discovered more on Play.
Sounds good?

28
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,069
All right. Great. So let's get right into
it.

29
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,310
A few weeks ago, we rolled out the new version
of the Google Play Store. It's very different

30
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,280
from what we had in the past, a year ago,
a few of us stepped aside and said if we could

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,230
reimagine the entire store, the new Google
Play experience, what would it be like?

32
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,370
The goal was to come up with something that
was dynamic, very fresh. The user should be

33
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,730
trained and look forward to coming back into
the store, something that is personalized,

34
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,120
yet personal.
So some of you might be thinking, Ankit, what

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,510
are you saying? Personalized, yet personal.
What's the difference there?

36
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,510
Well, personalized, to me, is something that
is personally relevant, related to what you

37
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,300
have told us in the past, what users have
purchased, what -- personally relevant because

38
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,490
it's popular in the user's area. Personally
relevant because the user has shown interest

39
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,430
in certain categories or in certain developers.
Or personally relevant because your friends

40
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,740
are showing interest in those things.
Then we want to take you to the next level.

41
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,120
We want to make it personal by showing you
and annotating each of these recommendations

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,250
or each of the pieces of content in our store
with why you should get it.

43
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,190
This could be a +1 by a friend. This could
be a review by a friend. Or this could be

44
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,660
something based on the new Google Play Game
Services that three others are currently playing

45
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,030
Puzzles & Dragons. We should tell the user,
this is why you should get it. And our goal

46
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,069
was to help each and every one of you, each
and every one of our developers, to get people

47
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,880
more engaged installs. Because at the end
of the day, that's what's really going to

48
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,860
move the needle. Those are the users that
build sustainable and great businesses.

49
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,190
So our goal was threefold: First, to help
our users find what they're looking for as

50
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,580
effortlessly and seamlessly as possible. Second,
to help Android ship more, and more beautiful,

51
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:58,580
apps. And, finally, to help all of you build
even more thriving businesses on top of our

52
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,450
platform.
So let's get to the meat of today's talk.

53
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,069
Let's talk about our major install source.
At the ends of the day, nothing can be built

54
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:12,910
unless you have installs. Specifically, I
want to talk about how to get engaged installs.

55
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,250
So most of you have reached -- many of you
reached out to me in the past and said, "Hey,

56
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,469
I'm ranked number five or number ten or number
50 on these top lists or on these trending

57
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:26,580
lists." These are what I call our browse and
discovery features. I like to break them into

58
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,889
three subcomponents.
The first are these top charts, the top lists,

59
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:35,340
the editors' picks, the trending lists. The
next are the features that we launched at

60
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,129
Google I/O last year. These were the personalized
recommendations. Some of you saw these as

61
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:44,400
part of the Google Play home page experience
in the cluster there. Others might have seen

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,900
this on the widgets on the Nexus 7 and the
Nexus 10 on the home screens there.

63
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,870
And the last set of features that we have
for discovery, based on your context, are

64
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,210
the related and cross-sell items. These are
the users who viewed X also viewed Y on the

65
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,830
details page of all of your apps. Also, the
other set, which is users who installed this

66
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,610
app also installed these other apps, which
is also on your details pages. And we'll get

67
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:14,439
into details of each of these and how we look
at them and how the algorithms are built.

68
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,430
What most developers don't think about as
much is the search component. For the average

69
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,990
app, search actually makes up the vast majority
of installs. And when I think about search,

70
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,379
I like to break it down and look at our query
stream from -- in terms of two kinds of queries.

71
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:33,870
The first are the kinds of queries that many
of you raised your hand for, which are, I

72
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,199
had to get something done, so I looked it
up. I needed to look up a recipe. I wanted

73
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,860
to find a restaurant review in a city that
I'm in. I wanted to find multiplayer games

74
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:49,439
or free games, or RPG games, the kind of categorical
queries. You know the general idea of what

75
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,569
you want or what you want to do, and then
you use search to find the right app for -- to

76
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:58,699
fulfill that.
The second kind of query is where you know

77
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:03,719
exactly what you're looking for. This is when
a presented has told you about an app or if

78
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:06,069
you heard about it through marketing, navigational
queries.

79
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:10,930
Hey, I want to get a hotel tonight. I want
to get Beautylish, or I want to get Angry

80
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,029
Birds, which is not necessarily a single app,
it could be a set of apps, but you know what

81
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:19,520
direction you want to look in. That's navigational
queries.

82
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,129
Just to show you how important search is,
in any given day, 12% of our active users

83
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:31,039
come back to the store and search at least
once for apps. In any given week, half of

84
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,479
our users come to our store and search for
apps.

85
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,789
And even -- given the number of apps we have,
in any given month, there's over 6 million

86
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:44,520
unique phrases that are being searched for.
So really thinking about search is important

87
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,289
as you try to figure out how to get discovered
on Play.

88
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:52,520
So just to put what we've talked about, I've
talked about our vision for Google Play and

89
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,740
how our goal is to present each user with
a personalized play, made personal. How search

90
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,169
and browse are the two main sources of installs
in the store. And, finally, a lot of this

91
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:08,409
happens because our goal is to bring the rest
of Google to Play. That was the transition

92
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:12,719
from Android Market into Google Play. It was
to integrate all of our systems together and

93
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:17,919
make Google Play a very smart store, make
it your store.

94
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,089
So now that we've talked about it, let's step
back and think about how we think of our search

95
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:27,080
and discovery systems.
When we built our search engines and our discovery

96
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,619
engines, we have two options. Either we can
spend a lot of time trying to detect the apps

97
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:35,909
that are bad or spammy or simply annoying,
or we can spend a lot of time trying to figure

98
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:40,520
out which apps are good.
And we spend a lot more time focusing on what's

99
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,149
good, because if we can promote the apps that
are not just good from what we can tell, based

100
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:49,689
on your APK, based on your metadata, based
on what users are telling us about each of

101
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:54,999
the apps, then other -- other users are also
going to find these delightful experiences.

102
00:07:54,999 --> 00:08:00,229
And so this part of the talk is going to be
talking about how you can complement your

103
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:05,469
app with good app metadata.
So the most important piece of your app metadata

104
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:10,860
is your title. It's important to be creative,
but it's just as important, if not more important,

105
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,139
to be very clear.
So this -- so this example up on screen is

106
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:20,039
about an app named Beautylish.
As you can see, most of you might not have

107
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,649
heard of it, some of you might have heard
of it, but right after you see the title,

108
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:30,539
you know this is about makeup and beauty tips.
So what this title helps you do is helps the

109
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:36,459
developer reinforce not just their branding,
but also what their app is about.

110
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:41,159
As you see this more and more often, either
in the store or even once you have it installed

111
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,230
in your list of apps on your home screen,
it's very clear that Beautylish is the app

112
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,870
I go to for makeup and beauty tips. So I highly
recommend thinking about the name of your

113
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:57,170
app. It also helps a lot for SEO. When someone
looks up beauty tips or makeup tips, these

114
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,990
guys are the top of that list just because
everyone associates the two of those terms

115
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,430
together.
The next important part of your details page

116
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:12,829
in your metadata is your description. You
can write as long a description as you want,

117
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:17,230
but I always say get the main message out
first.

118
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,050
Star Chart does a great job here. Their first
sentence says, "You can now have a virtual

119
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,910
planetarium in your pocket." Again, if you've
never used this app, you already know what

120
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,620
it's about. After that, you can go on, describe
it in more detail, list the awards you have,

121
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,480
and just have your sales and marketing pitches
for your users. But right up-front, make sure

122
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,850
your user knows what your app is about.
And on a smaller phone, that's the part that's

123
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,910
above the fold. So you want to make sure on
that first screen itself it's extremely clear

124
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,170
what your goal is, what utility you provide
or what entertainment value or whatever the

125
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,529
goal of your app is, what it provides.
Now, that also, again, helps a lot with getting

126
00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:01,350
found. This app is extremely optimized for
star charts, star maps, virtual planetariums.

127
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,540
So the beginning of descriptions are extremely
important, both from a user's perspective

128
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,769
and also from our search engine's perspective.
The next couple of slides, I'm going to talk

129
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:18,750
about how you can use your app details page
to mimic the real user experience. It's important

130
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:24,209
that you set the expectations of your user
to be very realistic, to really be what your

131
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,350
app is going to be like.
The first place to do this is in your screen

132
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:32,839
shots. In our developer console, we let you
upload screen shots for tablets, for phones,

133
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,730
and really show the user what it's going to
be like once you install the app.

134
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,019
Now, if you don't do this, and your app experience
is actually very different from your screen

135
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:46,410
shots, it can have a very negative effect
on all of your systems. Why? Because, well,

136
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,860
the user loves what they see in your details
page. They install your app. They open the

137
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,730
app. And then they see something very different.
What are they going to do? Well, most users

138
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,190
will uninstall the app. Some of those users
will go back to the store and give you a low

139
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,379
rating, maybe even write you a negative review.
And that negative feedback cycle is going

140
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,959
to hurt you more than help you.
And so really thinking about how do you present

141
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,430
the user with the right -- setting the right
expectation and then delivering on it, that's

142
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:20,190
the message here. We're looking for apps that
do deliver on their promises.

143
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:26,040
Video previews are the next level of screen
shots. With a short video, you're able to

144
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,959
show the user really what it's like to play
with your app. And developers have told us

145
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:36,610
that uploading a video can really help gain
user adoption. And users in a lot of studies

146
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,800
have told us that video previews are amongst
the most convincing features of an app details

147
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,120
page.
Again, the whole goal here is to tell your

148
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,829
user what your app does. If you can convince
them and make sure that -- and communicate

149
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:54,170
what your app's promise is and then deliver
on it, you're going to delight them, and they're

150
00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:00,870
going to recommend to you other users as well.
So I talked about reviews and ratings in terms

151
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:06,689
of the feedback loop. And this is a key part
of our search and discovery experience.

152
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:11,870
Now, the first piece of this comes because
people come back and review your app, whether

153
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,189
it's good or bad. The second piece is, we
really try to order our reviews and ratings

154
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:21,120
in an order that is relevant to the user.
So you are going to see reviews that are on

155
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,350
the same device as the current user, in the
same country as the current user, and as time

156
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,569
goes on, people that are in a user's circle
or people that the users trust are going to

157
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:34,579
come at the top of these reviews.
So investing in making sure that your users

158
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:39,069
are reviewing and rating your apps will be
key going forward, because that's a very strong

159
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:44,610
signal for us at Google Play.
So I'm going to step back and tell you a story

160
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,509
about a developer, a developer in India that
I was talking to a few weeks ago. And his

161
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:54,990
goal was to target the rural population. As
you can see on the graph on the right, about

162
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,699
75% of India's population lives in rural cities.
His goal was to target the audience that had

163
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:07,410
low- to mid-end phones and was on slow to
2G networks. He had really optimized his app

164
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,370
to give a delightful experience for these
users.

165
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,420
But then he reached out to me and said, Ankit,
when I look at my reviews, I have this polarized

166
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:22,259
view, there's a whole bunch of five stars
with people saying I could never imagine technology

167
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:27,069
would change my world this way. And also a
lot of one stars with people saying, "Complete

168
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:31,370
crap. I can't believe I downloaded this. Uninstalling
it right now."

169
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,120
Right? And he was perplexed. He wasn't sure
what was going on. We dug a little deeper.

170
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,720
One of the things we noticed was that he was
getting a lot of positive reaction from the

171
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,189
people in rural areas, his target audience.
And he was getting a lot of negative reviews

172
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:51,509
from the people on the 4G networks, on the
top-of-the-line devices, because his app just

173
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:56,620
was not designed for them. His goal was not
to go after that market. And so the thing

174
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,709
that he ended up doing was, he went to the
developer console and targeted his app to

175
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,279
the countries and carriers where his target
audience really was. And since then, he's

176
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,709
already seen an uptick in his average rating
and his reviews. And, hopefully, that continues

177
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:14,579
over time. But my message here to you is think
about who you're trying to target. For most

178
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,959
apps, you don't have to worry about this.
You can let your app get to everybody. But

179
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:24,230
if your app is targeted at a specific set
of target audience, make sure those are the

180
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,389
people helping you get even more adoption.
You don't want people not in your target audience

181
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:36,389
polluting your reviewer rating.
So we've talked about creating a very creative,

182
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:41,810
yet clear, message through your title and
description. To mimic your real world experience

183
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,850
through your images, your screen shots, and
your video previews. And, finally, really

184
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:52,019
about understanding your audience. This is
what's going to help you optimize your -- your

185
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:56,930
app details page.
So let's see how this manifests itself. At

186
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,180
the end of the day, there's the top charts
and the search engines. What are the things

187
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,279
we look for? Once you do all of these great
things in your app details page, how does

188
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:08,310
it feed back?
And no search or discovery system would be

189
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,300
complete without really taking into account
the statistics that we're constantly collecting.

190
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,600
So the first piece of this, as most of you
probably have already figured out, are the

191
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,220
installs. Of course we care about how many
installs each app has. The more you have,

192
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,670
the higher up in the rankings you'll go.
We also care about how many uninstalls you

193
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,389
have, because that's the metric for us to
know whether users are having a good or a

194
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:32,819
bad experience.
Now, some of you are game developers out there,

195
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:37,829
and you might say, hey, my game overall takes
one gig of memory or two gigs of memory on

196
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:42,189
a person's device. So after they're done playing
my game, of course they're going to uninstall

197
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:46,100
my app, because they want to play the next
game. You know, they've already won every

198
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,600
level there is. Why are you going to hurt
me? And that's why we have the third static,

199
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,139
which is long installs.
If a person plays through or uses an app for

200
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:59,170
a long period of time, we don't want to penalize
it. Our goal is really to detect the behavior

201
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,809
which is, hey, I installed an app, I really
did not have a good experience, so I'm uninstalling

202
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:07,120
it right away.
So the long install encapsulated that phenomenon

203
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,509
in it.
In the coming months, one of the things that

204
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:15,319
we want to focus on is engagement, and really
understanding for each of your apps when are

205
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:19,600
people using it, how are they using it, and
how is it different across different kinds

206
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,069
of apps. For example, Google Now, I just go
to it when I need to pick up my latest boarding

207
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:28,559
pass. I'm not going to spend tens of minutes
or hours on it. But there might be a game

208
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,019
where I spend an hour or two on it. But that
doesn't mean one is better than the other.

209
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:35,850
They're just different kinds of functions
they're providing.

210
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,209
This is an area where having a conversation
with all of you is great. And I really look

211
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,939
forward to having some of your feedback. So
a lot of this is about setting the stage for

212
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:47,670
the first conversation. We've never discussed
any of this before. So if you guys have ideas,

213
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:51,579
please let us know.
I'll talk about Google Play services -- the

214
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:55,519
game services that we launched and how we're
going to use that for engagement in the coming

215
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,410
months as well.
Here's a query that I get very often from

216
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:07,250
developers. "Hey, for some search query, I'm
number three even though the app ranked above

217
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,510
mine has fewer installs and has a lower rating
than me."

218
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,620
Right? I'm sure many of you have thought about
this as well.

219
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,420
On the previous slide, I talked about the
uninstall rate. Not only do we look at the

220
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,670
number of people that are uninstalling your
app compared to the number of people installing

221
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:29,390
it. We also have some amount of a recent -- recent
uninstall rate as well.

222
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:35,770
The idea here is that you might have an app
that has not been updated in a couple of years,

223
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,770
and now more people are uninstalling your
app than installing it. Or there's a newer

224
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,140
app, or your app could be on the other sides
of this where you made an update and now a

225
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,890
lot of people are really keeping your app.
That's going to help you move up in the rankings.

226
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,080
We want to make sure users are getting the
best apps as easily as possible.

227
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,960
So I hope this answers this very common question
that I get.

228
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,960
>>> (off mike) it's a shooting star phenomenon.
>>Ankit Jain: So the other piece of what we've

229
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,570
talked about a lot at Google I/O this year
is personalization across all of our products

230
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,570
at Google. And Google Play is no exception
to this. We're constantly slicing and dicing

231
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:20,590
all of the data that we're collecting in order
to personalize and improve each user's experience.

232
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:25,750
One -- I'll give you a couple of examples.
The query Yahoo! in the U.S. leads to people

233
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,260
installing the Yahoo! app or the Yahoo! Mail
app.

234
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,250
In Japan, however, people are installing the
Yahoo! Japan app. And over time, our systems

235
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:37,040
learned this and figured out, hey, in Japan,
show Yahoo! Japan as number one. In the U.S.,

236
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,170
show Yahoo! and Yahoo! Mail as number one
and number two.

237
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:45,240
Similarly, on tablets, people tends to install
different apps than they do on mobile devices.

238
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,960
Again, using the feedback loops of what people
are searching for, what they're clicking on,

239
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,170
and what they're enjoying and installing,
we're able to really tailor the search experience

240
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,570
and the search results per device type, per
locale, and across a whole bunch of different

241
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:05,280
dimensions.
About a year ago, in addition to having the

242
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,180
search suggestions as you type, we added the
ability to have navigational search suggestions.

243
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,800
These are suggestions that Google believes
are the right one for a user. So as the user

244
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,470
is typing in "sub," most users tend to actually
go straight to Subway Surfers. So we allow

245
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,740
them to do that right from the search suggest
box. If you click on that navigational suggestion,

246
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,460
you won't go to a search results page. You'll
go straight to the app's details page. It

247
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,220
even shows you the icon of the app that it's
going to take you straight to.

248
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,010
Now, if a user wants to find the tips or the
strategies or other apps that are around Subway

249
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,000
Surfers, they can still complete their query
and look at the app details page. Again, the

250
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
theme here is that we're trying to make it
easier for users to get what they want.

251
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,460
Let's switch gears a little bit, and I'll
let you guys look at this for a couple of

252
00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:00,460
seconds. There's a lot of data up there.
So a lot of you always have asked us the question

253
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:13,360
how are your top lists generated? When are
they generated and what's the rationale behind

254
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,620
them?
Like any search or discovery system we're

255
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:23,620
constantly tuning our systems. And this is
a snapshot of what it looks like recently.

256
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:29,960
There's a basic quality barrier that's there.
There are some review and rating metrics that

257
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,500
we take into account, but at a high level
we create top lists daily per country, per

258
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,550
category and even per device type.
You guys saw some of the design for tablet

259
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:44,790
top lists that were launched earlier at I/O,
and our top paid free and grossing lists are

260
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,820
really targeting first-time users to Google
Play or people who just got a new device because

261
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,870
they're looking for the basic apps they need
to load up in order to get their stuff done.

262
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,680
What's most popular on Google Play?
The top new paid and top new lists are targeting

263
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,970
users who have the basic apps and saying,
Hey, what's new right now, what's new and

264
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,020
popular?
And for that reason we limit it to the apps

265
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:12,010
that have been published in the last 30 days.
And this is very important because many app

266
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:17,290
developers launch an app in a single country
and then over time roll it out to a bunch

267
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,710
of countries.
So I get a question a lot of times saying,

268
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:26,340
Hey, I just launched in Italy last week and
it's going gangbusters. We're just getting

269
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,650
more installs than we ever have. How come
we're not in the top new free or top paid

270
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,490
list?
Well, the reason is your original launch might

271
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:39,780
have been six months ago so you're not qualified
to be in the top new list of even new countries

272
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,240
that you launch in. It's a global publish
date that we look at.

273
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,070
So think about your global rollout strategy,
if being in the top new list is part of your

274
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:54,910
strategy, a 30-day window extremely important.
And the metrics across these are different.

275
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,340
For the grossing we look at the revenues.
For the others we look at installs over the

276
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,630
last several days.
The next list that I want to talk about is

277
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:09,610
our trending list, and this is one that has
had no clarity about it ever.

278
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,620
Internally we like to call this our movers
and shakers list. Our goal here is to present

279
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,830
the user with a system that can give them
what's really hot right now. Amongst all the

280
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:26,330
apps on Google Play, what are the apps that
a lot of users, more than we predict, are

281
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,000
being installed?
We have a predicted growth rate. This predicted

282
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,840
growth rate takes into consideration where
in your app life cycle you are and how many

283
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,940
installs you have.
And if a given app performs significantly

284
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,910
better, if it starts getting installs much
faster than what we predict, it makes it into

285
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,550
this movers and shakers or trending list.
So when the soccer World Cup was going on

286
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:53,300
a few years ago, the FIFA app was at the top
of this list.

287
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,130
Last year when the unfortunate tsunami hit
Japan, many radiation tracking apps were at

288
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,970
the top of this list.
Any app can be can be part of this list and

289
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:07,250
we're looking at a 30-day window to figure
out really what's hot right now.

290
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:13,640
I mentioned the related and cross-sell features
that we have. On every app's details page

291
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,050
there are the people who viewed this also
viewed these other apps and the users who

292
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,740
installed this app also installed these other
apps.

293
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,680
So let's go through a few examples. The first
one is Bank of America. The user looking to

294
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,350
do banking, when they're considering a banking
app they might consider other banking apps,

295
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,960
PayPal or Wells Fargo, but once they've decided
to get the Bank of America app they're more

296
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,620
likely to install a complementary app, not
a supplementary app. Here you see them installing

297
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:45,150
a trading app such as Merrill Edge or another
app by the same developer, the BOFA help app.

298
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:50,580
In the middle is an example of a user looking
to get a Bible. Users looking to get a Bible

299
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,250
might consider the various options, but once
they get the Bible they will get other religious

300
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,010
apps, not other Bible apps, so it's complementary
to what they've gotten.

301
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:04,620
The third is example is a widget that helps
users show the time on their home screen.

302
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,760
They might consider digit clock or dash clock,
but once they installed the dash clock, they

303
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,590
bought into that style, that ecosystem, so
then they're more likely to install other

304
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:18,630
widgets or other add-ons that have the same
style, have the unified experience on their

305
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:24,440
Android device.
Last year at Google I/O we launched personalized

306
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,780
recommendations. As I said, these were on
the home screen of the Google Play home page

307
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:35,320
and they've been performing extremely well.
With the new launch of Google Play we really

308
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,840
decided to double-down on this and start personalizing
many different parts of our system.

309
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,590
So I thought it's a good opportunity for me
to tell you what really we look for. We have

310
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,610
over 80 signals not just from Google Play,
but also from the rest of Google, but some

311
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:54,390
of our major signals include apps that are
complementary and supplementary to apps that

312
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,660
users installed in the past. We look at apps
that are popular in a user's area. We look

313
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:05,400
at apps that have been +1'd by a user's Circles,
reviewed by a user's Circles. We also look

314
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,210
at apps that are developed by some of you,
if the user has already shown interest in

315
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,710
your developer account and by other apps by
you.

316
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:19,470
So here are some recommendations for three
different users. You can see +1's by people's

317
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,350
friends. You can see apps that are similar
other things they have bought and also apps

318
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:28,520
that are popular in their area.
So how does this manifest itself? So this

319
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:34,320
is the home page that we envisioned. This
is going to start rolling out to users in

320
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,990
the coming months.
On the left is my grandma's home page. That's

321
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:45,350
what she sees. She grew up very close to military
quarters in India because my grandpa lived

322
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,800
in that area.
And she was very interested in getting stuff

323
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:56,800
done. We call her the colonel of the family.
So for her growing up in a military area means

324
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,440
you play a lot of cards. She actually plays
two to four hours of card games a day. It's

325
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,230
ridiculous. I don't know how she does it.
So seeing the tablet highlight apps for her

326
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,590
and seeing the card games right up there is
really what's relevant to her.

327
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,300
For me, I travel a lot and so on the tablet
highlight section not only do you see Google

328
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,440
Translate, which I should get so that I can
communicate with people all around the world,

329
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,890
but it also tells me why. It tells me that
my friend (Indiscernible) has +1'd this app.

330
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:32,890
He had a great experience so that helps me
improve trust in the system and get this app.

331
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,470
You can take this a step further. On all of
our category home pages -- both of these are

332
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,480
for me. On the left, I live in San Francisco,
so you see the San Francisco Giants app, you

333
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,910
see the Oakland baseball app, you see a Sacramento
Kings app.

334
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:51,650
On the right is the news home page. You see
news apps and magazine apps that are related

335
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,950
to what I've bought in the past. I have Pulse
and people who have Pulse tend to also enjoy

336
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,010
the "New York Times."
It's amazing to me the "Times of India" comes

337
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,750
on my personalized home page, but it wouldn't
on some of yours just because my friends tend

338
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:11,710
to come from that part of the world and they
say this is a great app, to adopt it.

339
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:16,970
How can we apply personalization to search?
I've talked about using location. So a user

340
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,000
in Japan will see different results for Yahoo!
than a user in the U.S. But we think categorical

341
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,790
queries are a place that we can really help
the user find what they're looking for.

342
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,590
Imagine a user searches for free games. If
we know that they like word games, showing

343
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,290
them free word games makes a lot of sense.
If they like RPG games, that will help them

344
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:43,290
get a much faster acquisition rate.
For train schedules, a user in New York should

345
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,260
get the subway train schedule, a user in San
Francisco should get the BART train schedule

346
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:54,520
or the Cal train schedule. It just makes sense.
So over the coming months we're going to roll

347
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,250
out more experiments, and finally to everybody,
personalization across categorical searches.

348
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,980
So I've thrown a lot of things at you so far.
So just to step back and summarize, we've

349
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,600
talked about the search statistics, the feedback
loops that we've looked at in order to improve

350
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,040
or search and discovery systems. We talked
about navigational search suggestions. We

351
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,510
talked about how our top charts are created
across each category, generated daily and

352
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,940
across every country. We talked about what
trending apps are, what it means to be in

353
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,820
there and how you can get in there. We talked
about how related and cross-sell works. And

354
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,380
we also talked about how we're starting to
personalize play and how that's going to roll

355
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,480
out over the coming months and how that really
fulfills our vision of a personalized play

356
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,200
made personal.
So I promised you guys I would leave you with

357
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,160
five things that you can do to improve your
discoverability on play. So let's get right

358
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,600
into it, but before we do that I want to tell
you it's just as important to build a good

359
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,350
app. So take the time to go through those
app developer guidelines on developer.android.com

360
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:01,600
and make sure you have a good app. You can
complement that by optimizing on the store,

361
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,500
but at the end of the day nothing substitutes
a very good experience for your app.

362
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:13,560
Two months ago we added a list of guidelines,
the tablet app guidelines, what it means to

363
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:20,030
be designed for tablets. And I highly recommend
that you get the design for tablet designation.

364
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:25,440
Earlier at I/O we announced design for tablets
top lists on some of our home pages. Over

365
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,870
time this is going to roll across the store
so a tablet user gets the best experience

366
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,190
possible by showing the apps and promoting
the apps that have gone through the trouble

367
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,300
of making that experience better.
So you're going to see this not just in the

368
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:46,410
top list, but over time in search and in all
of our other discovery features as well.

369
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:51,320
The developer console helps you with the optimization
tips that they have added and the next talk

370
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,340
by Ellie, Miles and Riccardo will go through
this in detail, what you can do to really

371
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,770
get some of these designations. So get the
design for tablet designation.

372
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:06,790
Number two -- and this is a much less known
fact about the way we do search ranking at

373
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,060
Google Play.
Today most articles that are published on

374
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:16,410
the Web about play apps have a link at the
end that says Google Play Store or play link.

375
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:20,840
Actually, over 99% of anchors that we get
into the Google Play Store just have those

376
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,570
two phrases and that doesn't help us at all.
We want to help you get discovered even more

377
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,950
on play.
Sure, you tell us a little bit about your

378
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,320
app, but if a trusted source -- on the right,
for example, Tech Crunch, is telling us what

379
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,880
your app is about. Even before you have any
installs, we can trust it and start boosting

380
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,690
you for those terms.
So next time you're talking to a blog writer

381
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:47,430
or someone writing an article about your app,
have them give you some link juice. Have them

382
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:52,380
put something interesting in those links linking
to your app.

383
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,410
The third one is to avoid common mistakes.
I told you there were six million and more

384
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,600
unique phrases that are searched for every
month. What I didn't tell you is over half

385
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:09,550
of them are misspelled. That's amazing that
half the people are mistyping queries, but

386
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:14,100
that's how the query stream is on mobile today.
So as Google, what we have to do is we have

387
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,010
to aggressively correct for it. We have to
make sure we help the user find what they're

388
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,740
looking for even if it's a typo.
So the one thing you can learn from this is

389
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:28,960
don't name your app something that is a cute
but a common misspelling of a very popular

390
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,400
app because chances are you will get -- a
user looking for your app will get auto corrected

391
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,580
into something that you're not happy with.
A second thing I already talked about using

392
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:44,060
the targeting expressions on the developer
console carefully, which countries and carriers

393
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,990
you're targeting depending on your target
audience.

394
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,620
And the third one again is one that we have
-- that is a little subtle, but I think it's

395
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:57,600
important. If you do have a developer URL
that is not a play.google.com link or a code.google.com

396
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,480
link, something that is your home on the Web,
if it exists do make sure you upload that

397
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,740
in the developer console.
Why? Well, we crawl the Web, we index the

398
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:12,390
Web for our Web search engine and we use a
lot of those signals in order to help you.

399
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:17,610
If we know that you're the kind of developer
that is about a specific subset of the world,

400
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,310
we will help you get discovered when people
are looking for those terms on Google Play.

401
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:28,310
So again, if you have a developer URL other
than something at Google.com, do upload that.

402
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Number four is to make your APK smaller, right?
Users tend to install smaller apps a lot more

403
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,100
than they do larger apps and they tend to
uninstall larger apps at a higher rate as

404
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,360
well.
Let's think about why. As your phone runs

405
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,770
out of memory, there is a finite amount of
memory, users tend to go through the list

406
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,190
of apps they have in decreasing order of size
and start uninstalling the apps that they're

407
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,400
using least actively.
So the further down that list you are, the

408
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,700
less likely you are to be uninstalled. So
make your APK size smaller.

409
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,120
In the coming months we'll start looking deeper
into the APK from a search and discovery perspective

410
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,370
as well. We're going to look at the kind of
SDK's you're linking with, the libraries you're

411
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:17,220
linking with, to figure out what is your app
really about, looking at the kind of sites

412
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,340
that your app is connecting with by emulating
it and try to figure out what is your app

413
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,970
about so we can help users find apps that
will help them do what they're looking to

414
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,870
do.
And the last one, and this is something many

415
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:36,820
of you have asked us for, is to create a second
channel of distribution, the viral channel.

416
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,510
There hasn't been too much of a viral channel,
and I'm going to go to go through a through

417
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,860
things that we'll be pushing over the coming
months.

418
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:48,230
The first are highly rated apps. These are
apps that your friends, your circles and others

419
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:53,510
that you trust have rated highly in our store.
So here are some apps that are rated highly

420
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:59,050
for me. On the right you see the Quora app
is rated highly by my roommate David, he rated

421
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:04,990
it five stars. Then Logo Quiz, my friend Rivika
said it's an extremely fun game, so addicting

422
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:09,119
she couldn't stop.
That's the personal touch that we can add

423
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,629
to the Google Play Store. Some of these apps
have never been on the home page. This is

424
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:20,230
the easiest way for each of you to get on
Google Play's home page, have your users review

425
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:25,929
your apps. Their friends will start seeing
them on their Google Play home page.

426
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:31,210
I've talked a lot about +1's already. +1's
have been an integral part of our system since

427
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,940
we first launched personalized recommendations
last year.

428
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,050
The reason I bring it up again is because
there's an API which I'm not sure why many

429
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:44,610
of you are not using. This API is available
on the Google+ recommendations API page and

430
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:50,710
it enables you to allow your users to +1 an
app from within your app so you don't have

431
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,950
to have a message that says "Go to Google
Play and +1 my app."

432
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:58,790
You don't need to have your users leave your
experience. Keep them in your app. We want

433
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,990
to make it easier.
So we already have in-app billing for you

434
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,830
guys. There's in-app +1. And in the coming
months we're going to also have in-app rate

435
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,380
and review.
So again, we don't want your users to leave

436
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,900
your app. If we can do what they need to do
from within your app, great and we're going

437
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:17,650
to help you with that as well.
The last thing to create the viral loop is

438
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:22,580
to integrate with Google Play Game Services.
At first what you will get is when someone

439
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,900
opens your app they can see which of their
friends are playing, they can find opponents.

440
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,130
It makes your app more interactive. You have
the multiplayer, you have the leaderboards.

441
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,040
It makes your app social.
In the longer term, though this along with

442
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,150
the Google+ moments API, which allows you
to share specific pieces of information, "I'm

443
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:44,240
currently playing this game" or "I am at level
27 of this game," will allow us in the store

444
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,590
to annotate and make things more personal.
How great would it be if my home page said,

445
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,960
"Right now Shelavi is looking for an opponent
on Riptide."

446
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,570
That's not only the best way to get someone
to install your app, but open it right away,

447
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,770
get you those engaged users that you're looking
for.

448
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:06,470
So I highly recommend integrating with the
Google Play game services.

449
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:11,110
Again, the five things that you should do
to get discovered more on play, get the design

450
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:16,610
for tablets designation, start getting helpful
Web anchors, avoid some of the common mistakes

451
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:21,660
about misspelling because we have to auto
correct for them, and targeting your audience

452
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:27,850
correctly, reduce the size of your APK and
then really start closing that viral loop.

453
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:34,580
Help your users promote you in addition to
depending on just the store.

454
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,870
So we've talked a lot about user acquisition.
I've talked about the organic growth that

455
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:44,560
you can get from the search and discovery
aspects of the Google Play Store. We've talked

456
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,150
about the viral aspect of search and discovery.
And many of you already know about the paid

457
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:52,080
aspect, which is important to some of your
businesses as well.

458
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,080
I won't talk too much about it, but what I
will say is that investing in paid user acquisition

459
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:03,780
can have a very positive impact on organic
and viral growth as well. And so if you can,

460
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,020
it is something to think about in the bigger
picture of things.

461
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:14,710
Now, user acquisition is just the first step
in creating lifetime value for your users.

462
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:19,640
As a business owner I always like to think
about my key metrics and have a very good

463
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,030
handle on them. And the one that I've found
in the mobile space and any user-centered

464
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,090
space is the lifetime value of every one of
my users.

465
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,680
We talked about user acquisition. Let me briefly
mention the other two.

466
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,450
User retention I like to break into two different
ratios. The first is a short-term user retention

467
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:41,460
ratio. This is how do I initially keep my
users?

468
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,580
Most of the time this happens because the
users like what you're promising them. They

469
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,570
install your app, they open it.
The long-term user retention ratio, which

470
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:53,470
is very much like the long install metric
that I talked about, is the ongoing mechanics

471
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:59,200
of your app or what are you -- you delivering
on your promise?

472
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,370
So an example of Scramble With Friends, initially
they got a lot of their users because it was

473
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:09,960
very much like the word games that we grew
up with, but over time their social, their

474
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,590
interactive features are what kept it growing
and made it successful.

475
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,860
User monetization, I look at it in terms of
two different lenses. The big picture is the

476
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:23,500
revenue per install, and that makes sense.
It's a very good macro metric and it's comparable

477
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,940
to your user acquisition cost, your cost per
install is low so you can do that. But the

478
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:33,090
real picture is the revenue per active user.
That's what you have most control over, the

479
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:37,540
people that are in your system, in your game,
in your app, and how can you tune it to make

480
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,630
the most money?
So as you think about your users try to break

481
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,060
it down into key metrics and have a very good
handle on them.

482
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:49,130
So I hope this talk has helped you get a good
idea of how we build some of our search and

483
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:54,440
discovery systems. My goal was to really start
this conversation. I want to continue it.

484
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,610
And none of this would have been possible
without my team at Google Play. So this is

485
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,480
my shout-out to them. Thank you for doing
all the great stuff that you've done.

486
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,380
And for all of you, thank you for being here
so early. I would like to continue this conversation.

487
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,930
I'll be at office hours right after this,
so if you have any questions please come there.

488
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:17,950
Or you can reach out to me on Google+ or Twitter
and I'm happy to continue this. Thank you

489
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,329
very much.
