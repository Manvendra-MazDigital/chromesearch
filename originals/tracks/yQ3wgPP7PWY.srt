1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,439
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: Hello. Good morning,
everyone. Welcome to the making money on Google

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:11,250
Play session. My name is Ibrahim Elbouchikhi.
I'm project manager for commerce on Google

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,510
Play, and Bob Meese over there is my colleague
who is from business development on Google

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,960
Play.
Let's get started. Where's the clicker?

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,960
Clicker? Here, sorry.
Okay. So first I wanted to start by just saying

6
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:32,910
thank you. Over the past 12 months we've talked
to a lot of you, got a lot of great feedback

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,129
that we baked into the product. A lot of the
features that you will see next have really

8
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:42,800
been developed in -- by working with you and
getting your feedback. So let's continue that,

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,879
let's continue that conversation. Keep sending
the feedback, the good, the bad, the ugly,

10
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,629
and we promise we'll keep working on it and
making things better.

11
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:54,800
We'll start off with the office hours which
is happening next, so come by the Google Play

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,890
office hours section and we'll talk there.
So the agenda for today, we'll first share

13
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,899
some data. These are metrics that we feel
are interesting for you as you build your

14
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,340
business on Google Play.
We'll then give you a product update. These

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,860
are features we've launched recently and their
impact as well as features we look forward

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,010
to in the midterm.
Finally we'll talk about some case studies

17
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,820
about what some of our most commercially successful
partners are doing.

18
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:25,330
And finally we'll close out with Q and A in
the office hours by the Google Play section.

19
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:32,330
So let's get started with some data. Last
year Chris Yerga got on stage, I think exactly

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,900
this room, and showed us the growth trajectory
of in-app. It looked something like ridiculous,

21
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,030
well, reverse, like going up to the right.
And we were very excited about that growth.

22
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,210
This year we've actually done something even
more incredible, which is that we've multiplied

23
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,750
in-app revenue by seven. So over the past
12 months -- there are very few industries,

24
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,190
companies, countries, anything that grows
that fast over 12 months, and this is a testament

25
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,370
to all the work you have all been doing.
Users are engaged with the applications you've

26
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,030
been building and they're willing to pay for
them and are really enjoying them. So that's

27
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,370
just incredible.
So we wanted to look beyond the number and

28
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,550
say what is this telling us about the Google
Play and Android user? And one thing we've

29
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,940
learned is we've heard this a lot from our
Japanese partners, which is omotenashi. And

30
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,980
what omotenashi means essentially, it's hospitality,
but it's got a bit of a deeper sense. It's

31
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,850
got more of a personalized experience. It's
almost like not a buyer and seller relationship,

32
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,540
it's a host and a guest.
And what this is, it's essentially what in-app

33
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,360
represents, right? In-app is about getting
the user to enjoy the application, to really

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,450
get immersed into it before getting to monetization.
We've heard this a lot in all sorts of saying,

35
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,290
focus on the user experience and the money
will follow. And that's exactly what in-app

36
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,910
represents.
Now, in-app is not for everyone and we've

37
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,850
got very successful subscription partners
as well as paid app developers, but if you're

38
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:05,430
able to inject some omotenashi into your application,
please try, and that's the message from this

39
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,330
number.
Subscriptions launched about 12 months ago

40
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,660
as well, and since launch we're very excited
that the number of subscribers has doubled

41
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:21,050
each quarter. Subscriptions have a pretty
high hurdle. The user has to see continuous

42
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:27,800
value. They have to commit to recurring subscription,
and it's a pretty high hurdle for subscription,

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,580
but yet we're seeing more and more users taking
that step and that's again because of the

44
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,500
applications and the content you've all been
creating for our users.

45
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,470
There's no better example today than Pandora,
which is a partner on the top grossing list,

46
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,040
one of the few non-games that's completely
based on subscriptions.

47
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Now, Android is a global platform clearly
and Google Play store is equally global. We

48
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,880
have buyers in 134 markets, so by pushing
that button in the Google Play developer console

49
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,830
and pushing your app for sale you're making
it available to buyers in 134 countries.

50
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,800
This is unprecedented distribution. Never
before has distribution been this easy and

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
efficient. For you as a developer, wherever
you are in the world, whether you're a solo

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,389
developer or a multinational corporation,
we take care of everything for you and we

53
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:22,860
just have to push that button and get your
application out there.

54
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,539
Now, the countries that we've overlaid on
the map, some of them are probably already

55
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:32,539
in your mind, they are particularly large,
growing fast, but there are also other countries

56
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:37,729
that we feel will play a big part of the next
12 months so we're excited about that. We've

57
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:42,479
launched a lot of features around localization
and translations at I/O so take advantage

58
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:49,240
of that and map them up to that set of countries,
the 134, and hopefully you will see success

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,270
globally.
Tablets have been a big part of Android over

60
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,800
the past 12 months. And the way the conversation
generally goes is that we ask you to optimize

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,360
your apps for tablets, and as a business owner
you look at the cost and you say that's additional

62
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,240
cost. Is that where I invest my resources?
And I know you have very limited resources

63
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,039
like everyone else.
And the number I want to share with you today

64
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:20,039
is a tablet monetizes 1.7 extra rate of a
phone, so that additional cost of optimizing

65
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:25,960
your tablets, your application for tablets,
is well worthwhile. And we want to see more

66
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,370
of our developers doing just that.
We've launched a lot of features on our end

67
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,860
as well, whether it's the optimization tips
for tablets or the guidelines to help you

68
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,469
do this as well.
The other metric that's interesting is recent

69
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:45,469
platform releases monetize at 2.2X their prior
versions. What this is telling us is, again,

70
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,599
as you build your application take advantage
of the latest platform features. Whether it's

71
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:58,599
Google+ sign-in or all of the APIs that launched
at I/O this week, all of that coming together

72
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:03,969
actually has a tangible impact on your revenue.
It is not just nice to have, they might be

73
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:08,770
actually required for you and you can more
than double your revenue by actually adopting

74
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,900
those new features.
Next this is a very intuitive message, right,

75
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,789
higher rated applications monetize better.
We wanted to give you a sense of just how

76
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:21,749
much better.
If you go from 1 to 2 let's not talk about

77
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:27,150
those, but if you go from 2 to 3-star you
are actually almost doubling your revenue.

78
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,099
And again, if you go from 3 to 4 stars you're
actually almost tripling your revenue. So

79
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:37,819
a conversation we have around quality and
reply to reviews and fixing bugs and good

80
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:43,139
customer experience and good support, all
of that has now a tangible impact on your

81
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,819
revenue. And that's what we're going to demonstrate
with these metrics.

82
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:52,219
Finally, as it was mentioned in the keynote,
over the past year we've more than doubled

83
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:57,559
average revenue per user. This is even given
the incredible growth that Android itself

84
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:03,740
has been having, 900 million devices has grown
our pool by 2.5X.

85
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,669
This is the baseline metric that every platform
is measured by. How profitable are we for

86
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:13,020
you? And this is really exciting for us, this
particular development. It's a testament to

87
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,939
the type of experiences you've been creating
and how engaging and immersive they have been.

88
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:24,669
So we'll go now into the product update portion.
And I know it might be obvious or it might

89
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:29,219
be intuitive, but I always like to start with
the baseline understanding of our mission.

90
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:34,319
We have a bunch of people who work on payments
sprinkled around the room and all of us show

91
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,509
up to work everyday because we want to make
our developers successful, and in the context

92
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:42,080
of payment we want to make sure we maximize
your income.

93
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,050
So when you work hard and build an application,
an awesome application, we want to make sure

94
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,229
you're getting the most value out of that
work. That's just the baseline understanding.

95
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:56,169
That's why we show up to work everyday and
a lot of us that's our goal and objective.

96
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:00,789
So with that in mind I again like to think
of things in terms of frameworks to just simplify

97
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:04,369
the conversation. In this case I picked a
really simple framework.

98
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:08,199
We try to maximize your income, which means
we're going to increase your sales and reduce

99
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,960
your costs. So our conversation going forward
is going to be in this context, how are we

100
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,159
maximizing your sales and reducing your cost
in order to maximize your income?

101
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:24,499
We've also talked to you about what drives
your sales, and you've told us a bunch of

102
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:29,179
things. One is the number of devices out there.
How many tablets do we have? The other thing

103
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:33,469
was how many markets you're targeting. So
if we're growing really fast in a particular

104
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:37,969
region, but you're actually not localizing
to it or tailoring the experience to it, you're

105
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,250
not really benefiting from that.
The aspect is the quality of your application.

106
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,269
We just saw if you go from three to four you're
tripling your revenue. Your aspect is how

107
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:51,139
many buyers do we have, how many credit cards
do we have on file, how many carrier billing

108
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:55,290
accounts do we have?
And then the purchase experience, how smooth

109
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,759
is it, how well does it convert? This all
impacts your sales.

110
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,759
And finally, all of these things that happen
after the fact, whether it's cancellations

111
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,699
because of a poor user experience. The user
did not get the item they purchased and they

112
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:11,779
call and that becomes a poor user experience.
So all of these things drive your sales.

113
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,279
In terms of costs you've told us about three
big buckets. These are things we've talked

114
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,199
about in terms of tablets and optimizing for
them or adopting new platform features. Engineering

115
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:26,370
work. You've got to have engineers and you've
got to have QA, you have to have back office

116
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,810
and accounting. You have user acquisition
costs. So marketing, paid installs, whatever

117
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,519
it is.
Then you have your support costs. These are

118
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,440
the three buckets that your costs largely
fit into.

119
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,060
So with that in mind I want to share with
you some things we did to help in each of

120
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,290
these areas.
So more forms of payment. This is clearly

121
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,329
comes up all the time. What have we done over
the past 12 months to address that?

122
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:56,920
First off is the Google Play gift card. It
actually only launched in July of last year.

123
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,550
And since then it's --
[ Applause ]

124
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,180
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: Woo, that's right.
>>Bob Meese: Somebody is happy.

125
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,000
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: It only launched in
July of last year and since then it's become

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,310
incredibly successful for us. And it's omnipresent
in U.S. retail locations, it's in the U.K.

127
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,959
now. You can see us continue to invest in
the Google Play gift card. The whole prepaid

128
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,759
form of payment is critical to us.
The other aspect is we launched campaigns.

129
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,639
And what campaigns are essentially in this
case, if you bought a Galaxy S3 you get a

130
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:31,000
free Galaxy s3, which is awesome, but also
you got $50 to spend on Google Play.

131
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,720
What this does is, one, it ingests money that
gets spent on your applications. And two,

132
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,910
it lowers the hurdle for users to go from
a free app buyer, consumer to actually a purchaser.

133
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,610
And our experiments have shown that when the
user makes one, two, three purchases, they're

134
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,790
much more likely to make the fourth and fifth
even when their credit is over.

135
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:57,069
Finally, carrier billing. The exciting number
I want to share with you today is that 50%

136
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:02,769
of Google Play 30-day actives are now on carriers
that support carrier billing.

137
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:07,940
What that means is that they are one button
click away from becoming buyers. They don't

138
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,250
have to type numbers, no expiration dates,
they just have to enable it and then they

139
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,779
can start buying. And this is a really critical
number for us.

140
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,769
And as a background, if you're not aware of
what carrier billing is, it's essentially

141
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:24,379
the ability to put your purchases on your
monthly bill. This is something that's unique

142
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:29,629
to Google Play and we've invested a lot in
the technology behind it.

143
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:32,899
So the other thing you said is the purchase
flow. We've heard a lot about our purchase

144
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,160
flow in the past.
I don't know if you've been through the new

145
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,139
store as well as the new purchase flow, but
it's a really exciting development for us

146
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:43,709
and a lot of the design came in from feedback
you gave us, which was that you wanted the

147
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:49,500
purchase flow to be contextual. You want it
to be fast and you want it to be simple. So

148
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,250
we did just that.
In addition to that we made it a lot faster.

149
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,649
So in this particular client release that
came out a few weeks ago we have seen a 35%

150
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:02,540
drop in latency.
In addition to that we're seeing really good

151
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,040
user feedback and we're seeing a pick up in
conversion as well.

152
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,279
Now, let's shift gears to costs. We've heard
a lot from you around accounting and back

153
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,040
office. And if you're a small developer you
might not worry too much about this, but for

154
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,029
our large partners it was a big problem. You
couldn't get your reports on a timely basis,

155
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,279
you couldn't get them programmatically out
of our database, and so we've done just that.

156
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,480
So with the rollout of the Google Wallet merchant
center, now -- if you don't have it you should

157
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,810
get it in a few weeks. You will be able to
use a very simple script to download all of

158
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,480
your monthly reports and ingest them into
your back end and do whatever you want with

159
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,279
them, most likely reconcile.
The other aspect is support costs. And the

160
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:51,199
thing about support costs is if you look at
the top level costs of lost purchases you

161
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:56,310
might feel that, well, it's bad, but it's
not terrible, but the impact of support goes

162
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,949
well beyond that.
One is there is a cost of the lost sale and

163
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:06,509
there's a fixed cost of supporting that call.
So somebody calls 10 minutes to support that

164
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:11,000
user, that's a lot of money, but the worst
part is you've acquired that buyer with a

165
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,420
certain lifetime value assumption. And what
this does to it is it truncates their lifetime.

166
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:24,009
It cuts it short. So your math as you're looking
at this it's going to -- does it add for me,

167
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:29,410
it really gets messed up.
So support, as little as you might not pay

168
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,120
a lot of attention to it, it's actually critical
to your revenue, your cost and sales. And

169
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,740
what's the exciting metric here is IAB V3.
IAB V3 launched in December and since then

170
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:48,019
Gamevil has seen a drop 90% drop in customer
contact rates for games where they have implemented

171
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:54,620
IAB V3. There was a talk about it, on Wednesday
about it. Please go watch it on YouTube and

172
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,709
thank that person over there for designing
IAB V3.

173
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:04,560
So anyways, basically this is really awesome.
You just need to do it.

174
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,779
So in-app order status API. This is another
big ask from you, which is essentially the

175
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,660
ability for you to take the purchase token
that we send you back and turn around and

176
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,139
verify the status of that purchase.
This is for two reasons. You could do it for

177
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:22,759
either verifying authenticity of the purchase
or just the state.

178
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,980
And we're launching this in a few weeks worldwide.
So all of our developers will have access

179
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:34,060
to this and it should help a lot with reconciling
your purchases and even preventing fraud.

180
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:41,060
Okay. The other thing is in-app billing testing.
You probably heard this already, but we're

181
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:46,040
now simplifying in-app billing testing by
allowing your licensed test accounts, the

182
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,600
one you already configured in the Google Play
developer console to make purchases without

183
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:57,600
being charged. Everything else is the same,
just no more holds, no bins, no delays, none

184
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:01,769
of that bad stuff.
We think this is going to be super exciting,

185
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:06,529
super helpful in streamlining your experience
and testing and making sure that you're not

186
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:10,509
wasting time stuck in those sorts of things.
When you see that message that says this is

187
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:14,720
a test purchase you know that you're not actually
being charged as it says in the remainder

188
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,899
sentence.
All right. So to summarize, so for your sales

189
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,160
we've got 50% of our users now on carrier
billing, we have the Google Play gift cards,

190
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,279
we have promo campaigns and we have a faster,
better purchase flow.

191
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:33,269
For your costs we've got a pragmatic access
to your reports, easy in-app testing, better

192
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:38,970
user experience with in-app billing V3 and
order status check API to prevent fraud as

193
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,059
well as reconcile your purchases.
So this is the summary list of things we've

194
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:50,059
done and already doing in the next few weeks
to help you maximize your income.

195
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:55,350
So looking forward a little bit, you can see
us invest more heavily in Google Play gift

196
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,600
card. We'll push it into our biggest markets
and you will see us continue to do that.

197
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,850
The next thing we'll do is carrier billing.
It's in 12 countries today. See us push that

198
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:12,069
further over the next few months and over
the next 12 months. Those add up.

199
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:15,999
And then the purchase experience, right? So
we've already made a huge improvement in our

200
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:19,290
last release, but we're actually going to
go even further.

201
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,939
The one thing we've done so far -- the one
thing we've done really critically is that

202
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:28,279
we've instrumented the purchase flow so that
we can analyze it and study it and continue

203
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:33,120
to improve it very quickly. So look for us
to do a lot more experimentation, lots more

204
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,279
fine tuning, so when you send us a buyer,
when you get a user to commit to making a

205
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,240
purchase on your app, we want to convert as
many of those as possible unless they change

206
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,790
their mind.
And so look for us to do a lot more of that

207
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:51,129
and look for us to support more forms of payment.
Gift cards are just the beginning.

208
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:57,350
And finally, seller support in more countries.
We're all -- one of the objectives and missions

209
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,100
of all of us is that anyone, anyone around
the world can make a living on Google Play.

210
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,780
And we want to get there. It's taken a long
time. It's slower than we would like it to

211
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,310
be as well, but we do want to get to that
point where anyone around the planet can code

212
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:17,350
an awesome app and make a living out of it.
And we'll get there.

213
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,710
So why is it an exciting year ahead? I think
there's a convergence of a few things for

214
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,339
us on play.
First of all, we've got a global payments

215
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:31,320
reach. We're really getting to the point where
we've got FOBs in many, many countries and

216
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,660
that's going to really help with our conversion.
The next thing is we're seeing higher buyer

217
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,880
engagement, as you've seen in the numbers
before, across the board. Whether it's in-app

218
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,640
subscriptions or paid apps, users are willing
to buy and are willing to pay for the experiences

219
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,940
you're creating, and that's really good news
for us.

220
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:55,810
Finally, we're really putting the final pieces
together for world class commerce infrastructure

221
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:00,150
and developer tools. We want to get you back
to doing the things that you do well and do

222
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,210
best, which is building awesome applications.
We want to take you away from spending time

223
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,600
trying to figure out why your account is blocked
for testing purposes or why you have to download

224
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,590
these reports in some way or the other. We
want to do all of that and make sure you do

225
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,970
what you do best, which is build awesome applications.
That's all for me. I'm going to hand it over

226
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:23,810
to Bob, who is going to cover a few case studies.
>>Bob Meese: Thanks, Ibrahim. And hello, everyone.

227
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,310
So to get the growth rates that we're seeing,
we're clearly doing a lot to help support

228
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:32,460
that growth, but much of the work is also
being done by our developers. So this section

229
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,660
of the presentation we're really focused on
the work of those great developers and we're

230
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,360
focusing specifically on the most commercially
successful developers. And by commercially

231
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,720
successful I mean the developers that are
not just building great products that their

232
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,570
users love that are being installed in large
numbers in many cases, but these are the developers

233
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:55,540
that are making money on Google Play.
I'll focus on two key parts in this section,

234
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,330
so one will just be to help you understand
more about what these developers are doing

235
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:04,930
and then I'd also like to focus on how you
can apply some of these lessons to your own

236
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:10,940
businesses.
So as Ibrahim says, we've seen a 7X increase

237
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,920
in the last year in-app revenue. Signs of
in-app revenue growth are all over the Play

238
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,520
Store. If you look at the top grossing apps
right now, all of the top grossing apps are

239
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,440
free to play.
But with every rule there's always an exception

240
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,900
and so we have a fun game we like to play
called "Where's Minecraft?"

241
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,680
There it is down there at number 22. So we
are not saying you need to push everything

242
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:40,030
free to play. Minecraft is an amazing game.
It's an iconic brand with a very loyal following.

243
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:44,810
We think it will continue to be successful
so we are not asking you to follow the crowd

244
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:50,360
to do that; however, also recognize the dominant
trend towards free to play. It's very important

245
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,970
to recognize that. The bar for success for
a paid title in the top grossing charts is

246
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:00,280
very high.
More than anything, the trend that we see

247
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:07,280
is developers allowing users to defer that
payment decision. We see a three-step funnel

248
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,190
to monetization.
So the first step is really around acquisition.

249
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,990
So this is about expanding this top of the
funnel as wide as you possibly can, getting

250
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,170
as many users as you can to press that install
button.

251
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,570
The install counts on Google Play are public
within a certain band, and just go check out

252
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,760
some of your favorite paid apps and free apps
and check out the large, large difference

253
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,120
in the large number of free installs that
happen on Google Play.

254
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,310
Second, retention.
And we think this is really an underappreciated

255
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,340
part of the funnel. It's part of the omotenashi
that Ibrahim was mentioning earlier. It's

256
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,220
an area where our smartest developers are
spending more and more of their time. And

257
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,430
the thing you need to focus on here is really
on earning, the ability to ask those users

258
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,630
for money. It's not something you can take
for granted.

259
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,910
For example, if I asked all of you to rate
my talk a couple of minutes into it right

260
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,180
now, you might ask for a little bit more time
to see, like, hey, what's this guy actually

261
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,780
going to talk about; right? And the same sort
of principle applies here. How do your users

262
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,820
get into your product, provide value to them,
have them coming back over time. And clearly

263
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,110
we've seen signs that users are more likely
to pay after they've had an experience.

264
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,730
And then finally, obviously pressing that
buy button in monetization. And what we've

265
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:24,860
found, and it's very important, is there's
a lot of differences in terms of when and

266
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:30,440
how developers ask users to pay.
And now I'll do a first case study that introduces

267
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:37,440
these three principles.
So Kiwi is an Android-focused developer lead

268
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,820
by Omar Saddiqui. Omar is actually going to
be joining us for the Office Hours session

269
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,800
afterwards, and Shipwrecked has been their
most successful game on Google Play. It will

270
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,210
also be the subject of the case study in the
following slides.

271
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,580
Kiwi has three other games on Google Play
including Monsterama Park, Brightwood Adventures

272
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,150
and Monsterama Planet, which was recently
released.

273
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:02,920
And when we spoke with them, they said for
acquisition, really invest in your Play Store

274
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,850
page.
It sounds basic, but the little things matter.

275
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:10,700
You see here in the description, "Millions
of players agree that Shipwrecked's Lost Island,

276
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,370
an Editor's Choice app, is one of the top
free games on Android."

277
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,800
In just a few words, they communicate a lot
of powerful principles. It's one of the first

278
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,970
experiences that a user has with your application,
and these words really create a powerful impression.

279
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,050
Also, on the right you see videos. We found
that videos is a very powerful way to communicate

280
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:34,700
the value of your product, and it helps differentiate
you against all of the other products that

281
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,720
do not have videos in the titles.
Second, retention, as we said, is very important.

282
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,770
Here, when you think of retention, thinking
about rewarding those user actions that you

283
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,400
want your users to take. So here on the left,
as you see that, it's very important to have

284
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,370
daily retention, and you see your reward,
a daily login bonus, that rewards those players

285
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:59,460
for taking the actions you want them to take.
On the right, you see a leveling up. You see

286
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,850
the time and effort that your users are spending
in that application being rewarded through

287
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,160
new content and new features being unlocked
and other rewards happening.

288
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:14,430
Further on retention, keeping the content
fresh and unlocking big new content -- in

289
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,630
this case, a full new island, Atlantis in
this case -- allows your users to stay engaged

290
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,990
with the game or the application and explore
all of this new content.

291
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:29,750
Also, you can even think about reinventing
the user experience. When Shipwrecked first

292
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:34,610
launched, it was really focused around exploration
and collection. After launch, they added a

293
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:39,560
trading mechanic which users actually loved.
It was a bit of a risk, but the users love

294
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:46,560
this, and they keep coming back to the game
over and over.

295
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,770
On the topic of monetization, we found that
merchandising really matters. I think this

296
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,700
monkey is great here. He is pointing out this
"arrrsome" deal if you can't see the little

297
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,020
text there. The 24 gold for $2.99, who can
beat that? You can see below it, you can go

298
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,240
to the full store but why not pull out one
of the most attractive offers and put it right

299
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:12,240
there to make it easy for users to buy.
And so as you saw with Kiwi, acquisition is

300
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,440
about improving your placed lower page. Retention
is about rewarding the user behaviors that

301
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,920
you want to promote and about reinventing
the user experience. And monetization, merchandising

302
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,460
matters.
But it's not just enough to go linearly through

303
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,070
this. What we're seeing the most successful
developers on Google Play do is they create

304
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,420
a virtuous cycle by feeding back to acquisition
several different ways.

305
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,260
So those developers that are able to find
success and make money on Google Play can

306
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,710
reinvest those earnings through paid user
acquisition to feel for future growth of their

307
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:49,480
products.
Similarly, those developers that have a great

308
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,800
number of retained users can cross promote
those users, especially the developers that

309
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:59,100
have multiple titles, back into acquisition.
And then finally, those developers that are

310
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,200
fortunate enough to reach the top list, that
becomes a self-fulfilling cycle. You need

311
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,450
a lot of installs to get there, but you get
a lot of installs from being there.

312
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,570
And now I'll talk about some of these concepts
with the other case studies.

313
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,240
The second one we'll introduce today is DeNA,
and the game we'll mostly focus on is their

314
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,790
successful game, Blood Brothers. They have
a couple other hit titles including Marvel,

315
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:26,650
War of Heroes and Rage of Bahamut, which was
a clear breakout hit through 2012. DeNA also

316
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:33,270
has six other games in the top 100 top grossing.
So because they have so many successful titles,

317
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:37,740
they really focus on cross promotion. In this
case, I was playing Blood Brothers on the

318
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,510
left. While I was playing, I received this
promotion, "Play Marvel and receive 50 Mobacoin."

319
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:47,970
It's a way for them to target a very attractive
user base, the users who are playing their

320
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:54,660
existing games, and use them to acquire them
for the new games they're launching.

321
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,370
It's also important for retention to provide
very clear objectives. The central objective

322
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:03,480
in the game Blood Brothers is a card collection
mechanic. It's all around strengthening your

323
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,190
characters, which they call familiars.
All of the core game loops in the game support

324
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:14,120
this core objective. It's a very powerful
thing. They focus you on a single core objective,

325
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,970
and then you have a game loop of adventuring,
battling, leveling up your characters, all

326
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,290
feeling back into that one objective of strengthening
your characters.

327
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,820
Even as you add more complexity to the game,
when you battle and you win, you capture a

328
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,120
character, there's a variety of ways you can
combine these characters all back towards

329
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,480
that central objective of strengthening your
characters.

330
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,760
And one thing that's particularly worth calling
out is DeNA success with events. So events

331
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,790
are variations on the standard game play that
happen for a very limited amount of time,

332
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:50,040
a fixed duration, that provide important rewards.
And in this case, they provide rare characters

333
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,080
which are extremely valuable within the context
of the game, again feeding back to strengthening

334
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,090
your characters. But the importance here is
creating that sense of urgency through having

335
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,610
a limited time window and providing something
that's very valuable.

336
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:10,610
And that combination is very powerful.
You say how powerful is it? The monetization

337
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,590
in that game actually doubles on an average-revenue-per-user
basis during these events. So there's a clear

338
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:25,600
payoff to finding the ways to make your game
work for users, to create that sense of urgency,

339
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,200
to give the players that great experience,
to provide a slightly different game experience,

340
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,820
to give them a different way to interact with
other users. And clearly there's a financial

341
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:39,820
reward for doing this within the game.
Next one I'd like to talk about is Kabam,

342
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:46,090
another very successful developer who moved
just last year from the Web over to mobile.

343
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:50,750
So in Kabam's case, we're going to focus their
case study on Kings of the Camelot, Battle

344
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,120
for the North.
They also have several other successful titles

345
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,840
on Google Play, including The Hobbit, Arcane
Empires, and the soon to release Fast & Furious

346
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,450
6.
One of the lessons from Kabam was always be

347
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:10,260
testing. Kabam focuses on core gaming users.
Core gaming users monetize much better than

348
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,540
your average user, and as a result of being
able to earn that revenue, they're able to

349
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,660
reinvest those earnings back into paid user
acquisition. In this case here, they're doing

350
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:24,270
a split test on several different campaigns.
On the campaign on the left, you can see a

351
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,390
campaign focused around characters and concept.
On the campaign on the right, you can see

352
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,020
a campaign much more focused around a realistic
depiction of game play.

353
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,610
Kabam is always testing, and so based on the
relative success of each of these campaigns,

354
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,630
they can add more resources to one, take them
away from another, and be very flexible in

355
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,680
growing their overall user base.
In terms of retention, as I mentioned, Kabam

356
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,650
recently came from Web over to mobile, and
they quickly realized a difference in those

357
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,320
users.
The mobile sessions were much more frequent.

358
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,570
There were many more sessions through the
course of the day, but they were also shorter,

359
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,880
and so one of the first things they did was
change the way they did the content refreshes

360
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,490
to make them more frequent.
You can also see visually depicted here, on

361
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:13,310
the left, that's the Web game, and there's
a very rich landscape of game-play elements.

362
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:17,230
Many of the major elements are spread further
apart. It's really designed to be played with

363
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,650
a mouse and keyboard, obviously. And on the
right, you have a much more streamlined game

364
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:26,040
experience on mobile. Many of the user actions
are able to be taken right from your thumb

365
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:32,590
in a very easy way.
Now, monetization. Kabam really focuses on

366
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:38,230
providing visual consistency. As I said, it's
really important how you ask your users for

367
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,850
payment. In their case, they want to minimize
any confusion, and so here, through all three

368
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:49,850
screens, you can see the exact identical presentation
throughout.

369
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,740
The final case study today will be on Pandora.
Pandora is a company that's extremely well-known.

370
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:01,360
It hardly needs an introduction. The leading
Internet radio service.

371
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,720
Kabam is one of those lucky few apps that
has reached the top of the lists, and so from

372
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,840
there -- it's hard to get there, but when
you do, it's quite powerful. But what I really

373
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,840
want to focus on with Pandora that's a recent
change that they've made is around monetization.

374
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,530
And so as Ibrahim alluded to earlier is you
can see in the chart here, something changed

375
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,790
in February. And what was that change?
So the thing that changed in February is Pandora

376
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:31,010
implemented our in-app billing subscriptions.
Previously, before that time, while the revenue

377
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:35,180
and payments were much flatter, you had to
go from your mobile device over to Pandora

378
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,150
on Web and sign up for subscription there
to be able to use the subscriptions on mobile.

379
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,890
By reducing all of that payment friction,
by allowing a user to purchase directly from

380
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,170
the mobile device, they saw a big bump in
overall payments.

381
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:53,720
But it doesn't stop there. It gets even better
the next month, because what happened here?

382
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:00,720
So at this time, Pandora still allowed users
40 free hours of mobile listening per month.

383
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:06,350
But for those users who reached those 40 free
hours and still wanted more, Pandora asked

384
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:11,850
them to pay. And that's what really allows
this. And omotenashi is the theme. It's finding

385
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,770
that mix of you have users. You're providing
a great value to users. For free you're providing

386
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:21,960
40 free hours of mobile listening per month,
but yet there's so many users who want to

387
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,850
help you build your business, they love your
product so much they're happy to pay at that

388
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:33,970
time.
So in summary, when you're thinking about

389
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,810
acquisition, think about improving your Play
Store page and investing in your Play Store

390
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:43,250
page. Consider cross promotion, especially
with multiple different applications.

391
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:49,600
For those applications that are making money,
reinvest those earnings for paid user acquisition.

392
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,460
And of course everybody wants to get at the
top of the charts.

393
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,900
For retention, really think about rewarding
the user actions that you're trying to promote.

394
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:06,900
And consider reinventing your user experience.
It's really important to provide clear objectives

395
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:15,630
to users, and to support those objectives
with the overall user experience.

396
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:21,220
Design for mobile. It's important, and users
will notice.

397
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,460
In (indiscernible) monetization the way that
you merchandise within your products on mobile

398
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:32,460
matters. If you change new game play mechanics,
users will notice and you can drive huge success.

399
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:40,980
Present a consistent visual experience. And
finally, there's still -- there's developers

400
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,780
that have charts like this, and we're looking
forward to even more of these in the coming

401
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:49,360
year.
And so that concludes the prepared part for

402
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,620
our talk. As we mentioned, following this
talk we'll be taking Q&A in the Office Hour

403
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,240
areas. We'd also like to point out a few other
--

404
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,550
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: We have time to do
the questions.

405
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,730
>>Bob Meese: Yeah, we can do a few now, but
we'd like to specifically point out a few

406
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,400
we thought were particularly noteworthy and
valuable for your time.

407
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,860
And then most importantly, we'd like to say
thank you. We would like to thank you all

408
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,500
of you for your time today. We would like
to thank some of the developers who were part

409
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,550
of this. I see Kabam here in the front row.
Thank you guys very much. And then thank you

410
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:23,130
to all of the developers on Google Play. It's
been an amazing past year, but the future,

411
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:30,130
I believe, is even brighter.
>>> I had one quick question. Can I ask now?

412
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:36,980
[ Applause ]
>>> You said something about the carrier billing,

413
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,110
apart from the gift card. What is that carrier
billing?

414
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,100
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: So carrier billing
is basically the ability for a user to put

415
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:50,120
their purchases on a monthly bill. So the
same bill you get from your provider, you

416
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,090
just put all your purchases on that bill.
And so it just adds up to that.

417
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,230
>>> So if you want to do international calling
or something, is it used for that or for what?

418
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,810
>>Bob Meese: It's just for buying in-app products.
So when you're, let's say, playing a game

419
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:04,610
or you're even subscribing to Pandora, you
can put your Pandora subscription on your

420
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,870
monthly phone bill.
>>> Oh, that way.

421
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,560
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: Yeah.
>>> Hello. I'm having a little bit of time

422
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,530
just judging business models and evaluating
business models when I'm thinking about developing

423
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:21,750
apps. Like, for example, you're talking about
7x improvements, 5x improvements, 2x improvements,

424
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,889
and all that sounds great but zero times five
is still zero.

425
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,129
So the question is what does it mean to be
in the hundred top-grossing apps? Is there

426
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:35,429
any charts of, like, revenue, actual dollars
per month if you're a certain percentile of

427
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:40,919
your app in that top-grossing list? I'm having
a really hard time finding useful data in

428
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:43,399
that direction.
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: So I would say that's

429
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:49,800
probably like partner data. We generally can't
share information like that about how much

430
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,379
revenue people make in our different rankings.
It varies a lot depending what type of application

431
00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:00,030
is up there. Clearly, if you have a $9.99
a month subscription and you are at the top

432
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,530
gross end, that gets you up there faster.
It varies a lot, so it's hard for us to give

433
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:09,680
a firm number there.
>>> Even if it's completely anonymized statistic,

434
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,630
like if your app is in the top 2% you can
expect, I don't know, $3,000 a month?

435
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,240
>>Bob Meese: You want more just what is the
data behind it.

436
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,790
>>> Just very rough guidelines. Can I expect
to make 30 bucks a month, 3,000 bucks a month,

437
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,400
300,000 bucks a month if I have a top 2% app?
It's just really hard to get a feeling for

438
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,820
this.
>>Bob Meese: Sure. I mean, if you're interested

439
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,960
enough, there's data that's out there. A number
of the developers are publicly traded, and

440
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,550
so there you can get a sense of what their
revenues are.

441
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:41,130
As Ibrahim said, it's challenging for us to
share our partners' data. We all have confidentiality

442
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,010
agreements.
We've tried as much as possible through this

443
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:47,220
presentation to be as open, and over time
we've become more and more open. But if you

444
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,300
want to talk more, we can find you at Office
Hours.

445
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:54,770
>>> Okay. Thanks.
>>> Now with version three of in-app billing,

446
00:35:54,770 --> 00:36:00,960
how soon can we expect to be able to do multiple
purchases of a single item? For instance,

447
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,370
purchase 200 tokens for two bucks and have
Google Play handle the maintenance of that?

448
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:13,420
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: So that's (indiscernible)
configuring one skew that equals 200 tokens.

449
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,760
>>> Yeah.
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: It's not in the immediate

450
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,840
roadmap, but it's something we've talked about
in the past. So I'll take that back to the

451
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,350
team and see if we can prioritize it.
And the use case, is it just a maintenance

452
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,700
issue or --
>>> I mean, I can do it right now, but I'll

453
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,950
have to build my own server infrastructure
to manage the consumption of those 200 tokens.

454
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,780
So what I'd really like to do is allow the
user to purchase 200 tokens, and then as they

455
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,870
use them in game, I just tell Google Play
consume one token, consume one token.

456
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,650
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: Okay. Yeah, that makes
sense.

457
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:53,100
>>> Hi. Do you have any tip or -- what's better?
To enlighten the pro app or do a light app

458
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,530
in a purchase?
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: I'm sorry; I didn't

459
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:01,200
get that.
>>Bob Meese: You're saying whether you do

460
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,790
two different applications or whether you
do a free app with an in-app purchase?

461
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,630
>>> Yeah.
>>Bob Meese: One error we found is whenever

462
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:11,360
developers have two different apps, it creates
a lot of overhead. So some of the general

463
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,500
guidance is simplifying, finding one application
to invest all of your resources behind. Otherwise,

464
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,120
it can lead to confusion.
So the general best practice is invest in

465
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,630
a single app, especially for smaller developers.
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: And the upgrade experience

466
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:27,200
is not as nice; right? Because you have to
get them to go install a different app and

467
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,850
buy another app versus just in-app purchase
any upgrade, you unlock the new content immediately

468
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,329
in the app.
>>> Thanks.

469
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:42,329
>>> Yeah, I was wondering if you are considering
doing promo codes for paid apps? And are you

470
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:48,340
also considering affiliate programs?
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: Yeah, those are things

471
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:53,130
that we've looked into as well. We've launched
the promotional campaigns in terms of promo

472
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:59,990
codes for money, so you can actually get $50,
as I mentioned, in the earlier Galaxy S3 campaign.

473
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:05,690
We're looking as well into being able to allow
developers to issue promo codes and have them

474
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,849
redeemed by -- whether it's the press or reviewers
or whomever it is. Yes.

475
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:14,570
>>> And what about the affiliate programs?
Do you -- Are you going to launch that soon?

476
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:19,340
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: I don't think it will
launch soon, but we'll definitely talk about

477
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:25,690
them, especially in the content side of Google
Play. But we'll definitely take that back

478
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,250
to the team.
>>> All right. Thanks.

479
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:35,340
>>> How are you defining what is a top app?
Is it, you know, the top sales that day? That

480
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,520
week? That month?
And are you also doing any editorializing

481
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,870
around that where you're just putting in things
like you like?

482
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:45,470
>>Bob Meese: No, no. All the top lists are
straight up algorithmic, and there, it's revenue

483
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:49,970
transacted through Google Play, and it's generally
over a week time frame.

484
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,809
>>> One week time frame?
>>Bob Meese: Yep.

485
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:55,190
>>> Same thing across free/paid apps -- or
free apps, paid apps, et cetera?

486
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:59,150
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: There was a talk earlier
about discovery that Ankit Jain gave. It's

487
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,140
one of those we've highlighted, and that was
actually all about that, all about discovery

488
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:10,140
and top lists and those sorts of things.
>>> You had an example about the kind of creative

489
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,750
that works well in the Play Store and what
your listing should contain. Do you have similar

490
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:21,280
recipes or insights about how to do paid user
acquisition, which you also briefly mentioned?

491
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,940
What works in paid user acquisition?
>>Bob Meese: We observe it. We don't make

492
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:30,100
recommendations. There's a part of Google's
business which is fully separate from us with,

493
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,130
you know, the ads business, which focuses
more on that.

494
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:39,070
For us, the conversation today was more around
observing more so than recommending, but there's

495
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,870
plenty of other smart people, either other
developers that are out there that are doing

496
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:47,110
it or the vendors themselves, that I'm sure
will be happy to educate you.

497
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:53,040
>>> If I have a paid application with low
download numbers, one way I could boost those

498
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:00,040
is to offer it free for a period of time,
say a week or a month or even a day. Is that

499
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,550
still not possible, and why?
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: Converting a free app

500
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,790
to a paid app.
>>> Other way. I have a paid app now. I want

501
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,560
to make it free for a day or a week.
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: And then bring it back.

502
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,650
>>> Mm-hmm.
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: We'll have to take

503
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,990
that back to the Developer Console team. That's
more of how do we manage the skew and what

504
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:25,440
types of skews are out there, and like each
product and categorization, but I'll bring

505
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,550
that back to the team.
>>Bob Meese: And I think that's it. Our time

506
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,720
is up. So we really appreciate your questions.
Please, follow up with --

507
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,420
>>Ibrahim Elbouchikhi: Yeah, Office Hours.
Thanks.

508
