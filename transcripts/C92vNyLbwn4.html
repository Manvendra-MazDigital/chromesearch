<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="35"><span class="speakerName">Anna Patterson</span>: So I'm here to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">tell a little bit of hacker </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">stories from the trench, and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">think with a main theme of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">perseverance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="48">I saw that the ENIAC </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">programmers, how they got a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">circuit diagram in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">order to program. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="55">My first programming job out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">school was for the F-15E, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">and we would test our software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">the best you can on something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">that wasn't flying. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="68">And then we'd invariably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">need to put in patches. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="72">And just like the ENIAC, you had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">to toggle in the program. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="76">So it was very scary since </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">people's lives were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">depending on it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="82">But also I was thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">about how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">source control has evolved. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="89">Of course, my first programs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">in high school </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">were on punch cards. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="92">But at home, I was really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">fortunate that my dad brought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">home a Commodore Pet computer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">and he encouraged us to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">experiment and write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">a program on it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="101">And I wrote a really, really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">horrible, terrible video game, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">and it only had 8K of memory. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="109">So I stored the program state </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">in the corners so they were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">flashing weirdly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="118">And, you know, I guess it was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">standard trick, I found out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">much later. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="122">But I was from the suburbs of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">Saint Louis, so I wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">really part of a burgeoning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">hacker community. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="129">I eventually got my PhD in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">computer science at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">University of Illinois, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">Champaign. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="134">And then I became a research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">faculty member for John </span><span class="line" data-startTime="137">McCarthy, the founder of AI. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="140">And I see several people here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">who know me really well, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">so you'll appreciate when I say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">that John McCarthy made me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">do something how hard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">that must have been. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="152">So he made me look into this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">area called phenomenal data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">mining, where you're given </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">facts and relations, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">you're given a big data set. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="162">Big was very small </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">in those days. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="165">And then when you learn new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">correlations, you can explain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">these new correlations in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">terms of underlying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">phenomenon. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="172">So that's where it got its name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">and that technique is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">still in use. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="177">But everybody was leaving the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">department to start companies, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">so we were pretty much like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">the last ones out when the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">lights were turning off. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="186">And I co-founded, in 1998, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">a web mining company. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="191">Because the web was so big at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">5 million pages, we thought, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">how are people going to be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">to get around this thing? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">And so we had an idea to make a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">automatic taxonomy and kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">of lead people to what questions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">were answerable on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">the web and what ones weren't. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="207">Because in those days, trust </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">me, there weren't really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">recipes on the web, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">but the taxonomy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">around Linux was deep. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="215">So we got angel funded to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">this just in time for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">dot-com crash. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="222">And so I tried to figure out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">what my other passion was, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">I said, mobile is just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">about to take off. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="231">So I moved into the mobile area </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">in 1999, just in time for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">the telco crash. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="237">So after killing two industries, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">I was actually &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">I had a one-year-old, and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">was four months pregnant. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="246">And of course, I was unemployed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">and I was actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">living in Pavni's guest room, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">who's in the front row. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="252">And so the doctor said, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">you know, you need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">to be on bed rest. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="257">And I said, have you ever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">heard of programming? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">And he hadn't. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="261">And I said, it's a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">like bed rest. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="266">So I volunteered at the Internet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">Archive, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">have snapshots of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">web over time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="272">So as such, especially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">in 2001, it was much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">bigger than the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="277">It had 30 billion web pages, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">the live web at the time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">maybe had 5 billion. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="282">So I did a history-based search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="282">engine that launched at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">like, 12 billion pages, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">could look at how terms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">change over time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="292">So you could dial back to 1997 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">and search for a term like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">"Clinton," and you'd see all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">these co-occurring terms in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">graph and how they changed over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">time, and it was very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">presidential. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="303">Dialing it up to 1999, it wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">quite as presidential. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="308">And then moving forward to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">today, everything is about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">Hillary Clinton, if you search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">for Clinton, when you look at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">the popularity of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">things on the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="317">So it was a really interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">project, and I was doing it as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">a volunteer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="322">And four days after it launched, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">various companies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">wanted to talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">acquiring it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="326">So I go from volunteer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">stay-at-home mom, to the world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">of corp dev. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="333">So that was really fun. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="335">So that's how I wound </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">up at Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="338">And at Google, I really wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">to unlock some global and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">local information. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="344">One of our examples was about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">these small towns in Germany </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">with their local Oktoberfests </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">and how that information was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">really important to them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="353">And we weren't quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">big enough to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">everything to everyone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="359">And so at Google, we evolve our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">system so just when one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">system launches, we would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">start a new one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="366">So when one such system just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">launched, I came up with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">idea for TeraGoogle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="372">And speaking of thinking big, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">probably 95% of people said, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">why would we ever need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">a search system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">for a trillion pages? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">And of course, the founders </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">were like, is that all? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">So at the time, it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">very cost efficient. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="388">When it launched, it was about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">50 times cheaper than our main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">line index. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="392">And at the same time, some of my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">web ranking team went off, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">and they shipped one of our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">early deep-learning projects, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">which was around ads broadening, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">like once you bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">on one keyword, what other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">keywords do you &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">might be interesting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="408">So after having my fourth child, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">I did what everybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">does when they have four </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">kids, and they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">on maternity leave. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="414">I decided to start a company. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="418">So I started a company &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">Cuil. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="420">And we really wanted to bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">like a really high-res, rich </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">experience to people with high </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">bandwidth, and a really low </span><span class="line" data-startTime="428">bandwidth experience to people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="428">who had feature phones. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="433">And so what we did around the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">low bandwidth experience is we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">summarized things so that a fact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">that appeared on tons of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">web pages was on top in kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">of paragraph format with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">bunch of references down to much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">rarer facts that had much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">fewer references. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="452">So after Cuil, I returned to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">Google where I became one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">the first 100 engineers in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">Android, because this time, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">was pretty sure the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">mobile revolution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">was going to happen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="462">But it wasn't a sure thing. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="465">I mean, at that time, Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">had sold 40 million phones. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="470">And of course, today it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">announced that Android now has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">900 million. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="475">I was part of the team that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">helped launch Google Play on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">Play tablets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="480">And very recently, like two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">weeks ago, we shipped a native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">search architecture onto the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">phone to index all the local </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">data so that when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">offline, you can have access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">to it, and some data never </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">leaves your phone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="494">So a lot of people say, wait, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">Google's so good at search. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="498">Why didn't you just compile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="498">the thing and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">put it on the phone? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">Well, the phone is kind of like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">my early Commodore Pet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">computer, not quite as bad, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">but compared to a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="507">data center, it is. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="508">And each of the programs can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">only have 20 meg resident in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">memory and the executable is 500 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">meg as hard constraints. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="517">So trust me when I say that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">Google search system, its </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">executable is bigger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">than 500 meg. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="526">So when we look at this system, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">because of the success </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">of Android as a compute cluster, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">it's actually over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">500 exahertz of computing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">power, which is way more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">powerful than the human brain. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="540">So last autumn, I moved over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">to our new AI area, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">recently Ray Kurzweil </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">joined us. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="547">And he says that the AIs that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">humans create are going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">leave the Earth at light speed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">and populate the universe. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="554">So we're not just working on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">most important project on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">planet Earth, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">in the universe. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="562">So I do want to encourage the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">Techmakers out there, women </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">and men, to really reach for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">stars and use technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">to help shape the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="572">Technology is a very powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">platform in order to help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">people and enable change. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="577">Thank you. </span></p>
