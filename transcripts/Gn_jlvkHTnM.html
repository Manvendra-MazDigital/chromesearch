<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3">Hi, my name is Nick, and I am the product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3">manager for Google Chrome's extension system. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="9">Today, I'd like to show you how to publish </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">your extension in the Google Chrome Extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">gallery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="15">Here on my desktop, I've got a new extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">that I've created. The first thing I'd like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">to do is check that the manifest has a title, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">a short description, and an icon. It's very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">important to pay attention to these, as they'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">influence how likely people are to pick my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">extension in the gallery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="34">Next I'm going to zip up this folder. There </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">are a number of free programs out there that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">will do this for you. The gallery will require </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">me to upload this zip file, not a packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">extension. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="46">Next, I go to the gallery site at chrome.google.com/extensions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="46">I click the developer link here in the left </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">navigation, which takes me to my developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">dashboard. Here I can see all the extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">that I've previously uploaded. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="65">I click add new item, and the first thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">I have to do is upload the zip file I created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">earlier. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="72">At this point, I get taken to the edit page, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">where I can enter a more detailed description. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="78">I've already prepared this, so I'm just going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">to paste it here. I can also add a support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">link, which is very important to avoid users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">posting bug reports in my reviews. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="91">I'm also going to add some nice screenshots. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="91">Again, the nicer my extension looks, the bigger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">the chance that someone will install it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="99">I can also specify a youtube video. Ideally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">this would be a screencast of my extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">in action. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="106">Finally, when all is ready, I hit publish </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">and get taken to a preview page. Here I double-check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">my information and confirm. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="115">In just a few minutes, my extension is live </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">in the Google Chrome Extension gallery! I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">hope to see yours there soon too. </span></p>
