<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Hi, everyone. Hello. My name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">is Paul Irish and we're going to dive into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">the Chrome DevTools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="7">Since Google I/O last year there's been a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">lot of work put into DevTools. I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">show just a little bit of some of the features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">that have landed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="14">So the way that we're going to go into this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">we're going to dive into some of the improvements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">made to authoring, just building out and working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="24">with the tools to iterate on your &mdash; your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="24">application, your site; dive into what that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="28">looks like on mobile; and then dive into some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="28">of the ground-breaking performance features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">that really change how you can get insight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">and understand how to fix performance situations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">with your app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="39">All right. So first stop, I want to play a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">little bit of this video. This is Remy Sharp, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">and a bit ago he made a short video on kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">of how he never even leaves the DevTools when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">he does development. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="51"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So what I'm going to do here is just make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">a feature and just hopefully you already know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">about this and you can just kind of stick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">your mouse cursor straight in and we can just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">go to blue and if I hit "command S" &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="59"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: So what he's showing here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">actually two separate things. One is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">he has live edit in the JavaScript. Any changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">he's making in the JavaScript are immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">patched up to V8 and it starts evaluating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">the new code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="74">And the second feature, separately, is he's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">making these changes back to disk and saving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">them so that they persist to disk. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="82">We like this. We think this is really powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">and if you've seen the Brent Victor talk, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">having a &mdash; an environment where you can iterate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">live against your production application that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">you're building really changes the whole development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">lifecycle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="96">So today, I'm going to share with you something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">called "workspaces." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">Actually, I have a problem with this slide. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="101">First of all, there's a capital "O." Okay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="107">One second. I'm just going to fix this. Okay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="107">Let's see. We're going to go down here and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">then actually the styling is not totally keen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">&mdash; I'm not &mdash; we could make this better, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">think. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="118">I'm going to add some text shadow, probably. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="122">Let's give it some of this. Yeah, it's like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">a little glow. I like that. Wow! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">Maybe change up the color. Let's see. I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">just make it a little bit lighter. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="139">And bump the font size. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="139">Ooh. Line height. Sheesh. Okay, okay, okay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="145">1.1 sounds about good. Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="145">All right. So I've made these changes. I should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">probably, you know, copy them. Or maybe I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">go over here and I could copy them over from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">here, go back to sublime and see we're in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">my default CSS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="161">Section, line height. Wait. Um... okay, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">&mdash; let's see if I can get this on screen at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">the same time here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="172">Okay. Yeah. Sure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="176">So, uh, line height and colors. Brighten that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="182">And let's see. Ahh. Then I have a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">of box shadow. 10px, black, seems good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="198">Come down here, and what you're seeing, actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">&mdash; so all my changes that I'm making in styling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204"> &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="206"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: All my changes that I'm making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">here in the style panel are persistent to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">disk and I immediately have them over here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="213">Now, I can make my edits here or I can come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">over here and actually just kill this box </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">shadow and, you know, tweak my line height. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="225">But I have the editability in both places. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="225">I can also come back, say, for instance, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">&mdash; to sublime. Maybe I'm going to make my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">change down here, so instead &mdash; I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">to kill the box shadow down here and we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">change the color over to indigo. That one's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">been &mdash; I like that style. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="243">Come back, and immediately my change comes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">up in the DevTools. No refresh. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="248">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="253"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: So I'm really keen on this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">and I think it's really powerful, but it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">backed up by a bit of &mdash; a bit of work. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259"> &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">Ah. One last thing. The capitalization that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">I didn't even get to. So let's take a look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">at that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="270">So these are HTML styles &mdash; HTML slides, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">I'm using markdown to actually generate them, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">so if I want to change this, I should probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">edit my markdowns. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="284">So what I'm going to do is just hit command </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">"O" inside here, bring up my slides for markdown, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">and inside here &mdash; so this is just my markdown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">source. I'm going to change the capitalization, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">hit "save," hit "refresh," and we got my changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">in place here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="302">So this is really powerful and we're really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">excited about what we can do here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="307">Workspaces allows you to map what's coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">into the browser to the local filesystem, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">so in this case, I have &mdash; this is the workspace </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">for my slides. I have the entire local filesystem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">and that's been mapped by DevTools to what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">coming in the browser. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="325">So I can edit my JavaScript, my CSS, my HTML, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">my markdown files. Even the DevTools engineering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">team who is building this edits their &mdash; their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">C++ bindings directly inside the DevTools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="336">The style changes that I'm making inside the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">style pane persist. I can edit. The changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">are kept. I can undo, redo any of the changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">in here, which is just command "Z," command </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">shift "Z," and this is great because I'm able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">to maintain my context for styling. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="353">So I don't have to be bopping in and out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">a different editor to make these changes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="359">I can make them all here in one place. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="364">All right. So this is looking pretty good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="364">I'm going to move on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="369">Last year at I/O, we asked everyone what features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">you wanted inside of DevTools, and one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">the top things that people wanted was support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">for Sass. Because you're editing in Sass, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">you're authoring there, but then in the DevTools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">you're seeing CSS and you kind of need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">manually map back and forth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="385">So this is something that we've been working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">on, and I wanted to show you how this works. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="389">So I'm going to bring up a little copy of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">HTML5 Please. This is a site with a small </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">node back end but the styles are written in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">Sass, and we want to take a look at how that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">works. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="403">So let's take this little views badge right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">here. Now normally, if I am looking at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">styling, I'm going to see something like this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">So we got the green box shadow, border right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">and background. We're all using this green, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">and in fact, it's using just a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">darker as it goes down. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="426">Now, I can click over to see my CSS, but as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">I said, this is compiled, so &mdash; from my Sass, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">so it's not very helpful. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="432">So let's turn on Sass debugging. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="436">So when I go into DevTool settings &mdash; I like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">using the question mark for this, a quick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">little shortcut &mdash; go into experiments, turn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">on Sass debugging, and now I'm just going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">to refresh the page so that this is all looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="447">And now the first difference that you're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">to see is that right here we're listing the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">original place inside the Sass file where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">this was &mdash; where this was found. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="456">So I can click over to that and we're looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">inside my Sass file where this &mdash; where this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">selector was found. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="463">So we got my use, and it looks like we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">applying a mix-in inside here. Okay. Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="466">But actually I want to change this green, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="471">so I'm going to have to do a little bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="471">hunting. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="473">So as I hold down the command key, I actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">get a little bit of visual feedback. As I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">hover, I get these little underlines, so I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">going to try clicking "background." We're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">going to jump immediately into where that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">mix-in was defined. I can see my background, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">my box shadow, my border right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="488">All right. But yeah, we got this color. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">comes in. It's getting darkened and I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">to edit the color. So let's do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="500">I'm going to command-click on the color itself </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">and over here we dive into the variables of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">that CSS file where the color was actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">defined. My cursor goes right to the definition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="511">So now let's see. I will probably want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">make a change. As I said, I'm really into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">indigo lately. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="518">All right. I'm going to hit command "S." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">Now, one of the cool things that we have set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">up is that if you have &mdash; if you have a Sass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">watch set up, so you're watching, you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">the &mdash; the daemon sitting there waiting for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">any changes to disk, we can actually use that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">and then as new changes come into disk, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">can apply them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="544">So let me give this a shot. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="546">I'm going to come back in here and make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">that that setting is on. Okay. Autoreload </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">CSS upon Sass save. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="553">Come over and it looks like &mdash; there we go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="564">Nice! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="564">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="566"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: All right. So I can make any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">changes to my Sass right here inside the DevTools, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="575">change the color. Maybe I'm &mdash; I should go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="575">back to that green. It's probably better than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">all these changes. Just hit command "S" and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">due to workspaces, as we saw before, my local </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">development folder is mapped to what's coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">in over the wire from local host, and so my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">changes are saved back to disk and my watch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">picks it back up and DevTools takes care of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">refreshing the styles right inside the browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="596">So this is really cool. We have full traceability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">from any UI, from selectors, properties, variables, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">back to the mix-ins, the functions, the places </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">in the original sources where they were defined. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="608">And the fact that this is powered by sourcemaps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">&mdash; you've heard about sourcemaps for JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="612">This is the exact same technology, only used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">for CSS, and the DevTools team contributed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">the sourcemap implementation into the core </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">Sass compiler to enable this functionality. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="620">And we have the automatic reloaded style sheet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">so as you edit inside the DevTools, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">just keep going and see the changes as they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">come in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="630">All right. So these two features combined </span><span class="line" data-startTime="634">really kind of change things. It really means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="634">that DevTools can become my editor. I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">style as I type, whether it's in CSS or Sass. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="641">These changes can be persisted to disk because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">I'm mapping them right into my local folders. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="647">My &mdash; inside JavaScript I can re-evaluate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">that &mdash; re-evaluate it on the fly with live </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">edit and where I author is where I debug. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="657">It's really powerful and we're excited about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">what we can do now with this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="661">All right. Now that we've covered kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">taking a look at giving you more productive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">tools when authoring sites, let's bring that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">to mobile. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="669">All right. So last year we talked about remote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">debugging Chrome on Android. Powerful stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="676">But it does require a bit of command line </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">hackery.

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="683"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Cool. Yeah. That's great.

See this guy? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="720">We're just going to click on this guy and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">start up ADB.

Let me go over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="802">to Timeline and I'm just going to record a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">quick Timeline as I scroll the page. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">And there we go. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="817"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: It's really powerful and we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">excited about having this &mdash; the full functionality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">of the DevTools available so conveniently. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="829">And this is not just the full functionality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="829">of the DevTools, but any Chrome Extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">or DevTools extensions that you want. Before, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">you didn't have available. Now, say, for instance, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">you want to run Google PageSpeed against your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">situation on the phone. Right here &mdash; my phone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">is actually still on 3G, and so I'm able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">understand in real network conditions what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">Google PageSpeed is going to tell me. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="848">But there is still a problem, so let's say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="854">&mdash; switch back here and I come over to this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="854">file. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="859">So before I was debugging, what, HTML5 Please </span><span class="line" data-startTime="859">and it was coming over local host, and sometimes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">I'm not able to have that available on my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">phone. Just doesn't come up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="873">So we thought we could probably fix this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="873">too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="877">So if I have this up here, I'm going to inspect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">this target and go into the DevTools settings, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">and you'll see here a new setting that's called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">port forwarding. And so now I can just add </span><span class="line" data-startTime="890">in I want to map over port 9000, get that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="890">going, and we'll come back over here and refresh </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">and we're good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="901">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="905"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: So this is fantastic because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">I can even use the functionality that I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">showing you before.

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="944"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: All right. So I've just connected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">with &mdash; with really &mdash; with a lot of ease </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">to here. I have workspaces, I have Sass debugging, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">I have a lot of power, and I can focus my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="957">development in improving this mobile experience, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="957">which is really fantastic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="961">All right. So no command line setup, see all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">your debug targets in about inspect, great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">feature set available, everything that's on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">desktop is available for Chrome on Android, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="975">and port forwarding to make this local development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="975">feedback loop really fantastic and smooth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="980">All right. Now, bringing this back up, I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="980">covered authoring, I've covered what we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">do to make this experience better on mobile. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="988">Now, to dig into performance a little bit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="993">There's fantastic features and I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">cover a few of the brand-new ones. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="998">But the first thing when coming to performance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">is that you've really got to focus on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1002">right priorities, finding your biggest bottlenecks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1002">and focusing on those first. And the Timeline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">is the best tool for this, and I want to show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">this with a good example. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1011">So here I have &mdash; this is like an infographic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">parallax site and what we do as we scroll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">down, we've got this kind of orange circle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">growth, we've got these white little guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1022">that are going to &mdash; physics kind of going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1022">out, we got this kind of section. It's parallax. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1027">It's really an attractive site. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1027">And then down here, a little bit more changes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1033">I'm going to come back up to the top and now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">let's take a look at this inside the Timeline. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">I'm going to bring the DevTools down to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">bottom. You can actually just drag it down. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1042">All right. I'm going to start a Timeline recording </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1042">with command "E," and just scroll through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1049">the page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1049">All right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1054">Now, what's really cool about what the Timeline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1054">tells us is it basically tells us the narrative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1060">of performance of this site. As I scrolled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1060">through, a few things happened. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1066">Up at the top, it was pretty quiet and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">was just the headline, and then here we got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">into this green section. What this was is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">a lot of draw calls. Time is spent inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">draw and painting, and this is when all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">these orange circles are coming up and populating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">this screen. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">Then we get into a lot of yellow, and what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">this is is JavaScript execution, of course. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1085">And this is coming in because of all the computation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1090">required to make this functionality happen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1090">Then things are kind of pretty chill as we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">go through this middle area. We got &mdash; we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">mostly hitting our target of 60fps, so we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">staying within our frame budgets, no big problems. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1101">And then down towards the end where we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">this kind of effect, we're getting kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">a cacophony of color. Lots of different things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">happening at once. Looks like a good amount </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">of re-calc style, layout, paint, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">also JavaScript all happening at the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">time. But overall we get this really great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">view of what the situations are, and first, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">I want to call out that this is not really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">a DevTools talk here at Chrome I/O. There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">a lot of other talks and some of them have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">already happened, but if you want to dive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">into how to figure out, you know, when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1134">have a lot of green, you're going to want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1134">to check out these talks from the jankfree </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1138">talk and the device agnostic development talk. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1138">Yellow, as luck would have it, is Follow the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1145">Yellow Brick Road to JavaScript performance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1145">That just worked out really well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1149">The G &mdash; if you're look at GCs and memory, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">there was a great talk earlier about Gmail's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">memory and performance and how the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">DevTools help there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1158">Compositing there's actually great stuff, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">and also layout, excellent stuff. So dig into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1163">those talks as well so you can find out how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1163">to use these tools in more detail. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1167">But I want to show a brand-new feature and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">let me show how it works. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1173">All right. So we're looking at this little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1173">section here where we have the &mdash; the &mdash; all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">the little balls that are kind of about to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">move around once I start scrolling. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1186">And I'm going to record a JavaScript profile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">because, as we saw, a lot of yellow in that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1190">section, and we want to know what's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1190">on. Let's just try it. I will hit command </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">D once this gets going. Come on. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">There we go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1205">Nice. All right. Command D to start and stop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">really fast. And so what you get, yeah, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">JavaScript profile. And so what we're seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">here in aggregate where my costs were spent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1219">And this is good. But in some cases, it doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1219">tell the whole story. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1224">You're interested in a picture that kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">tells the story over time and you are just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">seeing it at aggregate level. But here we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">can turn on the flame chart down at the bottom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">and we get to see a different look. This is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">over time where my time was spent inside V8. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1238">And in zoomout view, you get a sense of: Am </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1238">I doing the same sort of operations over time? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1244">But I can also dive in a little bit closer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1244">and understand what's going on. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1249"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Wow. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1252"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: So I want to point out a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1252">bit on how to read this. Callstack is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1260">Y axis. So height doesn't matter too much. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1260">What you are looking for is wide bars that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1265">are taking up time. In this case, it looks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1265">like &mdash; let's see, this little flame over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">here, we have a little bit of a pub sub. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">is not too heavy. But it looks like most of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1278">our ticks are inside of d3, inside of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1278">quadtreeview call and then a lot of insertchilds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1285">construct right here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1285">We are able to get a good visual view of where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1290">our costs are, and then we can dive in and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1290">make some optimizations later. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1294">All right. We also have a new experiment for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1294">profiling Canvas, and I want to show you how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">this works. So this is just a WebGL experiment, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">and we are going to open up the profiling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">panel. And we are going to select "capture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">canvas frame." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1309">Now, it just captured one frame of the canvas. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1309">And it is going to dig into all the draw calls. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1318">Here we'll listen to every single draw call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1318">that's happened to that canvas and we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1322">just go down, down, down, apply them one by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1322">one, and see how they affect and how this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1326">frame is built up over time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1326">And then we can open up one of those draw </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1331">calls and see all the functions that contributed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1331">to that specific draw. And if we want, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">can click over to the sources panel to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">the source of each of those functions. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1341">Now, this is just a platform. We have great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1341">recording to be able to instrument record </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1347">and replay canvas. This is both 2D Canvas </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1347">and WebGL. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1351">Now, what really happens next is up to you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1351">There is &mdash; we could add a lot of features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">to this but we are interested in your feedback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">to hear what would be most useful to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">this great and improve the performance of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">your apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1362">All right. So five more key performance features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1362">I don't have too much time, but I want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">show them off pretty quick. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">All right. Continuous repainting mode. Fantastic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">if you are seeing a lot of green in your timeline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">view. You have a lot of paint costs and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">want to find out why. Turn on continuous repaint </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">mode. This is going to tell the browser to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1382">paint, paint, paint. And then you are able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1382">to turn off DOM, turn off different styles, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1386">see what is affecting your paints the most. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1386">In some cases, it is a little hard to see. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1391">Maybe box shadow and border reduce are on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1391">Maybe they are not too additive. It is a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1395">tricky. This will give you a lot of insight. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1395">The fps meter has been in there for a while, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1399">but it has been getting a lot of upgrades. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1399">You are able to see how fast you are throwing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1404">frames to the graphics context. You will get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1404">a histogram view over here, a min and max. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1408">And the GPU memory. This is really important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">on mobile where you only have a set amount </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">of GPU memory. If you are constantly evicting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">things out of the GPU memory, it might be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1417">slowing down how fast the user is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1417">seeing things. And this going to give you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1421">a lot of insight. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1421">Show paint, rects and layer borders, these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1424">are settings inside the DevTools. Great for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1424">understanding if you are getting a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">paints, what is the size and shape of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">paints. Maybe it is the entire screen is repainted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1434">&mdash; repainting every time you scroll. We want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1434">to understand that and find out why. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1439">In this screen shot, we can see that our a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1439">little dataset div just got repainted, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">we got a composite layer border around this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">side. This is actually the scroll bar, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">the browser is now compositing on top of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">page content. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1455">Object allocation tracking is brand-new. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1455">is basically taking continuous heap snapshots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1461">over time. And you are able to identify where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1461">objects are being created and identify the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1466">retain path. Great if you are digging into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1466">the memory performance of your app. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1472">Layout thrashing is a big problem with DOM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1472">&mdash; with the Web application's DOM performance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1477">So a lot of times, you will be touching the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1477">DOM. It will cause layout thrashing or reflows. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1483">And here we're able to not only see a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">things. So in timeline, you are going to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1488">a little icon if DevTools detects this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1488">a forced synchronous layout. It is going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1494">tell you it might be a possible performance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1494">bottleneck. You are doing more layouts than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1497">you have to. The user is not even seeing the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1497">work you're forcing. Then it will tell you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1502">the call stacks, why exactly the layout was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1502">forced, and why it was invalidated. You can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1507">dig into the sources right there and see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1507">actual call that forced it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1511">Now this is brand-new stuff. Identify what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">nodes need layout, how many there are, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">the total tree size that's getting reflowed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">is, and where the document root is. Sometimes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1523">&mdash; sometimes the entire document is being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1523">laid out again. Other times it is just a partial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">layout. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">All right. So a lot of stuff here. And you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1534">can try it out today. We have just been working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1534">&mdash; put in a lot of work on the DevTools documentation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1540">So not even &mdash; there is a lot more I didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1540">even show, and we have great docs to back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1545">it up. I encourage you to check those out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1545">And everything I showed today, all these features, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1549">are available in Chrome Canary now. So you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1549">can go, check them out, give them a shot, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1554">give us your feedback. Thank you guys very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1554">much. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1564">[ Applause ] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">And we have some time for questions. So I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1568">going to invite Pavel up on stage with me. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1568">And if you have any questions, I encourage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1575">you to line up at the mics. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1575">Sir? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1579"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hello. I was just wondering how much of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">this is available if you use GWIT to develop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1583">the Web site? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1583"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: GWIT? GWIT? Audience member: Google Web toolkit. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1588"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: It depends on whether you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1588">are using Sourcemaps for GWIT. If you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1592">using Sourcemaps, you have got all the debugging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1592">capabilities. Sourcemaps and Workspace are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1598">working well together. So you get pretty much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1598">all of it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1602"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So it is integrated as the Sass you showed? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1602"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Yeah. So you will need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1607">take care of generating JavaScript off your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1607">Java. And you might need to add a bit of extra </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1614">to reload it so that it was reloaded automatically. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1614">But you can edit Java. You can save it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">disk. Sourcemaps will be catching up. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">can debug using Workspace and Sass in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1626">time. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1626"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Cool, thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1627"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi, I'm (saying name) from LinkedIn Mobile. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">So Chrome DevTools are amazing. They're awesome. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">But what would be even more awesome, right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">is if we could use all these, the heap profile, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1638">the performance profile in Node. And there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1638">is a few projects, Node Inspector, Webkit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">Agent, Node Agent, that have been doing a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">pretty good job but the problem is that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">can't keep up with the development speed of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">the Chrome DevTool team and the V8 team. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">I'm curious if there are any plans to support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">no debugging memory management in Node? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1655"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: So node &mdash; I know Node Agent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1655">&mdash; Node Inspector, of course, is not as maintained </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1662">as it was before. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1662"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: It's dead. Officially dead. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1664"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Node Agent is picking up where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">it left off. Great profiling capabilities. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">In fact, I was just talking to the author </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">of it, like, three days ago about getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">flame chart support inside there. Be trivial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">for him to add. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">Those are all done over the V8 protocol. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">it's not too hard to bring in the front end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">which is completely open source, just the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">Web app, and hook up to the V8 protocol and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">bring in those features. So &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1690"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: At the same time, it's hard, right, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1693">there is no support for breakpoints. There </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1693">is no support for stepping through code into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1697">Webkit Agent. So I'm just curious if is any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1697">desire for the Chrome team to actually enable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1703">remote V8 debugging. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1703"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: So we are not using the old </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">V8 protocol for debugging in Chrome DevTools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">at the moment. We are based on the Webkit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1716">or now Chrome remote debugging protocol. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1716">it requires some native code supported in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1724">Node and exposing particular features including </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1724">support of the transport over the WebSockets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1730">for the whole story to work. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1730">So it is just an effort. We are happy to assist </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1735">there or work with Node on making it greater, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1735">better, and faster. But it just requires some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">work. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1743"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Excellent. Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1746"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi. I heard there were some experiments </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1746">at integrating Code Mirror and ACE into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">syntax highlighting. Is there any ETA where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">you are headed with any of that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1758"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Sure. Code Mirror, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1758">enable it today in settings and you will be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1762">using it is as your default editor. We are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1762">still figuring out the editor story. We are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">unhappy with anything we see because we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">to &mdash; we are kind of a unique situation where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">you need to be able to debug obfuscated Gmail </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">where lines are tens of thousands of characters. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">At the same time, you want to wrap it, native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">feedback and feel for the editing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1786">So we are still unhappy with everything we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1786">have. We are working on the hybrid approach </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1790">that would address all of these and make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1790">the best editor. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1793"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Cool. Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1793"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi there. Great stuff. The Chrome extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1801">that you showed off, I don't see it on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1801">DevTools site. Is it out or is it? Is it just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1807">in your Github repo? Where is that? The Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1807">thing that kicks ass. Like, how do we download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">it? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1815"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: It is in my github repo. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1818"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: This is how I always get to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1818">it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1822"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: A little disclaimer. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">way it works, it bundles ADB. It bundles ADB </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">and it works only for Mac only at this moment. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">It may be easy to make it work on Linux, not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1836">as easy to make it work on Windows because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1836">of the USB drivers. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1840">We are working hard to resolve that and make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1840">it useful everywhere and convenient to everybody. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">But it's currently in the preview mode. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">why you don't see it on our Web page. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1849"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1849"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">editor features you have shown will make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1857">much more convenient to use a device like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1857">a Chromebook Pixel to do real Web development. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">I'm wondering if the Workspace features that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">you showed have filesystem access? So if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1868">have user local mydev files running on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1868">machine, will you be able to edit those from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1873">the Chrome DevTools on the Chromebook? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1873"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Under the hood, it is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1878">filesystem API that's mapping things directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1878">to your filesystem. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">On any device that has filesystem, Workspace </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">will work, including Chrome OS where you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">map it to your downloads folder or your drive. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">We are generally unhappy with the &mdash; our development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">story on Chrome as yet, and we are working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">on it because important things such as version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">control integration are missing. So we want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">a complete, full-fledged story there. We are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1905">just not there yet. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1905"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1909"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hello. So two &mdash; first one quick question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">So you were trying when you edited a file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">in your editor in Sublime, it will it load </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">automatically in DevTools and I guess not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1919">just in the DevTools but, like, in the pages, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1919">right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1923">The question is &mdash; second question is more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1923">about how far are you &mdash; do you think you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1928">will take DevTools in terms of editing? Like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1928">for example, I work on backbone applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1934">where it would be great if I could jump to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1934">definition of the method from one class to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1939">its superclass and kind of things. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1939"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Okay. ID future center refactorings, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1946">we are editing because you want it. And we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1946">started with the debugging. We considered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1951">ourselves as a debugging instrumenting platform. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1951">But we can see that there is so much failure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1956">that can be added through by adding basic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1956">editing capabilities that we are on this route </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1960">now. And the time will show how far we would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1960">like to go there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">But things like code completion are definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">in our plans. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1968"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: One of the other things &mdash; Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">DevTools actually uses &mdash; you have heard of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1973">the uglify minifier. When it was working on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1973">the 2.0 with Sourcemaps support, we helped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1979">their crown funding contribution for that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1979">Similarly, we used Code Mirror. Code Mirror </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">is available, and the author behind Code Mirror </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">has been working on a new kind of insight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">for static analysis of JavaScript called TURN. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">And we contributed also to that, and we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">watching that project very closely. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">Sir, in the back? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2006"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: The things that you showed us with OS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2006">are awesome. Do you have any plans to support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2014">other frameworks such as layers or stylus? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2014"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: So I should have pointed out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2019">that what I showed was abstracted style support. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2019">It's all based &mdash; as I mentioned, it is all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">based off of Sourcemaps. And so nothing in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">our implementation is specific to Sass. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">is just to specific to Sourcemap support. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">So if Sourcemaps are supported inside the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2038">compiler for either layers or stylus, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2038">DevTools will start working with them today. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2044"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2044"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: All right. Thanks, everyone. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2046">Appreciate it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2046">[ Applause ] </span></p>
