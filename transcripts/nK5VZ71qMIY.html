<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/nK5VZ71qMIY">youtu.be/nK5VZ71qMIY</a><div id="transcript"><p><span class="line" data-startTime="0">  </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">Chrome Project Management Director Brian Rakowski. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="12"> RAKOWSKI: Hello, everybody. It’s so nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">to see everybody here to hear about extensions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="22">It looks a little bit crowded back there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="22">There’s lots of room up here. Don’t be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">shy. There’s room in the front if you need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">a little bit more space. We have a lot to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">talk about here. We’re going to talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">extensions and what we released yesterday. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="36">But before we do that, I want to take a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">of minutes to talk about the browser in Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">and what it means to us at Google. So we set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">out to build a browser because browsers are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">so important to us. We think that a browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">is the most important piece of software on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">your computer. We spend all day in front of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">browsers everyday. I’m sure a lot of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">do, too. All of our users come to us to through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">the browser, and we wanted to make sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">there was a really rock-solid set of fundamentals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">that supported the browser and gave us a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">platform to build on, and also a great user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">experience. So, with that in mind, we set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">out to make a browser that was fundamentally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">faster, safer, and more stable than what we’ve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">seen before. So, with that in mind, we’ve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">put a lot of effort in to some of our core </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">technology. V8 helps us with speed. Our multi-process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">architecture helps us with stability. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">our sandboxing technology helps us with security. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="87">All these things are very, very important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">to us. They also help us with extensions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="91">And you’ll hear more about that as we get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">a little bit further into the presentation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="94">So far, the response to Chrome has been amazing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="102">We’ve been overwhelmed by how positively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">people have responded. We’ve got over 40 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">million regular users of Chrome. We’re blown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">away by the response there. We have continued </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">to improve on our core fundamentals of speed, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">security, stability. You can see here that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">our performance on JavaScript execution has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">improved by 150% since we first launched the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">browser; something we’re very proud of. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="123">We’ve also worked on DOM manipulations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="127">For pages that try to manipulate the DOM through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">JavaScript, we’ve made huge strides in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">last release; so we’re very proud of that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">as well. We’re also rounding out the feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">set. There’s a bunch of features that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">consider to be basic features that a browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">needs. And we’ve been rounding those out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">for the last four releases of the browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="145">We’ve also added a little bit some more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">frivolous features, I guess; something a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">bit more fun in themes. In case you have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">urge to put Mariah Carey's face on your browser, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">you can now do that. People seem to really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">like that feature. So, we’ve made a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">of progress in the last year. We’re really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">proud of what we’ve done. A big gap for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">the last year has been our lack of support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">for Mac and Linux. We can finally cross that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">off the list. And, of course, the other big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">gap is extensions. And that’s what we’re </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">here to talk today. We’ve also made a huge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">investment in the platform. We want the platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">to be more powerful in terms of what users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">can see and what developers can deliver to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">users on the platform. So we’ve made a huge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">investment in HTML5. We're delivering lots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">of capabilities there. We’ve also made a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">big investment in developer tools, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">team is to deliver some cool enhancements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">to developer tools. And you’ll see some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">of that in the talk that Aaron and Erik are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">going to deliver. But we’re going to spend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">all of our &mdash; the rest of the time talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">extensions. And extensions are incredibly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">important to us. When we built Chrome, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">wanted to focus on creating a very simple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">user experience that evoke the Google aesthetic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">of being very powerful but didn’t have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">lot of features that got in your way. It wasn’t </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">intimidating in any way. And that was our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">core &mdash; one of our core principles of simplicity, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">or as we like to say, content not Chrome. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="226">But when we started to work on extensions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">we wanted to adhere to that same aesthetics. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="231">So you’ll see throughout the talk some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">the work we’ve done to make sure that that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">stayed as simple as possible. Now, one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">the things we learned as we started to hear </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">our users’ feedback after the first year </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">of Chrome was that every user has the handful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">of extensions or handful of features that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">they cannot live without. But those same features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">to 90% of users are called bloat. So, our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">answer to that is extensions. And this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">an area we’re very serious. We’re going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">to put a lot of effort into making extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">more and more powerful over time. But the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">start we have is phenomenal. And without anymore </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">background, I’m going to hand it over to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">Erik and Aaron to talk about what we set out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">to build, how we built it, and how it all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">works. So, here, we have Aaron Boodman and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">Erik Kay to talk about the rest of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="276">[END] </span></p></div>
