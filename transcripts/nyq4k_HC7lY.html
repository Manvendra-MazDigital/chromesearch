<p><span class="line" data-startTime="54">She just knows how to lead, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">she knows how to see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">future, and she's an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">extraordinary leader of Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">and of our industry, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">and I welcome Susan </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">Wojcicki to the stage. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="70"><span class="speakerName">Susan Wojcicki</span>: So good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">evening, everyone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="71">It's really great to see such </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">a wonderful turnout </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">for our talk here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="77">And since this is a developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">conference, I thought I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">talk about a few key principles </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">that we use when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">we're developing Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">products. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="85">And I've been involved for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">a long time in a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">products, so I summarized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">this down to two. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="92">But before I do that, I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">to talk a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">about my personal story. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="96">And since Megan talked about me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">being a landlord, I thought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">I would start there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="100">So when people ask the question, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">well how did you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">decide to join Google? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">I sometimes have to say, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">my story's kind of unusual, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">it's not really like everybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">else's story. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="112">Google actually &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">I actually lived with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">the company, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">Google, for five months. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="117">And I don't think really anyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">else can say that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">except for my husband. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="125">And so what happened was I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">renting rooms in my house, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">so, again, Larry had just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">gotten funded for their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">company and they were looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">for space, and I was looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">for renters, and we agreed on an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">amount, and they moved in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="143">And at first I didn't really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">think that much about it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">other than they were renters. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="148">But then people would read about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">it, and then they would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">ask me questions. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="153">And I would say, oh yeah, I know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">them, they're actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">renting in my garage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="159">And so I started using the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">products, and you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">remember there were a lot of big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">competitors out there that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">were much, much bigger than this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">little company of three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">people, at the time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="173">So I started using the product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">and it was pretty good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="177">And I had this realization at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">one moment, because the site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">actually went down. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="182">The servers were still running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">at Stanford, and it was at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">that moment that I couldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">reach Google, and that's when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">I really realized how important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">it had become to me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">in my life, and I realized the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">potential for the world, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">that's when I decided I really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">wanted to join Google and be a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">part of that future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="203">So that's my story, in terms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">of why I joined Google. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="206">So I joined, and I was there for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">one day, and Sergey comes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">up to me and says, I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">a mission for us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="216">It's to organize the world's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">information to make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">universally accessible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">and useful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="221">What do you think? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">I said, well, I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">in [INAUDIBLE]. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="228">So there are less than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">20 of us here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="232">And you guys all just graduated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">from college. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="234">So that's a pretty ambitious </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">goal, right there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="238">But that brings me to my first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">point which is that do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">something important, think big, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">and have a big goal of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">how you can change the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="247">And I was really pleased to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">that Larry talked about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">that this morning in his </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">keynote, where he said that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">there's so many things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">haven't been done yet, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">important to focus on the great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">things that haven't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">happened yet. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="260">And that's really a focus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">that we have in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">our development process. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="263">And a lot of times, doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">big, ambitious things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">sounds really hard. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="268">In fact, they sound crazy, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">they sound impossible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="272">But when you break them down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">into parts, a lot of times you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">can realize they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">actually doable. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="277">And doing really hard, crazy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">things also has the advantage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">that it's a lot less </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">competitive, because there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">fewer people who want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">to do crazy things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="285">Like you. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="286">So let me give a few stories. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="288">So let me start with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">Street View. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="291">So we have the beautiful imagery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">that comes from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">Bright Angel Trail in the Grand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">Canyon that we have been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">working on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="300">In fact, here in the lobby you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">can actually see the camera </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">that has created it, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">can actually try on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">backpack, and walk around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">and see how we did it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="309">But when I first heard about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">Street View, it was just the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">idea, which is let's create a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">way to take pictures of all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">the streets in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">whole world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="321">Right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">And I went, OK. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="324">And then, you think about it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">and these ideas sound crazy at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">first, but then you start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">thinking, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">would you do that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">And you start thinking, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">you would have cars, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">would have cameras, or you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">have people, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">would have cameras, and then you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">start talking, well, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">kind of cameras? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">And then you find people who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">actually really want to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">that, and then you're on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">way to making it happen. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="345">So we just launched our 50th </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">country with Street View, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">five million miles of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">Street View imagery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="352">So from a very simple idea, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">have something that enables </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">people to see imagery from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">all over the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="359">Which is amazing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="365">So going on to the next big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">idea, which we are still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">working on, which are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">driverless cars. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="371">Now, if you think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">driverless cars, and you hear </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">about this idea, it also sounds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">like this giant idea, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">is it really going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">to get done? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">Are we actually going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">be able to do this? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">And if so, when? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">And so, there are many, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">many benefits. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="386">It's probably the most dangerous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="386">thing we all do, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">yet we have to do it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">which is drive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="391">And you think about the benefits </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">of saving lives, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">emissions, and it really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">could make a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">difference in the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="399">So my goal is to have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">people at Google do this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">before my kids start driving. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="405">So I have a personal OKR here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="408">But it's just an example of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">really big idea that doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">sound possible that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">can make have happen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="413">So let me move on to the second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">big principle that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">think about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="418">Now, when I'm working with teams </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">and they are telling me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">they're going to create some new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">product, or they have some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">idea, and they want to staff it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">and they want to build it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">I ask them, what is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">your insight? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">Tell me something why you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">doing something new, why </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">you've observed something in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">the world that's different, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">and what's your insight that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">going to make this product be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">a big success? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">And I found that if they can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">answer that, the product's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">usually a success. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="447">And if they can't, then it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">often time to go back to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">drawing board. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="451">And I think about the insights </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">as because there's so much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">technology, and the world that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">we live in is changing so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">much, if we go around and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">look really, really carefully </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">at how the world's changing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">and we see new technology, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">sometimes we can see glimpses </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">of how the world will change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">in the future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="468">And if we can see that glimpse, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">then we can build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">around it, and we can plan for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">it, and we can build those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">next generation solutions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">we can build that future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="479">So I'm going to give a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">examples, actually, of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">insights that have been really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">important to me and my product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">development, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">have guided me. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="488">And again, a lot of times these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">are just one sentence, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">but they're powerful because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">it's a nugget that you can use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">to build your products. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="495">So I was working on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">Google Video &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">and as you can see, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">the YouTube logo here &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">and when I was working on Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">Video, we were working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">with studios who had great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">content, and we were working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">to bring this online. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="513">But at the same time, after we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">had just gotten it online, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">users are starting to be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">to see it, we had this other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">video that became very, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">very popular. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="522">In fact, it became &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">the numbers were significantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">larger than what we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">seeing from the studio in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">studio deal we had done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="530">And it made me realize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">the power of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">user-generated content. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="534">So do you guys want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">to see that video? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">Yes? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">All right, let me show you a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">few, just 15 seconds of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="541">But it was this video that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">really gave me that insight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="543">and that inspiration. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="553">What I love about that video is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">that the roommate is doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">his homework in the background </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">the entire </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">time, and doesn't notice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="559">But this was an insight. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="560">I realized, wow, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">user-generated content, it can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">be really, really powerful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="564">And today we all know that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="564">because that's what the world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">has become, user-generated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">content. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="569">It has its place, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">very valuable. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="571">There's also all kinds of other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">content that's produced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">professionally that's really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">really important to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="575">ecosystem, too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="576">But it was that video that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">really gave me the confidence </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">in thinking that we should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">acquire YouTube. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="584">And I was a big advocate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">of it, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">Google spent $1.65 billion. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="587">So sometimes you have one little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">insight, and from that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">little insight, you make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">a really big decision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="594">So I want to talk about another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">insight that's near </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">and dear to my heart, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">which is ads. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="600">I'm responsible for Google's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">ads business. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="603">Now, we created an ad system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="603">when Google had not very many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="609">people at the company &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">I would say probably like 30 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">people at the company. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="614">And we didn't really have enough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">people even to build a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="617">search engine, let alone to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="617">try to build an ad system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">where nobody knew anything about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">advertising, nothing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="624">None of us had ever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">worked in it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="626">But we had an insight, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">insight is something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">I still use today when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">I think about the ad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="631">products that we build. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="633">And the insight's very basic, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">but it's ads are information. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="637">Now, if you think about ads </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">being information, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">think about them just being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">commercial information, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">the ads need to be relevant, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">the ads need to be useful, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">the ads need to be shown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">to the right person </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">at the right time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="650">Just like we think about that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="650">first search result. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="652">And so that meant we had to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">build our own ad system. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="655">That meant that if you typed in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">flowers, you had to see ads </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">about flowers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="659">That if you typed in the name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">of any book, all the ads had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">to be about the book. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="664">Not just for a bookstore, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">for that actual book. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="667">And so that's a principle that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="667">we use that caused us to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">an ad system. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="672">And if I think about things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="672">today, sometimes I'll get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">questions, like when we first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">went into display, people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">would ask me how do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">feel about image ads? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">How do you feel about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">video ads? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">Do you think an image ad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">could not be a good ad? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">You think about that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="686">Well, an image is information. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="688">Are images useful to you? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">Yes, then an image ad can be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">useful provided it's served at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">the right ad, at the right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">time, to the right user. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="695">All of it, at the end of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">day, is about serving right ad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">and making it useful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="700">So that's an insight that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">we've used across our ad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">business, from beginning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">till present. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="707">And just going forward, moving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">really quickly to the present, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">if you look at today, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">say, well, what do you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">about today? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">What are things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">you're focused on? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">I would say, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">to be thinking a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="716">lot more about location. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="717">We have all these phones, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">phones know where we are, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">do we make all the services </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">that we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">super relevant to us? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">So you think about all of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">having traveled, probably come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="728">from all different places, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="728">staying in hotels, and looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">for places to eat. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="734">Now, how many of you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">actually gotten some kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="737">offer related to where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="737">are right now that would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">be useful to you? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">I'm looking, but I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">see a few people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="747">They are the brave souls who &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">or the people who have special </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">technology, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">have special insights. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="752">But it's something that doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">really happen yet, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">there's no reason it shouldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">and couldn't. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="756">We should all be getting useful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">information based on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">where we are right now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="760">And the reason we haven't, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">just because those systems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">haven't been built out yet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="764">This so it's just an example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">of an insight in the way we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">should think about things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">in the future. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="768">So just to sum up, those are my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">two insights, that's how we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">think about building. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="772">We think about doing things are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">really important, things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="774">that haven't been done yet, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="774">things that will be used by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">billions of people, and to think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">about insights, and what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">the future will look like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="782">Get an insight into that future, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">and then build for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">that future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="785">And by building for it, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">will become the future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="788">So I'm very excited about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="788">future of technology and how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">it's changing our world. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="792">I think there are so many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="792">opportunities for us and for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">all of you, and I'm looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">forward to that future. </span></p>
