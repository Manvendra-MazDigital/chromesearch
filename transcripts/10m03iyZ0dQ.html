<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2"><span class="speakerName">Tom Broxton</span>: Hello. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">Good morning. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3">Good afternoon, rather. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="5">This is Josh Sassoon. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="7"><span class="speakerName">Josh Sassoon</span>: This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">is Tom Broxton. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="9"><span class="speakerName">Tom Broxton</span>: And we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">designers on the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">experience team at YouTube, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">we wanted to talk to you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">today a bit about how we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">design products in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">multi-screen world. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">We wanted to give you a bit of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">kind of a factory tour and a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="24">peek behind the curtain of some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="24">of the ways that we do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">things at YouTube and some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">the reasons behind some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">changes that you'll be seeing on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">YouTube in the future, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">then what some of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">might look like. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">We'd give you a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">sneak peek of that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">So with that, I'll hand you over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">to Josh, and he can begin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">by telling you a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">bit about YouTube. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="43"><span class="speakerName">Josh Sassoon</span>: So just to take a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">big picture view of YouTube, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">YouTube is actually a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">really, really tough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">problem to design for. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="52">And when you think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">YouTube, it's probably just, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">up to a lot of people, a place </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">where you go for cat videos. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="58">But when you think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">YouTube as a corpus of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">content, it's a huge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">unstructured, massive corpus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">with a huge breadth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">of content &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">everything from cat videos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">to revolutions &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">and it really doesn't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">a consistent structure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="71">YouTube is kind of this "Choose </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">Your Own Adventure" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="74">And it's important to or step </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">back from YouTube and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">understand what YouTube </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">is and what it isn't. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="80">And YouTube really isn't like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">any other service out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="84">Nothing like it exists. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="85">YouTube is essentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">the container for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">entire world of video. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="90">Everything is on YouTube. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="92">Everything on YouTube is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">uploaded, and it can be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">virtually anything. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="98">And on top of that, our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">audience is everyone &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">everyone across the world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">and every demographic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="104">Everyone watches YouTube. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="106">And what's great about YouTube </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">is it's unique in its ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">to provide for this incredible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">universal experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="112">And it can also be an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">incredibly personal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="114">It's both of those things, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">we have to really find a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">balance between that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="118">We have to find a way to show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">everyone in the world "Gangnam </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">Style." And on the more personal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">level, I personally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">am learning how to play the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">violin off of a series of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">YouTube videos from a creator </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">in a completely different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">state, and it's very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">personal to me. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="131">And that's a very different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">experience than the universal. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="135">So the beauty of YouTube is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">that there is this shared </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">experience that's universal, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">it's very collaborative. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="142">I think most everyone's heard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">of the "Harlem Shake" meme </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">that came up recently, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">not only did it start on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">YouTube, but it was actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">because of YouTube that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">everyone was able to collaborate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">and create these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">videos and parody and mimic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">each others' videos and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">actually create something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">wasn't there because of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">YouTube as a platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="159">And then on the more personal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">level, there's this really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">intimate, social aspect to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">YouTube, where people have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">YouTube parties. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="164">They crowd around a phone or a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="164">laptop, and everyone's dying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">to share a video with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">one another. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="169">So we have this incredible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">challenge of balancing, again, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">the universal and the personal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">and anything that can be a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">completely global phenomenon to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">something that's very much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">social and intimate that's just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">your group of friends. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="183">And the end experience of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">YouTube is incredibly hard to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">describe because of that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="188">So most people will say that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">YouTube is overwhelming, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">they can't really capture it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">or describe in any way. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="194">It doesn't have enough structure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">or anything that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">consistent enough about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">corpus of content to really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">capture in any way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="202">And there's this common feeling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">amongst our viewers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">that it's hard to decide what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">to watch next or how to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">discover something new or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">how to find something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">that they'll love. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="210">And on top of that, it's even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">harder for them to refind it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">or to collect it in a way where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">they know how to keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">track of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="217">And so the general sentiment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">is, I know that YouTube has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">everything on it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="221">I just don't know how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">to make sense of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="223">And that's what makes it such a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">tough problem to design for. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="228"><span class="speakerName">Tom Broxton</span>: And so as YouTube </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">keeps growing and our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">relationship with online video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">grows and changes, and what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">online video is grows and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">changes, we're really moving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">from being this web-based site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">to being a service running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">across a multiplicity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">of devices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="245">So we begin to think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">YouTube as a platform upon </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">which we can share content out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">the world, to people wherever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">they are and whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">they're looking at. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="256">So at the moment, we feel that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">we've got a series of apps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">each specialized on their own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">platform, that tries to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">the best aspect of that platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">and allow you to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">to the content in the way that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">that platform makes sense. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="274">But the problem with this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">that it gives the impression </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">to our viewers that something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">you found or bookmarked or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">saved in one place isn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">available in another place. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="283">And it doesn't give a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">sense of one service and one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">set of videos that you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">looking on across the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="292">So as we work on our next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">generation of product design, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">we're really thinking about how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">can we harmonize that so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">we can move away from this sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">of web first, and these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">other devices second, to a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">service that's at the center </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">of everything with thousands </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">of devices and thousands of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">products that are pointing into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">this, so you can connect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">to the content you want at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">right time in whatever way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">suits you best. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="320">And as designers, we really want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">to provide this in a way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">that's delightful and enjoyable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">to everyone, to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">that connection experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">exciting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="330">Because from cat videos to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">revolutions, people tell us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">about these amazing and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">inspiring experiences that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">they have on YouTube. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="336">And we really see our job as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">connecting those people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">together and making it really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">easy for those kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">connections and experiences </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">to happen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="348">So at Google, at YouTube, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">really believe that the way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">do this, the way to achieve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">great design that is relevant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">to people is to really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">understand the people, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">understand the user and their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">needs and what they're trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">to get out of things. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="363">So the problem with that is, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">Josh has already said, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">breadth of our audience is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">such that many of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">traditional methods that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">learned for understanding the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">audience that are coming to your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">site or to your service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">are quite ineffective. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="380">So one of the great tools we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">have to address this at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">YouTube, or one of the great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">assets we have to address this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">at YouTube, is a strong research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">team who can really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">come up with some innovative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">ways of addressing the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">needs, understanding user needs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">and finding ways to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">address them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="399">So they come up with some really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">innovative methods, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">especially for attacking this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">problem of how things change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">as we move to a more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">device-centric world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="407">They've come up with some really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">innovative ways to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">tackle this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="410">And I wanted to share some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">those with you, because I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">think they're really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">interesting, and then some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">the high-level insights that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">we're taking away from those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">and what we're learning about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">why people use our service the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">way they do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="426">So just to explain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">how this works. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="429">They've been running a series </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">of large-scale diary studies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">when they send out these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">booklets to volunteers, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">people record and share daily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">activities about how video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">consumption fits into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">their life. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="441">There's a variety of exercises </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">in the books &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">day-by-day diaries and these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">time wheels that I'll explain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">a little bit more in a moment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="449">And the overall effect was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">that they gave us some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">insights into what people are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">doing during the day. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="456">So this is the time wheel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">diagram I was just describing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">and the idea of this is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">people can record and give us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">insight into how their day </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">works, what devices they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">using to consume media and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">video during the day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="474">So here, the little markers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">show where they are, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">they're doing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="479">So you can see transport, on I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">at home, or I'm at work, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">and who they're with as well, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">we get an understanding of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">kind of social activity. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="488">And then the inside purple ring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">is phone activity, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">you can see the short </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">phone interactions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="495">And then we've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">a tablet wheel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="499">The laptop is the yellow, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">TV is the long sessions that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">you see on the outside. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="506">And then, we can take many, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">many, many of these diagrams, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">and we can use many clever and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">also not so clever methods of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">processing them and looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">patterns and try to get these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">patterns and understand the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">behaviors and motivations as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">to why people pick up a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">particular device and use it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">in a particular way and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">what they're trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">to get out of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="528">And then, we can check those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">against the actual traffic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">patterns that we see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">coming to our site. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="531">And we can see how these things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">match up, and there's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">lot of information you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">draw from that kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">comparison. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="538">So to begin to get to some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">the insights that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">drawing out of these &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">that's just one method. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="544">There are quite a lot of other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">pieces that we're using. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="548">So we try to draw all these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">together into some insights </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">that I could share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">with you today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="552">And the most basic starting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">ones are just some device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">principles that as designers we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">like to get down to a sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">of framework or a set of ideas </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">that we can all agree on so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="564">that when we talk about phone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="564">or tablet with each other as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">we develop products, we'll have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">a sort of basic, shared </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">understanding of how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">these things work. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="573">So I want to share that with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">you quickly to begin with, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="575">because it underpins a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="575">of what's following. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="579">So I'll just go through them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="579">quickly, device by device. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="583">The phone is sort of typified by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">this pattern you see in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">purple there of really morning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">til evening, like I wake up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">til I go to bed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="593">It's always with me, and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">these fast, frequent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">interactions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="597">You know how it is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="598">You're always checking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">your phone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="599">You're almost like a chicken </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">pecking at the corn. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="604">But what we do notice is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">a lot of this interaction is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="609">reactionary. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="610">So people are really getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">status notifications or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="617">updates, or people are telling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="617">them about something. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="619">So phone-based interactions are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">what we're thinking of as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">reactionary. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="625">And the other thing we really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">notice about the phone &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">and people talk about it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">in interviews &mdash; is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="629">how personal it is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="630">People are very unwilling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">to let their phone go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="632">So you've got a strong chance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">that the person on the end of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">that device is the person </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">you think it is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="638">The only exception really to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">this personality or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">personal nature of the phone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">is in child pacification, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">where we constantly see. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="646">And these are people who'll just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="646">hand over any device to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">get some peace. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="650">So that's the one person </span><span class="line" data-startTime="650">who might be on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">other end of the phone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="655">And another surprise for us was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">just that although people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">often use the term phone and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">mobile interchangeably, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">trying to stop doing that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">because there's less mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="667">usage on the phone then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="667">you'd expect. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="668">I was expecting a lot of it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="668">be kind of on the bus or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">traveling, and a lot of mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">usage is actually at home. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="673">More than half of the usage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">we're seeing is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">from within the home. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="678">So the tablet, to kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">contrast that, it seems to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">have a slightly surrogate role </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">in people's lives, and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="687">usage is slightly unclear. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="690">People often talk about using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">it instead of some other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="692">device, so instead of my phone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="692">or instead of my laptop or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">something like that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="696">The marked difference from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">phone is that usage seems to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">be planned much more. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="700">People talk about downloading a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">movie to watch later to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">on the bus, on the train, or I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">want to read a book in bed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="707">So it tends to be more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">ritualistic and less habitual. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="714">And so that's leading us to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">the conclusion that using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">scaled up phone UIs on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">the tablet is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">always the best idea. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="720">The reason people could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="720">be using it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="722">could be slightly different. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="724">And the surprising thing is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">people don't seem be using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="726">them &mdash; at least for video &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="726">people don't seem to be using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="728">them as much as they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="728">think they do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="729">If you ask them in an interview, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">they'll say, oh, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="731">always use my tablet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="732">I love my tablet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="734">And then when you look at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">patterns through the day, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="737">tablet usage is much lower than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="737">they suggest themselves. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="742">The PC, just quickly, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">is to perceived much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">more as a work device. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="746">Usage is much more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">in the daytime. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="748">This is especially true with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">the arrival of the tablet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="750">People, as I said, instead of, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">people are switching much more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">of their usage towards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">the tablet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="755">And the other interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">point we noticed &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">even though we think so much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">about living in a kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">post-desktop world, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">post-keyboard world, there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">still so many organizational </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">tasks that people can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">achieve through these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">other interfaces. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="769">People still talk about turning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">back to their laptop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">as a control panel and as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">a device to, in the end, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="774">organize things and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="774">complex tasks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="777">And finally, the TV is still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">sort of the epicenter of video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">consumption. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="784">Everything else seems to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">revolve around the TV. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="787">Sessions are longer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">less interactive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="790">You see these big orange bars. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="791">And they're pretty constant. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="793">Through all of the research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">that we're doing, we see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">people have it on in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">the background. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="799">It's often associated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">with multitasking. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="801">You'll see the phone or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">tablet, all these things being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="803">used at the same time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="805">And our important takeaway for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">the TV is really that it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="809">shared device or it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="809">a social device. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="813">People are very aware that there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">are many people looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">at the screen at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">the same time. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="818">So be careful about what you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="818">put up on the TV and are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">sharing, since through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">social data, people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">don't appreciate that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="828">There's a couple of interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">trends or sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">continuums that we notice that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">run across all the devices in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="834">the order that I showed them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="835">So as you go from a small screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">size to a large screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">size, session length </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">and the length of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">videos viewed increases. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="845">It's kind of intuitively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">sensible, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="846">You're more likely to watch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="846">a movie on the TV. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="851">But also, interactions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">go down. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="853">So people want to interact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">less with a screen that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="855">bigger and further away. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="856">And whereas phone is a habitual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">device &mdash; the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">we're describing is phone is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">habitual device, and the TV is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">a ritualistic device. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="864">People have times of day when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">they want to go to their TV, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">but as I said, they kind of pick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">up and use the phone all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">through the day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="870">And again, it seems to kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">spread according to the screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">size across all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">the devices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="876">And the personal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">issue as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="879">Phone is a very personal device, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">and TV is seen as a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="881">very social device, and tablet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="881">somewhere in the middle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="884">I'm sort of happy to share my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">tablet in the way that I'm not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">happy to share my phone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="890">So the second insight that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="890">really came out of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">research was thinking about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">time of day and how people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">use their devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">through the day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="900">And the main key takeaway </span><span class="line" data-startTime="900">underlying all of this was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">really just people are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">incredibly busy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="905">They've got these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">furious lives. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="908">They're picking up kids. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="909">They're working, doing all this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">stuff, and it's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="912">important to fit into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="912">their schedule. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="915">So when we listen to our users, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">we hear, especially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">with the phone, that I need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">to be in control. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="921">I want to decide when I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">come in and go out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="924">I don't want to be distracted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">too much. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="927">So we need to get out of their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">way at the right moment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="929">And ideally, they really want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="929">us to get us to where they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="933">want to be without them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="933">having to ask. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="934">Obviously, the less </span><span class="line" data-startTime="934">interaction they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">can get, the better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="939">So when we think about what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">they're doing went through the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">day, a pattern that emerges as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">successful is sort of punchy, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="950">short news content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="950">in the morning. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="952">People are quite ritualistic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">about checking in and finding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">out what's going on at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">beginning of the day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="958">And then easygoing, pushed at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="958">you entertaining content in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">the evening, when perhaps you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">want to switch off a bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">and you don't want to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">constantly making choices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="970">So that tracks by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">device as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="974">So the phone, you tend to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="974">these sort of short, frequent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="979">status-snacking behavior. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="983">And UIs that work well with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">that tend to be these more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">feed-like UIs, where I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">check in, find out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">what's going on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="990">I want a sense of what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="990">going on in the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="994">Whereas on TV, something more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">static and relaxing, less </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1000">about scrolling, more about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1000">what's the content that I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">to be watching next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">and you tell me. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1008">So a third aspect that helps us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1008">when we're trying to think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">about designing these different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">UIs is thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1016">about the level of control and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1016">trust that people need to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1022">over an interface. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1023">So there are two sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">of modalities of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">behavior that we see &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">the "I know what I want" versus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">the "Entertain me." We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">notice that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">call for really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">two separate UI paradigms. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1036">One end of this continuum we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1036">thinking of as like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">trust based and one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">control based. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1042">And if we think about a user's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1042">intent along this continuum, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1045">it helps us to design a feature, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1045">a and what to watch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1048">next after you've watched one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1048">video on TV is an interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1052">example of this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1054">On TV, we have the added </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1054">challenge that we've got these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">very limited control input </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">devices, the D-pad controls. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1062">And combine that with this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1062">idea that we're trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1065">optimize for these long, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1065">relaxing evening sessions, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">we really find that the last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">thing you want is to kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">bombard people with these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">horrific walls </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1074">of choices of videos. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">So it works quite well on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">PC or on the desktop, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1079">you give people lots of choices, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1079">and they can see what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1081">it is they're after. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1082">On the TV, you show somebody a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1082">wall of videos like this, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1084">they'll just turn it off. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1088">As somebody pointed out, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1088">sort of like asking a kid, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1090">what vegetables do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1090">want for dinner? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">And they'll just be like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">nothing, or chips. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1094">They'll jump back to what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">they're familiar with. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1096">Whereas you might be better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">off asking them something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1098">like, do you want broccoli </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1098">or carrots? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1100">And then you kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1100">more likely to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1102">get a useful reaction. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1104">And it's kind of the same with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1104">video consumption as well. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">We find if you give them a big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">bombardment of choice, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">tend to react badly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1112">You give them a small number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">of choices, then people are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">much more positive about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">taking one of them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1120">So what we try to say with these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">kind of interfaces is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">here's what we think you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">want to watch next. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1125">You might also like &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1128">So we still give some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1128">opportunity for serendipity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1130">and a little bit of control, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1130">like letting people go, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">we're really concentrating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">on trust. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1136">And we're experimenting with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1136">different ideas and different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1140">UIs, title cards that might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1140">allow more sort of insight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1145">into the set of videos that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1145">you're watching such that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">gain sort of extra trust at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">the beginning of the talk, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">that you can really have more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">faith that the videos that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">coming up are the kind of videos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">that you're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">want to be watching, rather than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">giving the people this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">feeling that I'm just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">lost in the sea of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1163">thousands of videos. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1164">That way, I can lean back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1164">and enjoy the content. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">The opposite end of the scale </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">to this might be when people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1173">really want control. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1174">And as I said before, an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">interface that's really great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">for this is the phone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1180">And so, we're really looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1180">at ways that we can combine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">these experiences. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1185">So you might already see, we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1185">already got a UI that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1190">allows you to connect the phone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1190">YouTube experience to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1193">your TV or to any other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1193">large screen and let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1199">you pair the two. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1201">So you can send a video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1201">from one to the other. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1203">And these are incredibly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1203">successful at achieving this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">kind of high control. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">How do I get to the video I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">want, and then how do I share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1210">it with people? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">And the reaction's incredible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1214">If they can find it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1214">people describe the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">experience as magical. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1217">Especially if you've ever tried </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">to input a text search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1221">through using a D-pad control, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1221">you'll just know that these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">kind of interfaces are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">light years apart. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1230">And the final piece that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">helping us coming out of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">and various other research is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">the emotional connection. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1241">So I mentioned earlier how some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">of the more traditional </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1244">frameworks for thinking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1244">who your users are and what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">they want out of your products </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">are not working or don't work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1251">so well when you're user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1251">base grows beyond </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">the hundreds of millions. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1256">So we're really having to find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1256">new ways of trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">empathize with people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1259">And again, the research team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">have come up with some pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1261">innovative thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1261">around this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1263">And so rather than thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">about the personas and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1266">type of people coming to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1266">YouTube, they're pushing us to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1269">think about people's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1269">motivations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1271">behind why they're coming. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1274">And they're putting together </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1274">a framework that presents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1277">content in such a way that it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1277">can fit to people's moods. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1280">And we see this as making it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1280">more likely for them to engage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1284">with the content in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1284">a positive way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1286">So an example I'm sort of giving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1286">here of a framework we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">might be trying to feel out is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">under "feeling," we think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1292">about people seeking a mood, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1292">following a story. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1295">I'll give some examples </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1295">of that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1297">And then "learning," I guess, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1297">is more obvious. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1298">We've got a lot of educational </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1298">content, but we also see a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1301">of how-to videos and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1301">reviews on YouTube. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1306">And that's very important, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">popular content. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1308">"Knowing." We were talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1308">people sort of being in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1311">the know and finding out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1311">what's new and popular. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1313">A lot of people come and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1313">want to see the latest videos. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1318">So how do we accommodate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1318">those? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1320">What's the right UI for somebody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1320">coming in in that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1322">kind of frame of mind? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1323">And then "connecting" is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1323">comments and discussions, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">also sharing with friends, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">how we take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1331">those experiences back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1332">And that hopefully connects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">people back to the top of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">circle, where you can connect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">with your friends and share a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">feeling with them, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">they can learn and share. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">And that kind of framework, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">helps us build our use cases </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1346">and think about what success is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1346">for a product and what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1349">should expect people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1349">to get out of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1351">An example of where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1351">you might apply it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1354">could be through language. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1355">So "make me laugh" could well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1355">be a phrase that is more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1362">likely to trigger a positive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1362">reaction to the kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1365">content people want to connect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1365">with than, say, "pets and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1367">animals," which is the more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1367">logical place you might want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1371">to go to look for cat videos. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1373">But people don't really come in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">looking for cat videos and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1375">then think, oh, I'll click on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1375">"pets and animals." But if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1378">say "make me laugh," they can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1378">kind of relate to that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1381">So with that, I'll hand it back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1381">to Josh, who's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">explain a little bit about how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">you can apply these kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">lessons to design. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1388"><span class="speakerName">Josh Sassoon</span>: So as Tom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1388">mentioned, we do a ton of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1391">qualitative research to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1391">address a lot of our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1393">challenges. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1394">And what we need to do in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1394">combination with that is use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1397">data and quantitative analysis </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1397">to really kind of finish the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1402">entire design process and make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1402">sure that we're thinking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1406">this in a well-rounded manner. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1408">So we think a lot about how can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">database design actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">help us with our design </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">decisions when we're trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">organize and present </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">videos to viewers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1415">And we use a lot of analysis to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">try and figure out how can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1418">we go from something that feels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1418">messy to something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1421">feels very intentional and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">something that feels organized. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1423">And within something that feels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">organized, how much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1426">hierarchy do we show? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">How much density or how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">much diversity of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1430">content do we show? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">And a lot of our analysis on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">the quantitative side can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1434">really help us with that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1990"><span class="speakerName">Tom Broxton</span>: Yeah, OK. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1992">I think a lot of our initial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">impulse is driven out of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1999">frustration we see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1999">with search. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2001">So if you look at our TV </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">experiences, you'll see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2006">dual-screen experience promoted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2006">a lot from there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">because that's where we see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">the biggest advantage for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">people when they're having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2012">frustration typing in controls. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2014">So that's one of the places </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2014">where we started. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2019">And then, the other part of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2019">where it came from was really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">thinking about, as I say, all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">of the products working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2029">together off a common service. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">So rather than trying to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">specific remote control apps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">as we'd seen other people do, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">were trying to think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2038">well, I really should be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2038">to search for my content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2042">anywhere and play it anywhere. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2043">So that was one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2043">underlying principles of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2047">UI we were trying to develop. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2048">And not develop new apps, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">think about, OK, we've already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2052">got a mobile phone app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2053">And we've already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2053">got a TV app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2054">What's the best way of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2054">connecting these two together, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2057">and how do I really want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2057">use these two things? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2061">There's a sort of famous use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2061">case for YouTube, right, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">we all know about where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">everybody's got a video that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2069">they want to show everybody. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2070">And so everybody's waiting to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">queue up and play their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">favorite video, so that was sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">of one of the underlying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">motivations was how do we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">make that really easy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2080">So if we can all find that video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2080">on our phone and play it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2083">on the TV, that's a great win. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2088">I'd say the difficulty is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2088">balancing all of the different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">use cases together that don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">always interact, the way that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">use case works next to, oh, I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">just got a playlist that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2097">I want to put up on the TV and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2097">leave running during a party. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2099">The two can be kind of in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2099">conflict with each other. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2113"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: So I wanted to ask, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2113">when you're designing for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">cross device, are you having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">any of those devices drive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">what the rest of the devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">are looking like? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2123">Are you starting from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2123">phone and bringing it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">tablet elsewhere? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">And then, do you feel like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">you're compromising on some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">these devices because you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">trying to maintain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">consistency? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">Like, is this truly the best </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">tablet experience, or is it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">the best that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">do with consistency? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2138"><span class="speakerName">Josh Sassoon</span>: I mean, I came </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2138">from designing for desktop for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">almost two years. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2142">And so it's really easy to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2142">fall into this pattern of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2144">every feature exists on desktop, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2144">so we're just going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">to try and wedge it into mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">or figure out how does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">that work on TV. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2151">And the reality is we just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">make really concerted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2155">decisions to constrain and say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2155">we just don't need to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2159">half of these things for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2159">certain devices. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2161">So we've really started to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2161">reapproach some of our new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2163">projects, from thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2163">about, how does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2166">this start with mobile? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">How does it start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">on the tablet? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2168">How does it start on the TV? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2169">And we're really starting to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2169">think about desktop as an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2172">equal instead of the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2172">thing we think about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2175">And so it's actually a pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2175">interesting time for us right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2178">now, because we're doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2178">all these explorations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2182">And granted, many of them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">do start with desktop. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2185">We're actually making sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2185">we put mobile or tablet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">on an equal playing field in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">those explorations and say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2191">what do you actually really need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2191">when you're staring at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">your phone? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2194">And 99% of the time, all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2194">things that we do on desktop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2197">don't translate exactly or even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2201">necessarily need to be there. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2202">So again, as Tom said, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2202">think about familiarity. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2206">We're not trying to just make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">it absolutely consistent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2208">We just want to make sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2208">when you're looking at your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2211">phone and your desktop, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2211">you feel like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">you're using YouTube. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2213">But the thing that you really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">need from the phone is very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2216">different from what you need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2216">on the desktop experience. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2220"><span class="speakerName">Tom Broxton</span>: I'd say just to add </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2220">to that that's definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2222">part of the motivation that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2222">was driving a lot of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">qualitative research that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">we talked about. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2226">Because I think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2226">so easy to have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2229">assumption of knowledge. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2231">We have so many learned patterns </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2231">from so many years of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">building a very large website </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">that we wanted to really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">immerse ourselves in the ways </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">of thinking of people using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2241">other devices. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2242">So that was part of the driver </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2242">behind that project. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2245"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: So if you were going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2245">to add a new capability into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2248">the YouTube service, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2248">would you start? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">Would you look across and say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">OK, I'm trying to design </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2254">simultaneously across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2254">all of them? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">Or do you have one where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">would start and then try to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2257">loop it back around? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2259"><span class="speakerName">Josh Sassoon</span>: Some of the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2259">features, we're thinking right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">away about how does it work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">across platforms. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2265">I mean, it's kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2265">overwhelming, because we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">trying to do it all. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">And we'll see how that works. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2272">But I think a lot of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2272">explorations now start with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2274">mobile, mobile and desktop. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2277">And then, TV is kind of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2277">next thing we think about. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2284"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: I just wanted to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">touch on some of the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2286">research that you guys has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2286">doing around kind of how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">people watch TV on a large, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">10-foot experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2295">Do you see the need to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2295">TV kind of be this like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2301">painkiller/zoning out use case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2301">dwindling with kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">co-viewing applications and all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">the research that shows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2311">that people are just spending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2311">increasingly large amount of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2314">time actually doing stuff while </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2314">they're watching TV, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">whether it's just being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">on Facebook on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2319">their phone or Twitter? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2320">It just feels like less of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2320">relaxing use case, and I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2324">just curious how that might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2324">change your perception of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2329">it's about in that 10-foot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2329">experience and how that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2331">changes the UI. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2332"><span class="speakerName">Tom Broxton</span>: I agree. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2332">And yeah, we're definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2332">seeing this same pattern. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2336">At the same time, the latest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2336">research we're doing just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2340">seems to suggest the TV's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2340">on more and in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2343">more passive role. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2345">The more it's used, at the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2345">time, the more we see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">two things going on together, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">the less interactive and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2352">more background role the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2352">TV seems to gain. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2358">Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2358">But then, I think that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2358">rise of these dual-screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2364">applications may change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2364">that a lot. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2367">I think they've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2367">a long way to go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2368">I was at CES earlier this year, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2368">and just everybody's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2373">throwing out these sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2373">of dual-screen apps. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2375">And I think there's going to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2375">a kind of madness of them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2377">for a while. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2378">And so how that affects what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2378">appearing on the main screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">while we all play with our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">iPods is interesting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2386">But I can't predict the pattern </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2386">yet of how that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2392">going to evolve. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2396">And I think we're running out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2396">time, so that might have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2399">be the last question. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2400">Thank you all very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2400">much for coming. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2402">[APPLAUSE] </span></p>
