<p><span class="line" data-startTime="0">Hello my name is Adam. In this video I ‘ll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">show you how to get your app uploaded in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="5">web store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="5">Until the store launches, developers will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">need to use the Chrome Extension gallery’s </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">upload flow and developer dashboard to upload </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">and manage their apps. So, to get your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">in the store, go to the Chrome extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="18">gallery at chrome.google.com/extensions and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="18">click on the “Publish your extensions” </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">link on the left. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="27">This will take you to our developer dashboard. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="32">Click “Add new item” to upload a new app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="32">You’ll then be asked to select the zip file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">that contains your app manifest. Select the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">file you have created, click "Upload" and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">you’ll be taken to a page where you will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">need to provide some additional information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">about your app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="50">For those of you who have developed extensions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">you will recognize a lot of the fields you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">need to complete, such as uploading screenshots, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">selecting the primary language for your app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">providing a detailed descriptions well as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">including links to your website and support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">materials. However, we have added a few more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">items on this page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="70">First of all you can select the price of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">app - by default this is set as free but you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">can change it if you want to. To do so, click </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">on the “Change pricing” button. This will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">bring up a panel that lets you select between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">3 pricing options: an option to keep your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">app free,  an option to use the Chrome Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">Store’s built in payment mechanism and finally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">the option to use a different payment system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">within your app. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="96">The first option is intended for applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">that never charge any money, apps that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">free from end-to-end. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="106">The second option, using the Chrome Web Store’s </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">payment mechanism, allows users to pay for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">your app directly within the Web Store. Using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">our licensing API you’ll then be able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">determine whether a given Chrome user who’s </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">entering your app has paid or not. If you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">select this option, you will be asked to define </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">the price for your app from a set number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">price points. If you’re setting up a subscription-based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">service, you can select whether to charge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">users per month or per year. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="131">In addition, you can specify whether users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">can try a free version of the app - we call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">this option “free trial”. With this option, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">users can instantly start using the free version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">of your app. We encourage you to integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">free trials because users are often more willing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">to spend money for an app after trying it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="151">The third option is intended for apps that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">use a custom payment solution. If you’ve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">integrated another payment provider, select </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">this option. Also select this option if the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">basic version of your app is free but users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">can pay for upgrades, virtual goods or other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">services later. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="170">In addition to the pricing options, you’ll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">also be asked to select up to 3 app categories </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">under which your app should be listed in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">store. To ensure good user ratings for your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">apps make sure to include your app only in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">relevant categories. This list will likely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">be updated before our launch, so feel free </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">to suggest additional categories for your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">app in the free form text box. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="189">Further down, is one more important section </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">for apps: We require that you verify the ownership </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">of the website that your app is hosted on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">using Google’s Webmaster Tools. You will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">see the list of verified websites that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">associated with your account in the dropdown. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="205">To verify additional websites, click the link </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">and follow the instructions for Google Webmaster </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">Tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="215">We have a lot more material on different elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">on the upload flow in our documentation located </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">at code.google.com/chrome/webstore. We are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">looking forward to seeing your apps in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">store! </span></p>
