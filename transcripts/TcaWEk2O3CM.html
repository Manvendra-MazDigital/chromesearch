<p><span class="line" data-startTime="0"> BIDELMAN: All right, so people are still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">sort of filtering in but we can get started. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="7">Thank you for coming. This is, What is a Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">App, and it's going to introduce you to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">Chrome Web Store and building an application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">for the Chrome Web Store, so hopefully, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">in the right place. Just a little bit about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">myself for those that haven't seen me present </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">today. I &mdash; my name is Eric Bidelman. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">my Twitter handle there @ebidel at the top. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="31">I'm a developer programs engineer at Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="31">I've worked on a bunch of different APIs and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">helped their developers with Google Docs and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">Sites and Base and OAuth. And now, I'm doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">things with Chrome and HTML5 and evangelizing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">the open Web and all the cool stuff you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">do with Chrome and modern browsers. So, today, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">we're going to talk a little bit about Chrome; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">what is it, where we &mdash; where were we, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">we're at now. And also in regards to HTML5, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">what's going on in HTML5 space in Chrome because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">ultimately, you know, we're building Web apps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">we're going to be building them using technologies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">like HTML5. And then we'll switch gears and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">sort of think and talk about what a Web app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">looks like. So thinking gets your mind thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">about the certain components of a Web app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">and how they look, how they feel. We'll talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">about the Chrome Web Store, how do you publish </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">an application, how do you write an app and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">write or install the Web application. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">kind of a new concept. There's two types; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">there's a host app and a package app. I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">discuss both compatibility and then we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">take questions if we have time. So let's jump </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">right into HTML5 and Chrome. So you saw some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">of this in the keynote but I just want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">reiterate it, why Chrome as sort of a developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">platform? Well, here's a &mdash; here's an interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">graph. So you can see the initial beta of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">Chrome all the way down to Chrome 9. And this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">is a benchmark of the V8 JavaScript engine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">that Chrome runs. This is the &mdash; the version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">five of that benchmark. But you can tell that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">the &mdash; obviously, the bigger bars mean better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">and better performance. So over the last releases, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">I mean, we just keep getting faster and faster </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">and faster. This is why applications like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">Gmail and these big JavaScript-heavy and JavaScript-centric </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">applications work and work really well. Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">has 70 million plus active users. That's something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">we announced at Google I/O. And that number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">is only getting bigger. So if you're targeting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">Chrome, if you're targeting it for the Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">Store, you have a huge potential user base </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">to reach. Stable channel update happen every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">six weeks. So, we are iterating on this thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">lighting fast. And it's really nice that all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">browser vendors now are competing. You have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">Safari, you have Firefox, you have IE9 and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="164">Chrome sort of driving the Web forward and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="164">building these HTML5 APIs at lightning speeds. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="169">You have new Canary build on Windows that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">you can download. It's nightly build of Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">that you can test the latest and greatest, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">the bleeding edge features, as they come out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="177">I mentioned 400% JavaScript performance improvement. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="177">So just a &mdash; it's a really exciting space to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">be in. So why HTML5? Well, you've seen a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">of cool demos today. I did some of the keynote. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="189">We've talked about them a little bit. I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">just sort of break up this talk a little bit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="193">I'm going to switch to this mic and just show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">you a few cool demos throughout the entire </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">thing. This is one I actually found today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="199">So, this is using the Drag and Drop API that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">we demoed in the keynote but this one's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">little different. So let me find a nice image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">to drop on here. I'll do the Chrome logo. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="213">So this image data was read using the File </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">Reader API in JavaScript and you can tell, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">you know, it's the Chrome logo. It's all pixilated. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="231">But the really cool thing about this is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">it's using Canvas and it's breaking this image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">pixel data up because you can read the pixel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">level. And so, I can create a nice 3D cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">aspect of the &mdash; of the Chrome logo as I traverse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">around. Really kind of cool. He's also incorporated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">the device orientation API. So here's another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">example where I move the computer and it turns. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="253">Pretty neat. All right. So, that's why Chrome, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">why HTML5. Now, why the Web? Why would you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">want, if you're a desktop application software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">developer, why would you want to switch to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">the Web? Well, I think there's really three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">key reasons. The first one, there's &mdash; I mean, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">it's got &mdash; and maybe it's not obvious, I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">know. But the zero installment, right, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">can access your application &mdash; your users can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">access your application from anywhere and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">anytime on the Web; there's zero install. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="288">There's no friction in that. You know, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">get the latest security updates and features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">that you roll out. When you click "deploy," </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">they get the latest and greatest every time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="297">It's a seamless update. Cross-platform and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">device support; this one, you know, this one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">might be obvious, too. But obviously HTML5 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">is an emerging technology and it's still being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">built up by the various browsers. But in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">long term here, everyone's going to support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">it. It's going to be used across multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">platforms, maybe for the term right ones and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">run anywhere. Well, that's sort of the idea </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">behind, you know, the Web. But it's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">not just Chrome and the desktop, right? There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">different spaces. There's things like Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">and the smartphones that support HTML5 and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">these web technologies. There's also a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">product, Google TV, right, that launched which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">has Chrome built into it and a modern browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">that can run these cool technologies. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">you're running your apps not only on small </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">device but, say, a 40-inch screen. So it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">a very different type of application environment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">that you're used to. And, of course, those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">two products, in particular, share WebKit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">as the rendering engine. So you know if it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">works, say, in Safari. It's probably going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">to work in Chrome, Google TV, and Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">as well. So, what does a Web app look like? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">I mean, we've talked about sort of applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">on the Web. I think you guys kind of know. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="370">We use these everyday but here are sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">my ideas of what a good, solid Web application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">at least the kind that we're looking for for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">the Store, I have. So, one, it's goal-oriented. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="379">It should be very task-driven. You go there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">to serve a purpose and you maybe do &mdash; maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">it's a music player app and you're searching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">for music or you're playing music. It's very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">task-driven and focused. The UI is tight. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="396">It's beautiful and immersive. So, again, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">think, you know, as engineers we often get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">in this niche where we're not the best designers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">I would say, but if you hire a designer, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">guarantee you're going to have more traffic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="405">CSS3, you know, the graphical capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">in the HTML5 now are amazing. And so, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">can really make a beautiful and immersive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">site that sort of takes up the whole browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">space or whole rendering space on whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">device you're on. You should sort of get lost </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">in the UI. It shouldn't feel &mdash; it should feel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">like a native app basically. And in that regard, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">it should have a rich user experience. Lastly, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">it should be fast. I showed you the JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">performance graphs earlier. But there's also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">APIs that we talked about in some prior sessions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">that really make this stuff lightning fast; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">things like Offline, things like Web Workers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">and Web Sockets for real time communication. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="445">So, it should feel native but it's on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">Web. So now let me show you what I'm talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="459">This is a Web site. And I won't go to these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">sites, but this is &mdash; this will sort of give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">you sort of a general idea of what some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">these &mdash; what a Web app, in my opinion, looks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">like. So here's an example from the Associated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">Press. It &mdash; you go there for a reason. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="471">go there to read news articles. It's fully </span><span class="line" data-startTime="471">immersive. It's thinking about into things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">like rounding corners and all the cool stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">you can do in CSS. Another great example of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">a music player, Twitter app. I mean, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">look and feel like native, say, iPad apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">or iPhone apps but they're Web apps. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">one's really simple. I mentioned focus-driven </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">and very goal-oriented. You know, everytimezone.com, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">the whole purpose of the site is just to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">there if you forgot what time zone you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">in and how it translates to other time zones. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="504">But it's using things like SVG and Canvas </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">to present a really cool user interface. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">you get the idea, right? These are &mdash; these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">are Web apps but they look native and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">feel native. All right, I promised awesome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">demos to get you guys excited so here's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">second awesome demo. Actually, I need Firefox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">for this. So, Firefox, there's a new API in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">HTML5, it's the audio data API. And what that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">allows you to do is actually read data, say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">from an MP3 file as you're going to see in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">a second, and you can process that data and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">do anything with it you want. So you get the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">raw byte information from the data stream. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="554">You can also create audio on the fly using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">this API. So here's an example of using HTML5 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">audio. This is the audio tag and this is what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">it looks like rendered in Firefox and Canvas </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">to play an MP3 file. But at the same time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">it's rendering the spectrum of that sound. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="570">It's doing this on the fly in JavaScript in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">real time and it looks fantastic, right? I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">mean, there's no lag here whatsoever. I could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">play it all day, but I won't. Here's just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">another quick example of the auto data API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="585">This is also in Canvas. Is my sound out? Let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">me do a refresh. My &mdash; is my audio on in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">computer? Maybe not. But what you would hear </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">would be sound. As I press these different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">dots it generates a sound based on the color </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">pallet. So it's pretty cool, low to high based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">on sort of the frequency of the image. Maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">the auto data API was on mute for that particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">demo. So that's sort of setting up the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">Web Store, all that, you know, billing an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">app, what is an app, what does it look like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">how does it feel, how does it act, what technologies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">to use. So here &mdash; here's what the Chrome Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">Store is. And before I sort of talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">the Chrome Web Store, I want to talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">the current problem sort of on the Web today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="647">You have &mdash; I don't know about you guys but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">this is how my tab page looks every, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">afternoon after I've been at work for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">whole day. I have a couple different new sites </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">open. I have maybe &mdash; you see three instances </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">of Gmail open because I'm lost in my tabs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">and maybe I've signed in to different accounts. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="666">You know, I have new sites, I have apps, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">have Facebook open, I have TechCrunch; all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">these different &mdash; these applications that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">use, Facebook, and the readers and everything. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="675">It's different, the Web is different, much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">different than it used to be. These are not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">sites anymore, these are apps. People are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">spending all their time in these. So the Browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">UI really hasn't sort of kept up with this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">pace of innovation and thinking along these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="687">same lines, it's not ideal for the scenario. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="687">Same thing with permissions. So a lot of really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">neat HTML5 APIs like Geolocation, Storage, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">Notifications API. There's some other ones </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">in the pipeline, like device access will be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">something that will require permission. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">it requires user interaction in order to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">this stuff work. So what you end up with, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="708">if you have this really killer app that has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="708">all these awesome APIs, you know, on page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">load, you get four or five permissions and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">it's ugly. I don't know about you guys but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">that's not ideal user experience. So we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">do better. The last problem of the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">Web Store &mdash; I hope in saying to solve, is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">you have all these users out there. And if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">you do a search for Google.com today &mdash; I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">putting a really cool animation. If you do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">a search for Google.com today, right, you &mdash; and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">you find the best photo app or something, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">photo sharing app. You know, you're not necessarily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">going to get the best photo sharing app out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">there, Google Search is not ideal for discovering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">applications on the Web. So you have all these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">apps, you have all these developers, how do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">you sort of connect them together for developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">to reach a new market? And of course, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">sort of where the Chrome Web Store comes in. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="762">So the Web Store is going to be about discoverability, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">right? You should be able to find the killer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">apps you want, install them on a Chrome. Or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">in general, it's any browsers that you access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">the store and you should be able to find those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">applications. And the best ones will surface </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">to the top based on user ratings and reviews. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="777">So if your app is killer, if you're a small </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">time developer, you know, your app can rise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">to the top if you do a good job and users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">like what they're seeing. It's all about distribution, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">so reaching those users. Auto-update for package </span><span class="line" data-startTime="792">apps. We'll talk about package apps in a bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="792">but it's the same auto-update. If any of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">went to the Chrome extensions talk earlier, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">Chrome extensions, once you upload them to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">the gallery and upload a new version they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">are auto-updated for all users of your extension. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="806">So the same thing will be true for packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">apps for the Chrome Web Store. If you, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">know, hit deploy, if you hit publish to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">Web Store, your applications will get updated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="815">for all users of your app. So that's pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="815">cool. Obviously, revenue for developers is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">huge. You know, you can make money off a Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">app. That's kind of a new idea, I would say. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="826">And themes and extensions will be part of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">this too. So you'll be able to sell extensions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">you will be able to sell themes as well. Themes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">meaning, themes for Google Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="831">So the whole process of publishing app on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">the Web Store, you're in complete control. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="843">So we don't do, you know, app approval or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">anything like that. You pay a one time registration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">fee and you're all set, you can go ahead and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">publish. Unless your app does something malicious </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">or it's flagged by users, you know, we won't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">interact, we won't intervene at all. So you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">create the app, you upload it to the store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">and you provide the product information. There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">things like screenshots and videos, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">you get published, and you reach users and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">sell your application. So it's very frictionless. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="872">We have a payment system set-up with a licensing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">API that you can talk to. Who's installed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">my app, you know, to make sure they're valid </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">users for the hosted apps at least. It uses </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">OpenID and OAuth, so two technologies that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">are open standards using RESTful API. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">we also provide things like analytics in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">store. So, you know, how many times did this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">user or how many times did this user &mdash; people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">have installed this application, uninstalled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">it, viewed the listing page, and so on and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">so forth. So, there's this been this asterisk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">here on all the payment stuff for a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">slides now, that's because when we do launch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">the store later in the year, you have to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">a U.S. bank account in order to publish on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="914">a store. So, until it's &mdash; this sort of officially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="914">launched in Brazil, you won't have the ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="922">to publish an application. But you can prepare </span><span class="line" data-startTime="922">yourself for it. And I do recommend you do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">that. We'll talk about how. I just want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">mention, when we do launch, they'll be, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">know, free. You can have a free application. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="930">You can pay to install so a user can choose </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">to pay a one time fee to install your application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="935">There'll be subscriptions both monthly and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">annually. There'll be a freemium model so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">you can upload a free version of apps so the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="945">users can have a trial version. If they like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="945">your app they can choose to install the premium </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">version. And then you can choose your own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">adventure. So, you're not, again, locked in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">to any technology or any payment solution. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="953">You can use your own. You can even sell your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="958">app on your own, you know, server if you wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="958">to, there's no restrictions. But the, again, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">the benefit of the store here is that, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">the discoverability and ease of integration. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="967">So what can you do to prepare if you can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="967">sell anything. Before I do that, I want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="972">show you another cool example because they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="972">awesome. I'll make sure I have sound. Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="988">Okay, so this is also using the audio data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">API. This is our &mdash; basically what they've done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">is, is create a sound sampler, and I'll just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">play it for you right now using a &mdash; what is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="997">it, the D key or S key. Let me try to refresh. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="997">Can you guys hear that? Could you turn that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1012">up a little bit? So this is reading an MP3 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1012">file and then producing a spectrum. But what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">I can do using Audio Data API I ran, I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">sample different portions. I can also read </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">this thing backwards if I wanted to and really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">get the full effect there. But just &mdash; certainly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1040">the capabilities of things you can do with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1040">audio and video and multimedia HTML5, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">pretty amazing. Okay, I'm done with the audio, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">thank you. All right, so I've mentioned installation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1061">How do you install a Web application? In Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">at least, if users visit the store and see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">your listing and want to, you know, purchase </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">your user free application, they can install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1074">their app &mdash; your application inside of Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1074">So this is an image of what the new tab page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1079">will probably or might look like and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1079">is available in the developer channel of Chrome. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">So, you can install applications. And basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">what it is it has this big icon, a launch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1090">icon to your app so you just can access, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1090">know, their favorite applications really quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1094">And so there will also be a link to the store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">where they can find and discover new ones. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1101">So I mentioned the launcher. This is, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">know, an example of what an icon would look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">like and the options that are available to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">you. Users have the full choice to sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">open the application regular tab in Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">Chrome. Excuse me. It can open as a pin tab </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1116">so they can actually sort of move the app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1116">over to side by itself so it's away from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">rest of the tabs sort of to minimize that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">clutter that you saw. Or they can choose to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">run full screen which is kind of cool for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">things like games, or hopefully not uninstall </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">your apps. So that's why that one's pushed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">down so far. Unless there's &mdash; there's also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">an option to have sort of a pop-up panel UI. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1137">So if you have something, maybe like a count &mdash; a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">calculator widget or a clock, you can run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">that in a little panel pop-up. The tab and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1146">the panel are something you can programmatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1146">choose. The pin tab and full screen are just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">something the user has to manually select </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">from this list. But what this allows you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">do &mdash; so, it's got the convenient new tab page, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">but it simplifies the permissions model. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">if you have an app that uses Geolocation, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">Notifications and Storage, it's basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1165">just, you know, do you trust this application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1165">click to install and that's it. They don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">have to grant access to all these different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">APIs separately. It's sort of at the trust </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">level of the store and installing application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">and you hereby say that you trust the application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">to do whatever it needs to do. So let's talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">about hosted apps. Hosted apps are probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">going to be, in my opinion, they're super </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">easy to create for the store. If you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">an existing Web site, it's literally a matter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">of wrapping that existing Web site in a manifest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">file. Very similar to extensions, it's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">the same model. So if you have a Web site, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1199">you add some metadata to it and boom you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1199">done. You upload to the store and you've already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1204">created the app, right, there's nothing else </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1204">to do. But what it does is you have the &mdash; all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1209">the permissions. So this is what, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1209">a pop-up would look like. This app, Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1214">Maps, running in the Web Store would require </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1214">your physical location for the Geolocation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1219">and storage for offline access. And so, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1219">click to install. There's three permissions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">right now, I mentioned them before. As new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">APIs become available they'll be added to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1229">the list as well. So how do you &mdash; if you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1229">a Web app that exists on the Web today, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">do you detect that the user has installed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">this application? How do you know they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1238">launching it from Chrome instead of just visiting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1238">you know, the app from a URL or a bookmark? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1244">And what we'll have available for you is &mdash; it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1244">not really an API, but it's a property. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">Window Chrome app is installed, you can check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">that. If that property exists on the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1254">app object then you know the user's installed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1254">the app. And then, they paid money if they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">purchased it or if it's free. Otherwise, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">know, they're just visiting it as a normal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">user without install. So you can display maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">a different UI, you can display, "Would you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">like to purchase this app?" or something. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">So, let me just demo this and show you what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1274">this looks like. I have taken the liberty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1274">and spent countless hours in creating a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1280">nice demo application. It runs on my local </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1280">machine right now but obviously, this could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1285">be any domain, any Web site. On the Web, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1285">could wrap Google.com if we want it to. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">could wrap Google Maps if we wanted to in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">a hosted app. But I will show you what this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1294">looks like in all of its glory. So the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1294">thing you'll notice is that this is just a, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1301">you know, helloworld.html. And this is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1301">really a Web app. It's just a static page. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1304">But it happens to use a lot of cool HTML5 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1304">APIs. This is text. This is using the fonts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">API and all that good CSS stuff. But you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">notice that the first thing when the page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1315">loads, it wants to use Geolocation. So I get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1315">the browser pop-up, right? This app wants </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">physical access to your location. So I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">say, "Yes," because I do trust this app, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">built it. And for some reason, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">it's putting us in the water. That's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1329">interesting. So, it's probably because of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1329">the Ethernet. Oh, fantastic. Well, we got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1337">close to Brazil, okay. Let me try that again. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1337">I want to see. The wireless is probably more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">accurate but I assure you Geolocation does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">work. So, let's say that worked. Now it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1349">got my location. I've granted it permission. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1349">But this app, you know, it's, obviously, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1355">not ideal but it also wants to send notifications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1355">So when I hit "send notification," right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1361">I get another dialogue. And you get the point, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1361">right? This is kind of annoying. In order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1365">to really experience this app I have to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1365">through all these hurdles. So, now that I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1371">obviously done that I can send notifications. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1371">It's an HTML5 notification. This last one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1376">is using the FileWriter API, which is a brand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1376">new API that recently landed in Chrome, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1382">Chrome dev channel. So you can actually write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1382">files and write directories and read directories </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1386">and files using Javascript. And the reason </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1386">I'm getting code exceeded error here is because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1390">I don't have the proper permission set. Right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1390">now in Chrome, at least for the foreseeable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1396">near future, you have to be an application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1396">and request the permission in your manifest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1400">file in order to write and read files. I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1400">show you the code for that just so you believe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1406">me. So I'm not out putting random text. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1406">So this is what the file looks. This is what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1406">an API looks like. There's a new sort of method </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1421">on the window object. So I can request the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1421">file system, I want temporary file access. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1427">I'll give it a size and then I, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">give success and error callbacks. The success </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1433">callback will take the file system object </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1433">that's passed to that callback and it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">basically do a get file. If it finds that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">file, it will try &mdash; excuse me, if it finds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1442">that file, it will try to read it, otherwise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1442">since I have this create "true," if it doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">exist I'll try to create it. In this case, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">it doesn't exist on my local storage system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1451">so I get that code exceeded error. So, my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1451">error callback is handed &mdash; or is handled instead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1456">of the success callback. And you can do other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1456">things like read directories and whatnot, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">but that is not the point. Last thing I wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">to show is that I am making that check for &mdash; if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">this app is installed using the easy install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">parameter. So you can sell the message here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">You know, this launch, this was normally &mdash; this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">app was launched via bookmarker or link so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">I just navigated to this page. Okay, so that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">a normal web app, I've already built that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1486">Let's see what this looks like as installable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1486">hosted application. So the first thing you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1492">going to do is create a manifest.json file. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1492">So the exact same process as creating an extension. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1497">You give a name, you know, description of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1497">your app, you have logos. There's various </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">logos you can provide for the store, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">one for the launcher icon, there's one for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1505">fab icon, there's one for, you know, the listing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1505">in the store itself. So you have a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1509">flexibility and options there. But the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1509">property for the store itself is this app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1515">object, this app JSON object. And the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1515">property in there is the launch URL. The launch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">URL is the URL of your application. So if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">I was to just package this app, this app that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1526">I created, you know, in 10 minutes for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1526">Web Store, this is all I would need to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1530">I would just need to write, you know, these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1530">10 lines of JSON, package that up, upload </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1535">it to the store and boom, I'm done. But if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1535">users are using Chrome they can obviously </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">have a better experience. So the first thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">optionally that we can do, I mentioned that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1548">you can launch in different modes. You can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1548">launch as panel app, you can give it a size </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1552">and a width. By default, it's tabs so we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1552">just leave that out. But I mentioned permission. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1557">So again, just like the extensions there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1557">different permission bits that you can set. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1562">My app is going to have Geolocation unlimited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1562">storage for FileWriter and also notifications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1567">So I can set those inside the manifest file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1567">so I can say this app will need these permissions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1573">And those permissions will apply to any URLs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1573">that I list in the URLs array under the app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">object. So any URLs basically get the white-listing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">of these permissions. If you're not within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1586">this list then you don't have unlimited storage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1586">notifications for Geolocation. So to show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1596">you this in action, I will close this. I could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1596">keep it open, but I'll close it. Using the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">Chrome extensions API, I will navigate to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">my app. So I'm just basically uploading or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1611">loading up an unpackaged application. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1611">got all my files in there. You know, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">a helloworld.html, there's a HTML file for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">the notification and there's the manifest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1620">file. I'll click select and actually, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1620">already here so it didn't do anything. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">I'll enable that application. And so, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">first thing you notice is my first app is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1635">available now in my new tab page. So I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1635">choose to launch this in different modes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1640">or I can just see what this looks like when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1640">I launch it. So, you notice a couple of things. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">Just to prove that this does work, I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">refresh this page. I just got rid of the Geolocation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1654">permission. I said I don't want to access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1654">the Geolocation anymore, but since I'm a Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1659">app now, since I'm an install-hosted app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1659">it's automatically got the Geolocation. I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">can send notifications without a permission </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">setting to pop-up. There it is. And you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">a new message here. You see log file created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">so the file system API is actually working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">now. We can create files because we have that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">permission set. And obviously, at the bottom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">there, you know, we're making the check to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">see if we're installed via the app store using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1683">the Chrome Web Store and indeed, we are. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1683">a better user experience but very trivial. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1688">I added three permissions to this web app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">to make it a better experience for all users. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1693">It's just fantastic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1693">So that was hosted apps. But there's another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1693">type of app called a packaged app. And packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1707">apps are very similar to Chrome extensions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1707">In fact, they basically are glorified Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1712">extensions. So you have a normal Web site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1712">but you add some extra metadata and you wrap </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">it up in a CRX file, which is basically a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">zip file. It supports auto-updating so, again, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">when you upload a new version in the store, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">all your users are auto-updated. So, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1727">would you use this over hosted web application? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1727">Well, there's a couple of reasons. So if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1731">don't require a server for one. If you just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1731">want to package up a Flash game for instance, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">a SWF file, you can absolutely do that. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">you don't want to &mdash; or you don't have a server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">component that you want to talk to or host </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">that application anywhere. You can just choose </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">it, choose to upload it to the Web Store and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">boom, it's there, and then people can download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">it from there. There's tighter integration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">with Chrome so we'll talk about some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">APIs that are available to the packaged apps. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">And they have elevated permissions because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">they're packaged. They're installed in Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">whereas a Web app doesn't have that same liberty. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1762">And lastly, if you don't care about supporting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1762">other browsers, I mean, that's fine. You know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1767">if you want to just start at Chrome, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1767">totally cool. It's just like an extension. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1770">It will only be run in Chrome so you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">have to worry about sort of developing for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1776">all these different browsers. But there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1776">more things you can do with in a packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">app. So you have full access to all the extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">APIs, except browser action and page action. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1785">How many people went to the extensions talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">by the way? A few people? Okay. So page action </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">and browser actions are the little icons that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">appear when you install a Chrome extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1797">in the top right corner of the browser that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1797">do interaction. Again, you can do things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1802">content scripts and background pages. Content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1802">scripts inject the Javascript or CSS onto </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1807">a page based on a set of rules that you specify. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1807">Background pages are great for things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1812">polling. You can do cross-domain XHR request, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1812">which is pretty cool, in background pages. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1817">Obviously, that's not something a normal web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1817">application can do because of the restrictions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1822">But there's really much, much more. So you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">can write a packaged, you know, Web app for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1827">the Chrome Web Store that does things with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1827">context menus. So you can modify the right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">click menu and add your options there. Tab </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">and window manipulation, Omnibar, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">tie into the Chrome's URL bar with your own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">API, it provides search results or do what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1840">ever you want there. History, bookmarks and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1840">cookies, these are thing that, at least bookmarks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">and history, that, you know, normal Web app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">can't do but a Chrome extension has a permission. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1856">So that's sort of an overview of the Web Store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1856">And I've mentioned, you know, you heard a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1863">lot about &mdash; you heard a lot of preaching about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1863">HTML5 today. And a lot of people think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1867">not ready, there's been some posts recently. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1867">I would say it is ready and it's definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1873">ready to experiment with at the very least. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1873">Here's a picture of 2008, the browser support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">in 2008, for various APIs. So you have Geolocation, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">forms, you know, Web Workers. It's very sparse. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">So this is two years ago. One year ago, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">getting a lot better. So, you know, Chrome2 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1892">comes along. It's got most support here. Firefox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1892">is catching up, IE is still kind of lagging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1897">behind. But by 2010, you just can see this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1897">graph really starting to fill out, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1902">So most WebKit browsers have pretty much everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1902">implemented. You know, Firefox4 is there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1907">I guess you did, wow, cool. So you edited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1907">IE9. So IE9 is doing a fantastic job with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1912">a lot of these APIs, video, audio for example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1912">SVG. So you can imagine in a year, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">where this is going to be. It's just absolutely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">ridiculous how fast the innovation is happening. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1922">Time for an awesome demo. So you saw &mdash; you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1922">seen the device orientation API a lot today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1939">Here is another example of, you know, using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1939">an interactive game. So I can speed this up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">if I tilt it forward. Anyway, I have three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">lives so hopefully it would be fast because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1949">this is the best I've ever done, promise. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1949">I'll try something tricky. [MAKES NOISE] But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">now this is &mdash; now that this stuff is all native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">to the browser, right, you really have different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1965">interactions with applications then ever before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1965">I will just kill myself, no? Well, you get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1976">the point. There we go. Seven twenty-seven, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1976">it's not too bad. So here is the current browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">share as of September 2010. And just soaked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">this in for a little bit. This is sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1995">the state right now. You know, it's not September </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1995">anymore so the numbers have change a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1999">bit. But in general, you get the idea. Modern </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1999">browsers are taking up, you know, a good chunk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2006">of that. But for the most part, people running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2006">IE6, 7 and 8. Which is fine but the problem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2010">is you can't leverage these cool APIs and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2010">target those browsers, it's just impossible. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2015">So what you do as a developer is you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2015">to hack around things, right? This is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2020">Acid3 test rendered by Chrome. And here's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2020">what it looks like rendered by IE6, I believe. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2027">So again, between thes two different versions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2027">say this is the layout and color scheme of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">your site, you know, you have all cool CSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">tricks and then &mdash; but other users are seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2036">this, that's not ideal, they get the score </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2036">of 20 out of 100. So products like Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2042">Wave for instance, just as an example, did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2042">something, you know, they choose not to support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">IE6 anymore because the development cost is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">way too much. You end up having to have JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2052">hacks and, you know, spending way more time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2052">than you need to working around these issues. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2059">So Wave chose to do is have a prompt. So if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">you're in one of these &mdash; if you're in Internet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">Explorer let's just not support you at all. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">We have too many, you know, awesome capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2069">that you can access. So go ahead and install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2069">Google Chrome Frame and Google Chrome Frame </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2075">is a plug-in. If &mdash; we probably talked about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2075">this way too much today, but that's because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2080">a lot of people don't know about it, unfortunately. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2080">Google Chrome Frame is a plug-in that users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">install for IE. And basically what it does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">is if you imagine the browser of IE6, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">example, I think it's not IE6 but this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">the image I found, the user installs the plug-in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">and the entire rendering portion. So anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">in the tab, the actual Web page itself, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">all rendered with a Chrome rendering engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2101">So you get things like CSS3, you get things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">like Geo location. All the stuff that's not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">in that older browser, you get for free. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2111">also get speed and performance. You get the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2111">security and sandbox of Google Chrome, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">is one of the best in my opinions. And it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">auto-updated along with Chrome, so they get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">the latest and greatest when the plug-in, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">the new plug in is pushed. And that includes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2125">things like the &mdash; integrated Flash in the PDF </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2125">or inside of Chrome. So also open source so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">you can go check out the code if you want. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">As a developer, it really literally couldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2137">be any easier to put this thing with inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2137">of your app, with inside of your site. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2142">if you are writing a hosted app and you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2142">other users, not just Chrome users, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2146">IE6 users for example, to access these APIs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2146">in your Web app to its full potential, all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2153">you have to do is include a meta tag on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2153">HTML page using the chrome=1 for the content. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2159">Or if you can't, you know, add that to every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2159">page you can send a header with the same value </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2164">there. Super simple. The only problem with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2164">this is that the user has to have the plug-in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2168">installed. So if they don't then there's no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2168">benefit there. But there's zero cost you as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2175">a developer. So that was sort of a high level </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2175">overview of the Chrome Web Store. I just want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2181">to mention that, you know, we talked &mdash; I showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2181">you an application, sort of how do you package </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2186">it for a hosted app, talked a little bit about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2186">package apps. But the building an app for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2191">the store is your choice, right? There's no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2191">limitation on technology whatsoever. You can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2195">choose one from the Web stack, you know, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2195">open Web stack platform. But you can write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2198">a Flash game. You can use a Silverlight, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2198">plug in. You can do things like native client, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2203">which is running C++ in the browser. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2203">a Chrome-specific thing but again, it's your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2208">choice of technology. So anything you want, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2208">a LAMP stack, you know, choose your own adventure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">if you will. So I think the takeaways here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">are that the Web is innovating, right? We're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">seeing things like you saw it all today, HTML, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">JS and hardware acceleration. There's literally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">a parity with the desktop now. And I guarantee </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">you within six months to a year, you're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2229">to have things like device integration. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2229">you can access the microphone, and USB drives, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">and all that great stuff, camera, for instance, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">using the webcam. So don't wait until 2022 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">that &mdash; that's I think what the W3C said when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">the HTML5 will finally be ready. I assure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2248">you it's out there and living well. And I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2248">think with the pace of innovation that's happening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">right now were really seeing that in action. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">Features are first class citizens. You know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">things like video and audio we take for granted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">with Flash and in other plug-ins. But now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2260">we've the ability to do these and manipulate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2260">them using JavaScript inside of the &mdash; in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2264">native platform. The Chrome Web Store is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2264">great way to monetize your applications, your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2268">existing application. Or create entirely a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2268">new one, right? And if users are visiting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2273">the Web Store in Chrome and they choose to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2273">install the app then they have a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2276">better experiences if you, you know, set up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2276">the manifest file correctly. And you can finally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2280">monetize an application on the Web, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2280">is pretty exciting. So your HTML5 investment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2285">will be rewarded. A couple of essential links. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2285">You know, here's the documentation links for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2291">Web Store, for Web apps in relation to Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2291">Store extensions. But do stay in touch. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">can follow us in Twitter. Our developer operations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">team is @ChromiumDev. We tweet a bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2304">great stuff there.
