<h2>Alex Komoroske, Dimitri Glazkov</h2>

<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/2txPYQOWBtg">youtu.be/2txPYQOWBtg</a><div id="transcript"><p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Let's get started. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Let's get started. So what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="5">the heck of Web components? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="5"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So When you guys saw that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">word component, you probably thought what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">is that? Well, I submit that each and every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="18">one of you know what a component is because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="18">you use them today. You use them in lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">different cases. So the first case is in embedded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">widgets. So here if you have a Google+ button </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">inside your site or a like button or something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">like that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60"> Dimitri Glazkov: Or a Twitter button. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="60"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: This is a third-party bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">of code that's running within your site. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">something where you have trust issues, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">They don't want to allow you to mess with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">all of their stuff or (indiscernible) privileged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">APIs, and they also don't want you to style </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">their stuff. So they talk a lot about discipline. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">Like, "Thou shalt not use anything under &mdash; sell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">anything under my little ID" and stuff like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="117"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Right, and of course we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">as user of those widgets go, "Eh, it's more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">like an etiquette." Try not to do that stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">and we'll mess with that the way we want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">to make it look nice. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="163"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: And so in fact, what everybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">does, they give up on these iframes, but that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">not really ideal. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">So another use case is when you are writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">your own app, and say you want a tabstrip, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">well, you shouldn't have to create a tabstrip </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">because there are thousands of them that other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">people have created; you just want to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">those. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">So you just want to grab in a widget or a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">component that someone else has written, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">put it inside of your app. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="230"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: And there are entire libraries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">written nowadays, and some of them are quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">complete, libraries, and widgets and all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">the different UI elements that you might want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">to put together. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">And of course, unfortunately, the problem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">there is that all of these libraries espouse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">their own strategy on how to execute the UI </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">widget composition and how those things come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">together. And so like one of the top stock </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">overflow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">questions would be how do I use the widget </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">from Framework Foo in Framework R, right? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="273"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Unfortunately, they follow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">different conventions, so often the answer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">is you use a lot of duct tape, a lot of script, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">jam them together as best you can. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="288"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Don't touch those parts. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="297"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: And don't do this, whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">you do. So the final one is custom-built widgets. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">Are you hungry? So bear with me for a second. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">You are all familiar with spaghetti code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">right? Where you have all of these crazy stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">to do, really hacky. When you are writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">your own apps, you want to have this better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">fit of encapsulation, right? Because that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">how you build more complex things. But it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">hard to do in the above platform, so the best </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">that you can kind of get is lasagne. You've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">got layers, but they're still kind of messy, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">right? So even when you are building any kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">of app, you are building these custom elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">for yourself. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="367"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: The components is, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">know, one use of that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="373"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So let's go dive into our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">example we will be talking through today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="381">We're going to build a poll app and show you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">how we built this today. So here it is. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">a pretty app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="403">It's got a cool HTML file logo, it's got a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">title, a subtitle, different options. If you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">aren't familiar with them, you can hover over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">them to see the information about them. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">can select them. I selected things. You can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">also see the results. See what other people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">have voted for. But let's dive into how this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">stuff actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">works. So I'm going to open up Web inspector </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">I have got this way zoomed in, which is why </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">it looks so funky. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="451"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: And if you look at this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">today, and this is a written &mdash; you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">this is a pretty cutting edge technology even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">by today's standard. Shout out for David who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">wrote this code. It's using what you would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">call the modern </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">principles of Web design, and that is, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">know, you do see your components right away. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="474">You see the poll is one component, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">a backbone view; and then you see the choices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">view, results view, and all of those different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">things that are put together into a widget </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">hierarchy of some sort, right? Unfortunately, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">some of the things immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">start jumping out at you and going what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">going on here? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">See those strings there? Your HTML became </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">just a string, right? It's not a markup anymore. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="502">It's just the cottage cheese in your Lasagne, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">And so at this point you are starting to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">and say, "Well, I'm not really working in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">HTML anymore; I'm working in this parallel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">world that the framework has designed for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">me. And then what happens is this framework </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">will do the right thing and project the actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">HTML or DOM tree into the browser for user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">to see. And, of course, when the user clicks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">on something, the backward thing happens, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">you know. The framework traverses the events </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">back to your tree to your object hierarchy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">and tells you what happened. It's not just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">the deal that was clicked; it's your poll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">that was selected. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="540">Ah-ha, I understand this now. So if you look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">at this markup right now, you actually see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">this very clearly. It's that markup is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">necessarily representative of what the poll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">is; it's actually a lot of things in addition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">to just what should be a very simple widget </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">layout, right? You have poll and you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">choices and that's it. What else should be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">going on here? But there is actually a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">of markup going on. That's because the markup </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">is essentially a projection. And even worse, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">today, if you load this page, it's just a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="579">DIV in markup. What happens is the framework </span><span class="line" data-startTime="579">then blows up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">this DIV using the JavaScript and creates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">the actual framework out of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="590">So &mdash; you think this is bad? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="590"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Right. So I actually have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">something that haunts my nightmares, and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">will haunt yours, too, after I show you. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">So if you open &mdash; if you go to, say, just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">Gmail which we all use, know and love, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">you switch and look at the Web inspector in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">here, you inspect some random elements &mdash; what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">is going on? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="614"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Oh, my God! What is this? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">This should be a very simple widget tree, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">right? There's like a list of things and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">there's &mdash; oh, my God look at this! Stairway </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">to hell. [Laughter] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="631"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Right? What's going on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="631">there? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="634"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: This doesn't make any sense. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="634">And so &mdash; this is in this bizarro. You know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">I bet a lot of you watching this were saying, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">"Oh, well that's just how you do it, right?" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">Like, why are you talking about why this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">insane? This is just how you make it work. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">You know what, Dimitri? I submit that everyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">in this room who said that is insane. Right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">[Laughter]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="666"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: This is insane, this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">crazy. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="669"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: We're insane, yay! All </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">right. But the thing is that &mdash; it is true, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">doing something to work around the issues </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">in the browser. And we're writing a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">code. We're writing frameworks to help us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">do this &mdash; these bits of code. Then with more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">code that we write, we have more opportunities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">for &mdash; for losing test coverage, for example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">and not knowing exactly what's happening. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="705">And clearly more code you ship over the wire, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="716">the slower your application will go, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="716">And the development time suffers, of course. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="725">Unless you stay in the confines of that specific </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">framework, right? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="729"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So that's sort of on a low </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">level why this is bad. On a high level, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">is bad, too. Right? If you looked at this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">DOM, this isn't very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">symmetric at all. I had to look through it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">I didn't really understand what those things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">were doing. The Gmail example, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">is way on one end of the spectrum. But actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">if we look at our index, Google, we see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">Web is getting less and less semantic as we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">go. There's more DIVs and spans. It's harder </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">to understand what's going on. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="771"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: And more empty DIVs, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">I mentioned before, right? You try to index </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">a page, you go there, you say, oh, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">nothing there, no, no, that's actually an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">NPR app but loads all kinds of images. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">have to run script to understand that it does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">that, right? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="790"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So running script means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">that you have to &mdash; to make any kind of complicated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">app, you have to run script. You can't be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">a web author; you have to be a Web developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">to make something work today. Okay. So I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">one bit of good news. You guys are all insane, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">but it's not your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">fault. It's the fault of the platform right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">now and that's why you have to do these things. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="843"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: That's right. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="843"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So if you look at this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">the rare thing of it, is the Web platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">has all of these amazing technologies that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">do all kinds of really cool stuff. But there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">are a few little potholes. A few little tiny </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">things that don't work correctly or that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">difficult. And you run into them. You're on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">this information super highway, everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">is working great, you run into a pothole, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">and you say, "Ooop, I can't handle this." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">But that's okay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="877">I have script, I have an escape hatch. I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">do this in JavaScript. It will be okay. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">you go a little tiny bit off road. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">fine, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">Now you run into another pothole, a deeper </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">pothole offroad. This means you're offroad, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="890">right? And it's a pothole that wouldn't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="890">been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">there had you been on the highway, had you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">been able to use these normal technologies, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">but you're offroad. That's okay. You write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">a little bit more script, you go a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="902">bit more offroad. Things are wrong, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="902">Unfortunately, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">leads into a pit of despair, right? Like the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">more offroad you go, after a certain point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">you are drawing your own cursor, you've completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">escaped the browser here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="913">[Laughter]. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="913"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: You are sort of building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">inside this escape hatch. JavaScript is an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">escape hatch. If the (indiscernible) doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="922">do what you need, you are now building everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="922">inside of the escape hatch. That's crazy. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">Even if you don't think that you are doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">it, you think you are doing a very good job </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">of being semantic and all of that stuff, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">the framework they are using is doing it for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="945">you. They are going completely offroad to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="945">do this kind of stuff. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="949"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Right. And a lot of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">framework becomes so robust. And in order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">to become robust, in order to offer the experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">to you that makes sense, they build entire </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">rendering engines into the browser, so you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">have this turducken of the thing. The rendering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">engine is just a rendering surface, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">there's another one that's being loaded to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="968">the js file that actually does the stuff for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="968">you. And so it's pretty sad. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="973"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So, yeah, we've been talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="973">all doom and gloom so far. We're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="977">turn the page here, and the good news is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="977">although we look like normal people, Dimitri </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">and I actually come to you from the future. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">[Laughter] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="986"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Yes. We did come from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="986">future. You must know there are multiple versions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">of the future, and there is one, for example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">where the alien invasion begins in 15 minutes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">and the Web platform essentially becomes irrelevant. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="993"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: But there also good time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">lines. The time line we're from is the one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">where there's free beer and there's Web components, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">so it's not all bad. So what we want to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">is we want to talk to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">you about how Web components solves this problem. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1003"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: So the Web components is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">this new set of technologies that we looked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">at &mdash; we created by looking at those potholes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">and decided to fill them naturally as things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">that fit inside of the Web platform as a whole. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1026">Rather than building a whole new crazy thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">on the side, which we always have done before, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">we decided we're going to fill those holes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">naturally into something that feels like just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">part of the Web platform. Just part of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">standard things that you normally do in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">browser. Not a script and not some crazy invention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">that is completely brand new. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1050">And so what we did is we kind of found out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1050">that there's three pieces that are missing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1056">and these pieces are Shadow DOM, the custom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1056">elements, and the templates. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1061"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So let me walk you through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">what each of these ones means in practice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1067">So again, all of these three things are what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">come underneath the umbrella of Web components. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1072">So the first is Shadow DOM. Shadow DOM is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1072">what allows you to encapsulate stuff in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">DOM to hide away all of that crush that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">need to make it look correct. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1080">Custom elements is what allows you to define </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1080">your own tabs. When the HTML parser runs into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1087">your widget, it can instantiate it immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1087">for you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1091">Finally, templates allows you to define HTML </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">DOM snippets very easily. So today you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1097">doing this in long bits of strings and script, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1097">or you are doing script tags with some &mdash; with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">some templates there. This basically just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">allows you to define it directly in your HTML, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">have it sort of frozen off to the side, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">you can swap it in when you need it. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1120"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: It's kind of neat to decide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">that developers are &mdash; really like this master </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">framework, right. There's problems with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">Web platform, but no matter what, developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">force will work around them or flow around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">those problems. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1131"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: They will find a way. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1131"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Exactly. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1134"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So this is sort of like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1134">the low level what the technologies do, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">what does this actually mean in practice? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1141"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Well, in practice, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">you are really are looking for is something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">that allows you to tell &mdash; allows you to tell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">the browser exactly what you mean. This, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">example, would be the markup that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1153">you are actually are trying to communicate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1153">to the browser. I have a poll, I have choices, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">and there's things that &mdash; that are essentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">data for my poll, right? Why should there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">be anything else? Right, right, right?!! </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1167"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Right! </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1170"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: All right! So the three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">pieces fit very neatly into this idea. First </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1177">Shadow DOM allows you to take the scaffolding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1177">all of the weird DIVs that are really irrelevant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">to the semantic of the markup, and hide them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">into the Shadow DOM &mdash; which we will talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">more about later. Then the custom elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">allow you to define new tags, right? New tags, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">awesome? X-poll, right? And specify behavior </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">and assign things on top of them. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1202">Then, of course, the templates allow you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1202">stop treating markup as string, which is always </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1209">nice. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1209"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So that's how they help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1212">tactically, but they also, of course, are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1212">really important on the high level. So if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">you have this world, this is all you need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">to pass down to the browser to have that rich </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1222">poll experience exist, that means that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1222">don't need this bizarro script. DOM can be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">your only hierarchy. You don't need to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">this parallel bizarro hierarchy on the side. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1229"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: You no longer need to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1229">your widget hierarchy as just a, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1233">an object tree somewhere off to the side. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1233">The one that projects the DOM is a kabuki </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">theater of some sort. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1237"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So DOM can become this lingua </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">franca of the Web. It also means that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">would have real encapsulation, so you wouldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">have to worry about people coming in and messing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">with your innards and messing up how your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">component works, because they can't because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">it would be a barrier. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1255">So it's not just etiquette or discipline. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1255">It's an actual encapsulation barrier. Also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">if DOM is the composition mechanism, it already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">composes really nicely. You can put a span, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">DIVs, all kinds of stuff, right? If you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">that as the framework that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">use for composability, that means that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">have compatible composability. So if you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">a widget from Framework A and Framework B, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">they can live together harmoniously without </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1278">having to figure out which widgets they have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1278">&mdash; it's just DOM. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1284"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Right. And where that one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1284">widget begins and where one widget ends. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">another important thing. Let's be clear. Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">components is not a set of those widgets. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1292">It's just a platform on which the future frameworks, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1292">you know, the future where we're from? Can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1295">build those new frameworks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1295"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So it's a foundation for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1296">this stuff. Okay. So this &mdash; actually, Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1296">components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">as you may have guessed, makes all of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">stuff real. So we're going to show you what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1309">it looks like in practice. So let me switch. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1309">This is the demo that we showed; it's built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">using the best practices of today. And this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">is what the &mdash; what the one with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">Web components looks like. Right? Looks exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">the same. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1323"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Yeah. Right. So in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1323">future, all applications are going to look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">exactly the same, right? This is the lesson </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">that we are learning? Well, actually, no. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1333">What's interesting here, this is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1333">a functional application, but instead of all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1337">of these weird spans and DIVs inside of it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1337">it has a very clear, very concise markup. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1341">This markup is exactly the same as the actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1341">DOM structure off this document, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">So whatever you ship over the wire is exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">the same thing that is represented as DOM. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1352">You don't have to create this thing that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1352">frameworks &mdash; the rendering decorate where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">you just first load the page and then you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">go find those things that you want to upgrade </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1363">and make them into the right stuff, you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1363">have to do that anymore. All of this happens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1370">magically? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1370"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Magically, that's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1372">a good point. I was going to ask, clearly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1372">we saw all of the extra stuff that's required </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1378">to make this poll demo work. But it's not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1378">here, so what's going on? All right. Well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1384">let's look. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1384"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: And kind of the way that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1388">you look at this is in the Web platform, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1388">never had this opportunity to &mdash; to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1393">in layering. Layering is like a cool thing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1393">It's not &mdash; it's also related to the lasagne </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">thing. But all of the frameworks, if you look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1401">them together, all of the JavaScript frameworks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1401">that are built out today are nothing but attempts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1409">to provide a layering in the browser. Because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1409">what they want to do is they want to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">an environment in which the users of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">framework don't have to think about the details. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1419">And then the developers of the new widgets, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1419">the builders of the components, the ones who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">work inside of the framework, actually have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">flexibility and power to, you know, provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1425">those new services to the &mdash; to the higher </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1425">level. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1425"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: By having this built into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1425">the browser, it means that there's no build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">step, there's no extra framework you can use, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">you might be able to build the users of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1435">components, which is what the vast majority </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1435">of the Web developers will be doing, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">super simple, you do an import, you use these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">tags, it just works, however, if you really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1451">want to understand the magic going on behind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1451">this, you need to go a little bit behind the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">scenes, you have to see these more powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">concepts that are a little bit more confusing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">that have a lot more to learn about. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1462"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: We have a choice here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">do you guys want to continue or should we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">just stop right here, behind the scenes!!?? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1473">Yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1473"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Okay. So we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">go behind the scenes. If at this point you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">say what the heck is going on, that's okay, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">you can just be a user of these components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">and not have to worry about it. Dimitri, why </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1487">don't you take us behind the scenes? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1487"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: First we're going to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">about Shadow DOM. Believe it or not, Shadow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">DOM already exists on the browsers, well and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">alive, and the one and good example would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">be a video tag. Let's take a look at this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">video tag right here embedded into this presentation, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">because, you know, our presentations are actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1505">HTML as well. Right? Okay. So as you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1505">you have really neat video tag right there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">right? Video/video, everything looks great, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">but there's actually more stuff happening. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1515">There's slider there in the time line, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1515">all these things. How do browser developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">do this? Right? How do they draw those things? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">Well, they have a couple of choices: One of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1525">them is build the whole thing from scratch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1525">to build their own, testing right into this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1531">thing, and we're kind of actually lazy and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1531">we didn't do that. What we did instead is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1536">we invented a way where we could stash away </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1536">a DOM tree where we can build those things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1541">out of just normal CSS and DOM, and operate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1541">on them just the normal way, and then we present </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1546">it to you as if this is a built-in functionality, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1546">and this DOM tree, we obviously called Shadow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1548">DOM, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1548">It's in the shadows. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1549"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So how can we see what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1549">going on here? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1552"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: So one of the interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1552">things is in Chrome browser, today you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1558">opt in to this experiment and you can say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1558">well, I want to be able to show Shadow DOM, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">and so if you're a load inspector, you will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">see that, when you inspect the video, suddenly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">there's more stuff inside of it. It's that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">thing called shadow root. That's that hidden </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">DOM that you can't see. Let's go inside of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">it. Oh, there's a DIV. Oh, interesting input </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">type button. That's actually the play button, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">and then the input type or this style, open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1587">that one right there, that will be a type </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1587">range. That's the slider, right? That's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">thing. So what we did is we really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">really cheated in a pretty big way, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">We just &mdash; instead of building all this stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">in C++, you know, and all this stuff, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1603">just DOM. And, in fact, when you play this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1603">video, and you know how the timeline goes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1607">away, that is just a CSS transition, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1607">It's nothing special. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1613"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So what you're saying is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1613">that this stuff, this isn't new, Shadow DOM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1618">has existed in some browsers already. What </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1618">is new is exposing it to web developers. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1623"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Right. So what we did next, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1623">we said, well, wouldn't it be cool if Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1629">developers could have the same power, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1629">wouldn't you agree that would be cool? Would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1630">that be cool? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1630">All right. So that's what Shadow DOM is about. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">It's about encapsulation and providing you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">with the ability to add these extra chunks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1635">on DOM tree and render them as if they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1635">part of the bigger rendering. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1639"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Okay. This is kind of complicated, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1639">so let's go through this in a little bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">depth. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1646"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: All right. Sounds good. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">So the next slide here that we see, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">a nice diagram. As you can see it's peas and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">radishes, clearly. So the green notes, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">peas represent the document tree, that's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1661">actual tree that you see when you go into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1661">the inspector, and that's the one that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">parsed, when the browser parses your markup, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">and the pink stuff is the Shadow DOM tree, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">so the Shadow DOM allows you to associate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">a special subtree with every DOM element, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">and then this subtree, you can build and create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">DIVs and all kinds of things inside of it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1686">but then when it's rendered, you actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1686">see the shadow subtree rendered instead of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1691">the contents of that node, the element that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1691">you associate it with. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1698"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Okay. So let me go over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1698">this one more time. So what we have here on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1703">the left, we have these green nodes, or just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1703">the logical DOM that we're all familiar with, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1709">and then off to the right we have a sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1709">parallel DOM hierarchy. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1716"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: That's right. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1716"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: And so it's sort of stashed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">off to the side. But if the Shadow DOM is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">defined, when we render, what we see, is as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1729">though the pink nodes were underneath the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1729">green nodes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1732"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: That's right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1732"> Alex Komoroske: So magically the green </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">ones are still there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1736"> Dimitri Glazkov: Right. So this is a really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">really cool concept right here, it's a render </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">time composition. You don't have to move those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">nodes around. They're still there &mdash; if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">walk your, you know, first child, next child </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">thing, next sibling, there's going to be only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">the green tree inside of it, but at render </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">time, the shadow DOM tree will be placed on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">top and rendered as if it's there. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1758"> Alex Komoroske: I had real stuff in that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1758">&mdash; in that real in the green DOM tree. I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">to show that. It's kind of weird this is sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">of (indiscernible) </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1767"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Right. Yeah, this use case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1767">is pretty good for a video, but you suddenly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">lost that other green peas things that were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">hanging off the element, so what do we do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1775">there? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1775">We have this really, really cool concept called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1777">insertion point. Insertion points are special </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1777">elements that you can put into your Shadow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1782">DOM subtree to designate where the children </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1782">of the shadow root will poke through, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1788">so as you can see there, I have two insertion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1788">points and when it's rendering, again at render </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">time only, those children will shine through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">inside of the Shadow DOM tree, so in a way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1796">it allows you to have this way to compose </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1796">the Shadow DOM subtree around your documents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1808">node. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1808"> Alex Komoroske: This is the same thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1810">that frameworks are doing today, right, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1810">you have like your markup, then you call this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1812">magic decorate method on it, then it swaps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1812">your DOM directly into the place it needs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">to be to render. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1820"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: That's right. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1823"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: This leaves it in the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">place as before so you can still interact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">with it like you did before. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1828"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: The cool thing here, exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1833">right, is that this is entirely render time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1833">so you don't have to touch the DOM, in fact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1844">the DOM stays exactly the same. What happens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1844">is this happens only at render time, so only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">when this stuff shows up on the page is things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">appear in the right spot. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1855"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Okay. So this is all very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1855">abstract. Let's go through a more concrete </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">example. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1862"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Sure. For example, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1864"><x-choice> element that we have just seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1864">in the markup example here is implemented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1869">using Shadow DOM, so you can see there it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1869">a very simple subtree. The Shadow DOM subtree </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1878">has a DIV in it and has a little mask which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1878">stands for the little icon there, but then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1885">you have this really interesting thing called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1885">content. Content is a name of the insertion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">point; it's the HTML element which represents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">the insertion point. And then you see it has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1905">a select attribute in a value that looks very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1905">similar to something. What does it look like? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1910">People from the audience? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1910">Is that &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1912"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: CSS? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1912"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Right, so that's what you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1915">use. You use CSS selectors to say which items </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1915">will show through in my insertion point? And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">so what we say here is the H3, first of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">type, which is the first H3 we find as child, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1932">is going to show up right here instead of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1932">this thing when rendering, and then we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">a little aside item for our tool tip, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">then we say, eh, everything else, universal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1941">selector goes inside there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1941"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So what we're doing basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">is we're using CSS to decide which elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">to sort of funnel and tele-port where when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1948">we render. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1948"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: That's right. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1950"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Okay. So what we're actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1950">kind of doing here too is we're almost defining </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1955">a declarative API. We say if you provide some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1955">H3s, the first ones, what we'll use as the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">actual name for the thing and later ones we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">just establish another &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1968"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: So you have this not only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">mechanism to stash things away into the subtree, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">you also have a mechanism to now declaratively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">project some of the items. You don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1975">to write a bit of script to do this. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1975">is all built in. This is standard stuff. Awesome? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1983">Awesome. All right. Okay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1983">And so the next thing is we need to take these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">Shadow DOM subtrees and build them into something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">useful, and that's where custom elements come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">in. Custom elements allow you to define a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">new element, and for that purpose we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">the new HTML element &mdash; that's a good name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">for it &mdash; which allows you to specify and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">say, well, there's my element, <x-choice>, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">and inside of it, the template. Remember the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2007">template? That's where my Shadow DOM subtree </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2007">instance is. Every time I create a new <x-choice>, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">that will be stamped out and create a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">instance of the Shadow DOM subtree. And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2013">you can run script inside of it to do lots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2013">of cool things. For example, you can declare </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2017">an imperative API, and say, well, the <x-choice> </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2017">method needs extra methods &mdash; or <x-choice> </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2021">object needs extra methods or properties on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2021">it, and you can do this. And also you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">define things like life cycle hooks, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">I want to run some scripts, register events </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2030">every time a new instance is created, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2030">That's useful stuff. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2034"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So that's how you define </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2034">it as a component author. For component users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2043">all you have to do, you include this link </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2043">to the components and point to the document </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2053">where this thing is defined, and then you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2053">can just use it like any other built-in tag </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">in your page. And also, so you talked about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">those imperative APIs we defined here, was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">selected on this thing. If I go through and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">grab this element out of the DOM using various </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">lectures, say, I can just call that method </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">directly on that object, the DOM object. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2094">DOM object is the object. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2094"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Right. And there's no faking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2097">there, right? There's no need to create separate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2097">objects or view or things, your DOM objects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">are the actual things that you operate on. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">When you query the standard DOM APIs, use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">them, whatever comes back to you is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">to be those things that you define. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2112"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: You don't have to know the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">convention of the framework, how we stash </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2117">things and how DOM are related. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2117"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: And also the link rail, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">the new rail components, gives you the opportunity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">to create the packaging mechanism to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">packaging right into the browser. You don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">have to have a build script that then compiles </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">all this thing into one gob of code. You don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">have to have five script tags loaded into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">your page. One link rail, you can load other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">link rails if you want, you will have more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2154">components that you want to reuse, and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2154">all it takes. So it's packaging. It's reuse. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">And also the ability to have one DOM hierarchy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">instead of multiple tree objects. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2170"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So one of the problems we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">have today on the Web platform is styles sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2178">of naturally go all over the place. And so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2178">when you're designing a style for your component, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2183">it might go and mess up somebody else inadvertently. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2183"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: That is a very common problem, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2189">especially if your object tree is pretty complex. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2189">At some point you really start losing sight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2195">of where &mdash; which selector, and you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2195">how many of you guys have committed the Cardinal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">sin of pound important? Okay. Be honest here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">now. And so in Shadow DOM, there is some really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">cool stuff here. In Shadow DOM the styles </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">are implicitly or explicitly scoped inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2218">of the Shadow DOM subtree. So even if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2218">put a universal selector inside of the Shadow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2227">DOM subtree, it will only apply instead of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2227">inside of the Shadow DOM subtree. So it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">not go and bleed out into a document. Similarly, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">styles that you apply in the document will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2238">not bleed into your Shadow DOM subtree. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2238">you have a very nice style separation boundary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">which really works extremely well for widget </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">case scenarios where you want to have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2246">boundaries defined and you don't want people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2246">to stomp on your styles, and you want to keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">some sort of sanity inside of your application. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2253"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Okay. So that is sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">behind the scenes. Thank you for that, Dimitri. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">I actually just got a call from a designer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2265">he's watching on the live stream, and he says </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2265">that we shouldn't have used accordion, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">should have used a tab strip in our demo. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2275"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: I actually agree with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">designer, accordions are kind of weird anyway, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">right, a cross between a piano and a harmonica, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2288">really? Oh, you're talking about a widget. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2288">I'm sorry. Okay, yes. So that is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">really easy, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">because we're using just markup, we're just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">swapping tags, so the idea of swapping out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">components now becomes just changing your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2301">markup, right? So now we have to just include </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2301">in your component and then change X accordion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2306">to be X tabs, and it's, you know, it's &mdash; we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2306">just see what happens, right? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2311"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Okay. So you say I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2311">to include the new component, which I actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">already did when you were talking, and I needed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">to change X-accordion to X-tabs, is that right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2320">Save that, switch back to the demo and just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2320">refresh. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2323"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: And now we have tabs. Applause, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323">please. [ APPLAUSE ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2326"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: No wing suit drop, no wing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2326">suits, but at least, you know, some cool tricks, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2331">right, at some point. All right. So this looks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2331">really, really awesome and I'm already kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2335">of enamored with this. I don't know about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2335">you guys. But I really want this poll on my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2344">website now. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2344"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: On your site. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2348"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: On my site. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2348"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: just so guys know, I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2356">show you what Dimitri's website looks like. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2356">It's beautiful. It's really special. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2360">awesome. So, no offense, Dimitri. I definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2360">hear that you want to have this poll on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">site. I'm a little bit concerned that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">might mark with it a bit, but that's okay. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2378">I'm going to package this up for you so that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2378">you can include it on your site without you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2383">worrying about how you're going to set this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2383">up. First of all, I don't want you to be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2389">to change the text for the choices, that way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2389">you could stack the deck. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2394"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: I could add my own choices, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2394">right? CSS 3. Why not CSS 4 or 7? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2398"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So what I'm going to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2398">actually is I'm going to create a new element </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2404">called awesome poll, obviously. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2404"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Has to be awesome, awesome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2407">site, right. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2407"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: And then to hide it from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2411">people who are vetting it, I'm going to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2411">and put in my Shadow DOM one of those polls </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2417">so you can't see it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2417"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2419"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Then what I'll do is I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2419">allow yourself to define sort of where this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">configuration is, and I'll then create all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">the stuff inside the X poll in my own little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2432">area. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2432"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Have you guys seen inception? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2436">And if you haven't, please leave the room </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2436">now. It's like we have to go one level deeper, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2438">right? Shadow DOM inside of the Shadow DOM. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2438">You know, seriously cool stuff. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2442"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Okay. So what we'll do, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2442">so then you can just put that right in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2444">page and you will have the poll right there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2444">Awesome. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2447"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Wow, this is &mdash; well... </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2447"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: What? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2450"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: It kind of looks not like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2450">my site actually. The place my vote clearly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2456">doesn't have enough exclamation points. I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2456">don't know. I kind of want to customize it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">a little. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2460"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Okay. Okay. So you're right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2461">This is actually technically just as good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2461">as an iframe basically. Doesn't give you any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2466">way to customize it. So you have such an interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2466">vocabulary and way of speaking. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2470"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: I do. I'm a very colorful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2470">person. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2473"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: I don't want you to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2473">control over everything, but I guess &mdash; I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2478">guess subtitle and the button will allow you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2478">to override. So I'm going to define in my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2483">poll, I'm going to allow you to have a declarative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2483">API, allow you to define your own aside for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2489">that subtitle and your own label text. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2489"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: That sounds good. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2493"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: What we'll do is we'll switch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2493">back to your site. Right here. I already wrote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2499">in here where you had this customization, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2499">save that, switch back to my demo, refresh, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2503">and vote for CSS 3 because it's awesome, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2503">vote now. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2506"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Now I have plenty of exclamation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2506">points, right, guys? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2509">Think about what just happened. Just stop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2509">for a second. I have customized a poll without </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2511">mucking it up, because Alex is a developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2511">of this custom component, of this web component, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2513">the awesome poll, only gave me the guardrails </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2513">to step into this specific areas, and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2516">all. And the way I do this is by markup. I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2516">don't have to go GS and do some weird muckety </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2524">muckety JSON stuff. Well, you know, the font </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2524">kind of looks like a clean and creepy. I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2532">something huggable and wonderful. What could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2532">be more wonderful than comic SANS? It's from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2538">the perfection, right? So what we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2538">to do &mdash; I want to say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2543">that I'm not going to do this unless you let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2543">me customize the font. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2548"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I admire design aesthetic, I think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2548">very unique, but I don't want you to be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2554">to run all over this stuff and break everything, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2554">so I guess what I'm going to allow you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2560">do is change a couple of things in here, before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2560">I do that, I'm want to walk you through how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2563">I'm going to do this. So CSS variables is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2563">one new technology, the spec is nearing completion. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2568">We actually have it implemented in Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2568">behind the flag. CSS variables &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2571"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Wait, wait, wait, did you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2571">just say CSS variables? Guys, are you getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2574">this? Are you getting the CSS variables? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2574"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Yeah, it's kind of cool, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2577">right, because today you have to have, define </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2577">pound FFF, one, two, three, four, like 8,000 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2580">places in you're CSS. This allows you basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2580">to define it once. So they're actually really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2585">really powerful. You can do all kinds of cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2585">stuff with cascade and referencing other variables. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2589">We don't need that today. I really encourage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2589">you guys to look more into CSS variables and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2593">all the crazy, amazing stuff it can do, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2593">the cool thing about CSS variables is it allows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2596">a very natural place for me to allow you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2596">override what I want. So when I'm writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2599">my poll, I'll use CSS variables very deliberately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2599">in places that I want you to be able to hook </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2602">in and change my stuff. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2602"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: So these are my styling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2606">hooks. I can't go anywhere and mess with anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2606">else. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2613"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: I'm only giving you &mdash; allowing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2613">you to change a few things. So in this case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2617">I'll allow you to change maybe the font and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2617">also the color that we use as the primary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2631">color. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2631"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Colors are important. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2632"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: What you'll do on your sheet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2632">is you'll just style &mdash; direct some styles, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2634">these variables at my poll, and then it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2634">magically just work. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2636"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: I want to see this. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2636"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: I'm going to switch to CSS, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2640">and I'm going to uncomment &mdash; I've already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2640">written &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2643"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: You made the right choice. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2643"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Comic sans, I thought you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2647">would like that. I'm going to switch back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2647">to my &mdash; to your site. Refresh. There you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2650">go &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2650"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: This is now awesome. I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2653">can do this. [ APPLAUSE ] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2653">But again take a second to think about this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2655">Now you as the developer of the widget or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2655">a component can give specific instructions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2657">to the browser on what to permit the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2657">of the component to do. Isn't that awesome? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2658">Isn't that styling APIs? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2658">Who wants this? Who wants this? [ Applause </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2658">] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2658"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: I want this. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2658"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: All right! </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2658"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Cool. So we've walked you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2659">through a couple of examples of how to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2659">this stuff and also some of the tactical uses </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2666">you can have with this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2666">And actually is a bigger deal than just that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2671">The way that I think of that actually &mdash; I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2671">actually a little bit dramatic, I guess sometimes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2677">is the declarative Renaissance. So way long </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2677">time go, you just used HTML, you just wrote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2690">(indiscernible) code straightforward, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2690">then we started using JavaScript a lot for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2704">a lot of stuff, right? But now this allows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2704">people to return back to writing things very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2709">declaratively in most cases. There's a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2709">of stuff that allows that to happen. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2711"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: And like one of the most important things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2711">that I think is &mdash; the ability to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2717">talk via an API. Or tell the browser, specify </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2717">to &mdash; to let the user know: These are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2722">things that you can do and no more. And no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2722">matter how much you hack about on this or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2726">do whatever this &mdash; whatever, you can't mess </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2726">up my stuff. My stuff is safe. I gave you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2727">these hooks, that's all that you can do. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2727">have CSS variables for the styling API and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2732">you have the components, the Shadow DOM technology, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2732">to allow you to have the markup API. And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2736">you, of course, can define &mdash; define the imperative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2736">API on custom elements. So the Web components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2740">give you those three things. To essentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2740">explicitly define APIs on the components now. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2741">Awesome stuff. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2741"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So another one that's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2741">cool is we talked about before, if DOM is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2741">your composition mechanism, then components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2741">from different libraries just work together. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2741">This is neat, I'm like oh, cool, you can get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2743">whatever widget you want. But it also means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2743">that today we have to spend all of this time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2746">recreating tabstrips and calendar controls </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2746">and everything in each and every framework. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2749">And, of course, each time you do it, you probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2749">aren't going to get 100% perfect, but 80% </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2753">of the way there. But if everyone can use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2753">any calendar component, then people will start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2755">using the better one, it will be more of an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2755">incentive to build really, really awesome, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2767">accessible, beautiful, interactive components. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2767">You will see a lot better components as well. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2774"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Right. No longer you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2774">to pledge allegiance to a specific framework. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2774">That little mini browser that was built inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2774">of your browser, you can say well, no longer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2775">I am just specifically a backbone man. I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2775">just use markup and mix them around, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2776">this is just markup. It's a common media. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2776">Just standard stuff is in the DOM, in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2778">browser. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2778">If you look at this, you can clearly see another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2778">advantage. For a &mdash; for a company or a team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2778">of people working on the same Web applications, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2779">ability to encapsulate offers tremendous advantages, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2779">right? Because now you can work on this stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2780">without worrying about stepping on each other's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2780">toes, you can have a clean separation, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2780">can build work flows that actually make sense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2780">and not have this crazy schemes of discipline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2780">built into this. Making that sure your selectors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2780">have to start with #foo and all of that thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2780">that you have to do today when you build complex </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2780">applications. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2780"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Cool. So the other case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2780">is that again most cases are fully declarative. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2781">So these people who don't know script, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2781">don't have a CS degree, they can still be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2781">really productive. They can build really cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2781">stuff with these components. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2782"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Right. And one of the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2782">things here is because the browser is taking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">care of loading and understanding the packaging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">obligations, the rendering of the things, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">it can go much faster because the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">ultimately kind of knows more about rendering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">than any author or any JavaScript engineer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">could do because we have a little more hooks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">than standard JavaScript application could. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2785"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: The final one, and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">one is kind of crazy, so bear with me, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">the rise of shared semantics. So today your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">semantics might only apply within your site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">because there's no good way to share them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2785">But if you allow people to define these tags </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">that are useful to Web developers, it's very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2786">obvious if we are &mdash; for example, we will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2786">see these x-polls, it's very obvious that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2791">people find that useful. And so this is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2791">great way for Web developers to experiment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2805">with new components and things. After a while, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2805">maybe you will see that everyone is using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2807">tabstrips, they are using it in the same basic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2807">way, well, we just roll that into the spec, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2809">roll that into the standard. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2809"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Directly into HTML. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2809"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Directly into the browser. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2809">Why do you have to define your own? This is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2810">a great place for Web developers to experiment, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2810">show us the way as browser developers, about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2811">what stuff we should be directly baking in. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2811"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Right. And if you look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2811">at it from another slightly different perspective, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2811">is that today there is no path from local </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2815">semantics, the semantics of your framework, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2815">to the global semantics, the public semantics </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2823">of HTML. Once you've built that thing imperatively, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2823">there is no existence of the actual tags, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2827">there is no path to the tags. You can just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2827">study those things, and look at the patterns </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2833">and wonder what is the right thing. But there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2833">is no path. With the custom tags, you actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2837">start having this path because these are just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2837">tags. And now all that you have to do is run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2840">a really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2840">really large query, which Google can do actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2841">and figure out which elements are common. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2841">Then you can know precisely which tags are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2842">winning, which tags deserve to become more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2842">public and at some point make it into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2843">&mdash; into the HTML spec, for example. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2843"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: It's really cool stuff. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2843">Again, Dimitri and I come from the future, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2843">so that's why we can talk about all of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2843">amazing stuff. The good news is actually that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2843">the future isn't quite as far away as you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2843">might think. We aren't from, like, years in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2843">the future; we're from, like, a few months </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">in the future, basically. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">So shadow DOM and CSS variables are both implemented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">in Chrome today. They are behind the 5. They </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">aren't released on the Web yet, but if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">really want to you can go on and play with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">them. There are lots of effective polyfills. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">Polyfills are basically shims that allow you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">to use functionality before it's directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">in the browser. We'll talk about those in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">a second. And another thing is this is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">a Chrome thing. This is being done in standards, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">we have a lot of other browser vendors are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">extremely excited about the number of folks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">from those are in the audience today. We are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">really working, this is a collaborative effort, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">a concerted effort with everybody to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">this. So this is something that you can actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">look forward to using relatively soon. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2844"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: It's happening, guys, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">coming, seriously. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2844"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So what can you guys do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">that you are all jazzed up about this stuff? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2845">Well, you can help the future arrive faster. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2845">The one way &mdash; there's lots of links and information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2845">on this slide. What you should do right now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2845">if you are already a member of the Web components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2846">plus page is follow us. We have a Google short </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2846">link right there for you. This is where we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2846">post interested updates about the spec, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2846">implementations, cool examples, blog posts. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2846">It's the one place that you can really learn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2846">about all of this stuff going on. And right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">after this we're going to post all of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">links to that plus page. If you want to, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">can read the introduction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">to Web components. You probably learn that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">specs are really hard to read and they often </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">are, but actually Dimitri has done an amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">job writing an explainer, that goes through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">all of these concepts, in quiet some depth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">but in a very readable way. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2847"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: I promise there's no comic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">sans on that page. If you are scared. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2847"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: You can also read the CSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">variable spec, understand more how that stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">works, all of the amazing stuff that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">do with it. It's really more powerful than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">it looks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2847"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: The other thing is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">there is actually a lot of really cool discussions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">happening right now in your present about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">the Web components and working out all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">the corner cases, working out the kinks of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">how things should work precisely. I mean we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">in the future, all of those things are solved, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">we don't have to worry about them, but you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">guys have to worry about it. Because getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">this stuff done just right and making sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">this does not suck is really, really important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2848">So, please, if you have any, you know, gumption </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">for bike shedding, or really, really endless </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">discussions with no end, please join the standards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">list and start listening in, start understanding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">what's going on, what's happening. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2848"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: It's also possible to start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">building with this stuff today. Dimitri has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">written a polyfill for Web components, all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">it requires is Shadow DOM, so you would have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">to turn it on in Chrome to play around with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">it. That's a really cool thing that actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2849">makes the polyfill for this entire thing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2849">everything that we have shown you today is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2849">how we actually did &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2849"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: You know those self driving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2850">cars? It's like that. It's like a very, very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2850">early prototype that you can possibly drive. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2850">Bad things may happen, I can't guarantee &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2850"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Don't use that one for anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2850">in production today are written by Daniel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2850">Buchner, who I believe is right there from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2851">Mozilla, he's built this really cool library </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2851">called x-tags. X-tags is basically a polyfill </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2851">for the custom elements part of what we showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2851">you today. The cool thing about that is this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2852">actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2852">works in all major browsers. It uses a number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2852">of very clever hacks to do it, but you actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2852">can start building real apps on top of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2853">today if you want. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2853"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Daniel is actually actively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2853">at work building a pretty, pretty solid toolkit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2853">on top of this, the UI widget library that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2853">would potentially power some really, really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2853">cool applications in the future. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2853"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: That's really cool, so check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2853">that out once we post the link to that plus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2854">page. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2854">All right, great! So that's all that we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2854">for you today, we wanted to share a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2854">bit more about Web components, it's a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2856">exciting thing for the future. Thanks so much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2856">for coming out. [ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2856"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: And &mdash; and in the future </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2856">&mdash; the future bus leaves in 10 minutes, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2857">until then we can answer your questions if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2857">you would like. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2857"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Come up to one of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2857">microphones that we've got here in the aisles. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2857"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: What about events? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2857"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: What about events is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2857">question we got from the audience. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2857"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: The events are actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">also handled by the Shadow DOM specifications, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">and there's really neat things that we do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">to make sure that the information in the event </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">never escapes outside of the Shadow DOM subtree, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">but the events are heard. It's called retargeting. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">What happens is that if something fires, like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">for example, if you click a play button in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">your video element, the event or the click </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">event propagates out, but it looks like it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">came from the video element. Does that make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">sense? So it's actually a really complex part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">of those things, and we fought extremely hard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">to make sure that Shadow DOM feels transparent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">to the user and it doesn't look like it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">affecting any actual normal operation of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">events. But the information from the inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">of the Shadow DOM subtree never leaks out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">on the outside. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: We've got a question at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">this mic. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So it sounds like a lot of this is helping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">you with bringing in dependencies and encapsulating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">code. Have you guys thought much in the spec </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">about dependency management, you know, I mean, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">obviously a lot of Java developers and a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">of developers in general use Maven for that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">so you don't get dependency explosion with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">inside your app. There's that encapsulated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">part but, you know, in a team you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">try and use consistent dependencies across. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">Has that been addressed in the spec at all? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: At this point there is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">just early discussions on how this actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">linking of the custom elements, the packaging, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">will happen, so this is actually a good time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">to start talking and start discussing this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">type of thing. I mean you saw that in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">future and you saw it works but, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">later on. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: What about like with media queries where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">the widget, the component need to adapt based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">on certain break points, and usually those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">break points are going to be different based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">on whatever context of the app they are used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">in. Right. So one of the interesting things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">there is that first of all we made sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">Shadow DOM actually operates within the confines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">of CSS, we are not inventing anything abnormal, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">so all of the CSS machinery the way that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">operate on it will just work. It just feels, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">it has the same &mdash; it will feel like it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">just part of the documents. So you will get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">all of the same information about the size </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">and media queries, things like that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">Audience member: (Inaudible). </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I'm an extension developer in the users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">group aficionado, and there's lots of templated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">sites out there that don't use that yet, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">that would be great to extend. And are you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">thinking about how to integrate this into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">the Chrome extension API so that we can add </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">components where there are none and change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">them? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Shadow DOM is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">one of the really, really use cases for extensions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">the ones that modify the page on the fly. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">Because what you can do is you can build a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">Shadow DOM into an element and the document </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">doesn't know that it's there. And so yes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">it's a very common use case, yes, it's coming. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I'm a (indiscernible) developer but I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">was thinking could you invent the map API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">into the Shadow DOM so it would build a custom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">tech for example a store locator and give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">that to a customer and say, hey, do this and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858"> &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: That's a phenomenal use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">case, doing exactly that. In fact, one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">the components of x-tag &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Talk to this guy, he's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">already got one. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: That's an awesome use case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">for it. Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Come on, bring it on! </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Anything else? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: What about the SCO, like there's potential </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">information like the SI tag that would be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">less important, would Google bot pick that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">up because it's not potentially rendered on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">the page? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: We don't work on the search team so we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">don't know the answer to that question. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">can imagine there's going to be interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">changes in the way that people &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: It doesn't have to be on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">the SI tag, it can be on H1 or poll, if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">want it to. It's up to you to define it as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">the author of the API. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: If there are any other questions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">Dimitri and I will be hanging around for few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">minutes afterwards if you want to ask us any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">other questions. Thanks so much. [ Applause </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Dimitri Glazkov</span>: Yay! </span></p></div>
