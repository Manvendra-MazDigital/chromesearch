<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="4"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Hi, everyone. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">Cool, the mic works. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="5">Good afternoon, everyone. Are you guys excited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="5">for the last session of the day? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">[ Cheering ]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="7"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: All right. My name is Akshay </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">Kannan, and I'm a PM on the project. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="12"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: And I'm Yuri Dolgov, and I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">software engineer on the project. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="15"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: And today we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="18">talking to you about Google Cloud Print and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="18">the future of printing. So real quick just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">to give you an outline of the presentation, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">we'll start with an introduction, explain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">what Google Cloud Print is. We'll talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">how you can integrate with our application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">both to print from as well as receive print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">jobs. We'll talk about some of the formats </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">we support and finally we'll talk about our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">future plans and where we're heading going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">forward. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="40">So real quick just to get a show of hands, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">how many of you guys in the audience have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">heard of Google Cloud Print prior to Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">I/O? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">Awesome. Pretty much everyone. Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="51">And how many of you guys have ever printed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">something using Google Cloud Print before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">coming here? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">Awesome. Most of you guys. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="59">And how many of you have ever used our API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">before? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">All right. A significantly smaller number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">of you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="67">So hopefully this talk will change that and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">will give you a better idea of our API as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">well as the platform as a whole. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="71">So let's quick things off. So at a very high </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">level, Google Cloud Print was a Web service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">that we at Google created to take the pain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">out of printing. We know that setting up a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">printer and printing to a printer are some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">of the most troublesome things that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">have to deal with everyday with computing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">and we really wanted to make that experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">better. So our high level goal with Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">Print was to provide a seamless, driverless </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">printing experience that worked regardless </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">of what platform you were on. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="98">Pretty much as long as your device can connect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">to the cloud you should be able to print without </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">running a full driver stack. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="109">So in terms of our motivations and what drove </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">this, I'm going to take a trip back in time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">to 2010, way back in the day when we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">designing Chrome OS and trying to find out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">how to solve printing on that platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="118">So printing is obviously really, really important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">use case on the Chromebook. It's a device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">that's designed for content creation, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">people need to print. And so we were considering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">different models for how to do this. On one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">hand you have your traditional driver model </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">which you're accustomed to on your Windows, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">Mac and Linux machine. This was great because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">it was tried and true, but there were a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">of trade-offs with this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="145">One major problem we saw is that we'd have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">to package every single Chrome OS device that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">we sold with a whole bunch of printer drivers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">that you may or may not even use. Especially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">for an action you perform not too frequently, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">it doesn't make sense to have this code sitting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">on every single device out there. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="162">I think another problem that we ran into with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">drivers is just the fact that we would have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">to keep them continuously updated. If you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">got a new printer and it didn't have the drivers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">that you needed on that device, you would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">be dependent on Google or on your printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">manufacturer to release drivers that were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">specific to your model, and that was just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">a huge pain point and we didn't want to deal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">with having this constant baggage on every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">Chromebook that we'd have to keep updated. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="182">I think third of all, and most importantly, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">Google has a lot of platforms that are important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">on the cloud. We have Chrome, we have Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">OS, we have Android. And we didn't want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">just come up with a solution for one platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="196">We wanted to come up with a solution that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">would scale to a whole bunch of platforms. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="199">And that was the beauty with Cloud Print is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">because what we had was a Web service, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">were able to build something server side which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">supported all the different platforms that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">Google has. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="207">And this is a comic I like. It's an excerpt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">from The Oatmeal, which sort of gives you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">an idea of some of the pain points you run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">into with traditional driver installations, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">and this is exactly what we want to avoid </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">with Google Cloud Print. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="221">So this cool 3D diagram gives you sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">a high level overview of how our system works </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">and what exactly it does. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="231">There are a variety of devices you can print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">from. Some examples just given here are your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">tablet, your Chromebook, your Android phone, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">your iPhone, your &mdash; or even your traditional </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">Mac or PC. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="241">Your print jobs are sent to Google Cloud Print. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="246">You can and them over any format and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">we convert them into the format they need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">to be in for the destination printer. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="250">So here are three examples of devices we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">send print jobs to. Arrow A is pointing to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">a printer that is shared through Google Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">Print through an intermediary laptop acting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">as a connector. We'll explain more of that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">later. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="266">Arrow B is pointing to a cloud-ready printer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="268">These are printers that talk directly to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">Google Cloud Print service from within their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">firmware. We have one of these printers up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">front and will actually be doing some live </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">printing for you later. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="276">And then Arrow C, which is basically you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">printing to an enterprise server, which could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">be managing thousands of printers. And we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">actually use a server very much like this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">inside of Google to manage all of our printers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">with employees. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="289">So the great thing with Google Cloud Print, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">and one of the reasons that &mdash; I guess the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">beauty of the platform and why we find it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">so powerful is it allows you to do all kinds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">of things that you could never really imagine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="304">doing before with local printing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="304">So for one thing as an application developer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">to add printing functionality with your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">is as easy as three lines of code. Yuri is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">going to be guiding you through that at a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">later portion of the presentation. But we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">really made it really, really easy for you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">as developers to plug into the platform and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">integrate with Google Cloud Print. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="323">Another advantage you have is because with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">Cloud Print all your print jobs go through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">the cloud, you can print not just to printers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">but actually to any device or application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">which is connected to the cloud. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="336">And we've built a lot of really interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">products around this, which we'll be explaining </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">more later in the presentation as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="340">Finally &mdash; and this feature is something we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">feel that is really powerful is that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">made it dirt simple to share printers with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">people. I don't know how many of you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">have ever tried to share a local printer with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">someone, but it's not exactly a really fun </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">process. You can either do it through network </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">sharing and set up your computer as a server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">or you can pass someone a USB cable in which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">case they have to plug it in, go through a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">bunch of driver installs and by the time they'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">get printing it will take forever. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="369">So we've made sharing ridiculously easy, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">I'm actually going to show you a demo of that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">real quick. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="378">So the great thing with Cloud Print is we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">made sharing a printer as easy as sharing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">a doc. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="382">So here you can see the Cloud Print management </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">page in Google Chrome. This is just google.com/cloudprint. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="385">You can see I have three printers. The printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">that I have selected is actually the printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">in the front of the room. This is our demo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">printer. And if I want to share this printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">with Yuri, all I have to do is click the green </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">share button and you see a sharing dialogue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">just like the one in Docs. I type in Yuri's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">Gmail account, I hit enter and I hit share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">and that's it. I've just shared this printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">with Yuri and it was as easy as sharing a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">doc with him. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="417">So because your printers are associated with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">your Google account it allows us to make sharing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">really simple and seamless. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="422">And I guess as a fourth point also with Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">Cloud Print, because all your print jobs go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">through the cloud, we're completely OS, device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">and browser agnostic, so your printing experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">is going to be virtually identical whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">you're on your Android phone or whether you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">on your Windows PC. You're gonna see the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">print options, see more or less the same dialogue, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">and we've done this to provide a consistent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">experience regardless of what platform you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="452">So I've given you a high level overview of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">the platform and now I'm going to hand it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">out to Yuri and he will explain how to integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">with Cloud Print from within your apps. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="459"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: Hey, guys. I'm going to guide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">you through engineering part of our presentation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="465">And I want to start with the limitations of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">existing printing solutions on different platforms. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="471">With Web platform nowadays you can pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="471">much build whatever application you can think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">of, but when it comes to something as printing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">and still there are many people who care about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">getting their document printed, you are faced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">with a whole bunch of different problems. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="487">Pages look different on different Web browsers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">so you have to worry about making them look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">the same on every single browser you basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">create your application for. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="496">If you have mobile version of your Web application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">it's even worse because usually the mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">version is different from desktop and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">might want to have printed version looks the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="505">same as on desktop. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="505">With mobile devices it's even worse. For every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">single new platform you put your variation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">to, you have to come up with different printing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">solution. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="515">And for some platforms you don't even have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">standard solutions, you have to invent them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">on your own, and that's what we are trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">to solve with Cloud Print. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="523">With Cloud Print we want to provide you with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">the same seamless printing experience on every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">single platform. Same API, same content type </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">of the documents, everything is the same on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">every single platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="543">I want to start to use example of Web integration, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="543">how you integrate Cloud Print in your existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">Web application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="551">For Web we have very simple, yet very powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">way. It's gadget based. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="555">So basically first thing you need to do is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">just load gadget code from this URL on to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">your page. And gadget cross-name is called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">print gadget. It has only one static method, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">which is create default print button, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">creates default button, which looks like this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="574">And if you create instance of this gadget </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">you can also use those methods listed before. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="581">First of them is set on close callback, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">is pretty trivial, allows you to set on close </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">callback. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="590">You can set any function that is going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">be called when print dialogue is closed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="595">The next one is set print button. There it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="599">And that one allows you to set whatever HTML </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">element you want to attach to bring the gadget </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="604">You can use either button generated by this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">method or you can use your own DOM, it doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">matter. Whenever a user clicks on the DOM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">element, a print dialogue is going to pop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">out. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="618">Next &mdash; and the main method of this gadget </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">is set print document, which allows you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">set documents that is going to be printed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="623">First parameter of that is content type, content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">type of document you want to print. Second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">one is title of the print job. Third one is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">going to be used to identify the job by the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">user in print queue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="642">Third one, and the main, is content of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="642">document. And content can be both binary or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">Base64 encoded. Though Base64 encoded version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">is a little bit larger than binary version, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">you might still want to prefer that in some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">cases, especially if you have some kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">Native-to-JavaScript breach, and in this case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">you might face jobs of early string terminations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="665">or stuff like that. So you might sacrifice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="665">a slice and still use Base64 encoded version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="672">of the document. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="672">And if you decide to use Base64 encoded version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">of the document you will need to set force </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">parameter, which is optional content in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">colon. And in this case you will need to parse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">Base64 string. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="686">If you want to have more control on opening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">and closing print dialogue, you might want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">to use two other &mdash; two methods below. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">open print dialogue and close print dialogue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">which allows you to open and close print dialogue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="696">And you might want to use it if you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">open print dialogue on some custom action </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">like print &mdash; document was uploaded or &mdash; and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="708">conversion was done or registration finished, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="708">stuff like that, so any custom events. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="715">I want to go and show you how you do it in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">an existing application. This is just fragment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">of code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="724">Let's say (indiscernible). It goes like here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="730">So the first thing you need to do is load </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">gadget code, as I said. The next thing, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">this example we use on print function, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">is going to be called whenever a user wants </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">to print a document. The third thing we do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">in this function is create a Cloud Print gadget </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">instance. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="744">The next thing we set print document you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">to print. In this case we use the application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">PDF content type, but we can use many others </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">and we will tell you more about that later. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="752">And we said print job title, like my print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">job title, something. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="759">And this is Base64 encoded content of PDF. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="764">And since this is Base64 encoded, we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">to set force parameter to Base64. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="769">And then we just open print dialogue, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">that's it, we are done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="776">And one more thing I want to mention is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">this code you'll work exactly the same way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">on any browser, including mobile browsers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="782">So you only implement it once and &mdash; well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="788">we'll do everything for you. We'll open different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="788">type of dialogues on different browsers, depending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="794">on &mdash; well, optimize them for those. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="794">Yeah. And we want to show you how Box integrated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">with us. They basically took almost no time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">to do that. I hope you know what Box is, all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">right? It's file sharing, file storing service. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="813">I have my Box account opened here and I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="824">only one document and I want to print it with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="824">Cloud Print. So I see it send to Google Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">Print and here I see print dialogue. As you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">can see I have invitation to accept a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">printer. The printer is actually shared with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">me a few minutes ago. I will go ahead and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">accept this printer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="842">There we go, printer is accepted, and now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">we're going to use it to print this document. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="848">You see the document was immediately sent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">to the printer and it's going to be printed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">like in a few seconds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="863">So it's super easy to integrate Web application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">on Cloud Print and it's even easier to integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">Android application with Cloud Print. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="870">In order to do that you will need to include </span><span class="line" data-startTime="875">Cloud Print intent code into your application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="875">and you can get this code on this URL &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">[ Applause ]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="884"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Sorry to interrupt. To make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">matters even more interesting, this printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">is connected using a mobile network, so &mdash; yeah, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">everything seems to be connected. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">[Laughter]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="897"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: Okay. I will continue this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">Android integration. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="902">On Android, the integration is even simpler </span><span class="line" data-startTime="902">than on the Web. All we need to do is just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">add Cloud Print intent into your application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">and you can get a code of this intent on this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">URL. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="913">And the intent class name is cloud print dialogue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="918">And all we need to do is just illustrate this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="918">intent, subdate it and type up the documents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">you want to print, set titles of the document </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">you want to print and start the intent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="930">Since it's so that simple I want to go ahead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">and show you how to do it in a real application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="935">In my case application is not that real. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">is Danny Web browser. Thank you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="942">So it's Danny Web browser, and there is only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">three URL elements, URL box, which is basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">a box where you can type URL you want to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">to. Go button, which you need to click in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">order to go to this URL. And Web view, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">is &mdash; well, which contains content of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">Web page. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="960">So you will see codes there. It's very simple. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="965">I don't want to spend too much time on that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="965">The only non-trivial part here is that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="972">have functionality to get HTML content on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="972">the Web page, and in order to do that we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">to have JavaScript-to-Java bridge because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">&mdash; well, this is the only way you can access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="981">Web view content. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="981">Anyways, I'm going to compile and start this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="987">There we go. So this is, as I said, very simple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">browser. You can open the page, you can navigate, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">do stuff like that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1003">Let's go ahead and integrate this Cloud Print. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1003">What we need to do is just add the URL element. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1009">You can click in order to open print dialogue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1009">In this case it's a button and I have it already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1020">in my layout XML file, so I don't want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1020">spend time implementing, write it once again. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1028">And they have (indiscernible) already. I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">go ahead and explain line by line what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1035">have here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1035">First thing we do is create print intent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1038">Then we find print button in the UI and set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1038">on click listener. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1046">So in on click listener what we do is just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">get content of the Web page, set it as document </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1052">to be printed, along with content type, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1052">in this case that's HTML, set title of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">print job and start the activity. That's pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">much it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1063">Let's look how it works. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1063">So it should start in a second. Here we go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1077">The connection is a bit slow. Here you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">a new button print. We'll go ahead and click </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">this button. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1091">This will open print dialogue and you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1098">select printer you want to print to. Let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1098">use the same printer again. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1105">Print. And it should be instantly sent to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">printer. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1109">No? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1109"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: There we go. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1112"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: Okay. Worked this time again. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1112">Okay. It's going to be printed in a few seconds, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">so I'm going to continue with &mdash; yeah, with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">my presentation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1127">In some cases those two integrations might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">not &mdash; oh, by the way, yeah, you can get the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">code of this presentation from here. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">completely open. You can check how it looks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">in details. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1141">So in some cases those two integrations might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1146">not be enough for you. For example, you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1146">working with some other platform or you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">to have some more flexibility, doesn't matter. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1149">We still have open APIs that you can use. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1155">And there are three main API codes that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">need to know if you want to send a job to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">Cloud Print. First one is search. It allows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">you to search for all the printers available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1164">for the user. You can do some filter and some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1164">searches, like some filter &mdash; like filter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">in by (indiscernible) or by status for those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">printers, but after all the goal is to provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">user a list of printers available for them. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">Once user selects the printer they want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">print to, you need to do another code, printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">code, which will return capabilities of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">printer. And you will need to show those capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">to the users so that they could select how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">they want to print the job. Once capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">are selected, you would need to do the third </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1196">one, third call, which is the certainly the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1196">main one. That will submit a print job to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1202">printer, printer is given printer ID, title </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1202">of the job, capabilities, content type, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1214">&mdash; if content of the job is Base 64 encoder, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1214">so you will need to set up a content task </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1218">for encoding as well and content itself. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1218">it's super easy again and with that I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1225">to hand it back to Akshay. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1225"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Sounds good. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1229">So we have showed how you can integrate with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1229">that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1232"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1235"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So we have showed you how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">we can integrate with Cloud Print, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">use our Web widget, Android widget, or HTTP </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">API directly, we have really tried to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1247">it easy to bring that functionality into your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1247">app. That's printing from a lot of places, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">but we actually also support printing to a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">lot of places, printing to anywhere. We have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">over 20 million printers that are registered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">with Google Cloud Print as of today and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">number is continuing to grow, so our main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">type of printers are &mdash; at least for the best </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1270">user experience, we recommend what we call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1270">cloud ready printers. These are printers that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1275">connect directly to the Web from within the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1275">firmware themselves. We have over 70 cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1281">ready printer models that are available from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1281">a wide variety of retailers and manufacturers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">and we've &mdash; in particular printers the list </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">that we have here on our slide deck of HP, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1291">Canon, Kodak, Epson, Fuji Xerox and Samsung, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1291">are just the manufacturers who have printers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1297">that are currently available. We are working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1297">with a much larger list of manufacturers over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1302">time to expand this out. So basically it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1302">be hard at some point to buy a printer that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1307">not cloud ready. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1307">We also have a full list of printers on our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1311">Web site, g.co/cloudprint where you can check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1311">out what printers are available. And which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1318">ones are cloud ready. I know a lot of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1318">also probably don't want to buy a new printer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1323">You just use Google Cloud Print, and the good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1323">news is that you don't have to. We support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">what's called the Chrome connector, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">allows you to take any local printer that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">connected to your printer running Chrome and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">use that printer as a print server. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1336">So how this works it's let's say that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">have Google Chrome running on your Windows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1340">PC at home. You can USB your printer into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1340">there, set it up as a local printer. And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">from within Chrome settings, you can register </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">&mdash; in fact here's a screen shot from the settings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1349">dialogue, you just click the add printers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1349">button right there, and it's simply a one-click </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1353">process. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1353">Your local printers will automatically get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">added to your Google Cloud Print account with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">the account that you are logged in with. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1360">we do make it easy to set up printers that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1360">are not cloud ready. The only caveat here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1365">is that you do need to keep your computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1365">running in order for jobs to be printed out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1369">That being said, if you submit a print job </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1369">to a computer that's turned off, it gets queued, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1374">so next time you turn it on your job will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1374">get released and printed out from the printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1378">that's connected to it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1378">Also we don't just support printer to printers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1382">as I mentioned earlier. But we really support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1382">printing to anywhere. You can print to &mdash; currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">every Google Cloud Print dialogue has the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">option save to Google drive, which will take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1391">whatever you are printing, convert it to a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1391">PDF, and save it in your Google drive account </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1395">or you can even print to a FedEx office, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1395">is a partnership we recently launched this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1399">year which allows you to print your document </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1399">and get a retrieval code, which you can use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1404">to basically print out and pay for your job </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1404">at any local Fed-Ex office location within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1409">the U.S. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1409">Finally, another little exciting feature that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">we have is the ability to print to your mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">phone. So if you have Chrome for mobile installed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1418">on Android or iOS and you are signed into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1418">sync, what we do is we actually register your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">phone as a Google Cloud Print device in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">dialogue. So what you will be able to do &mdash; whenever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">you are printing from Cloud Print, if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">are using the same account that you have set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">up your phone with, you will see your phone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">as a destination that you can print to. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">what we do is we just push an Android push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">notification that the job is available and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1440">it gets downloaded to your phone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1440">So this is already available today and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1445">guys can try it out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1445">Finally, in terms of printing to anywhere, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1451">we also &mdash; like most of our product &mdash; have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1451">a fully open API that you can use as developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1456">to receive print jobs. So we have an XMPP </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1456">interface, which you can connect to in order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1461">to receive print job notifications. And we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1461">also have a full set of HTTPS interfaces that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">you can connect to to basically fetch the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">job, set job status. And I'll delve into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1472">details in the next slide. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1472">Cloud ready printers such as the one you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">see on stage have already implemented this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">in firmware. So it's real easy to implement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">whether you are working with low-level hardware </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">or building an application. Yeah, really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1485">any application or device can implement this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1485">And so we leave the possibilities of integration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1492">up to the developer. And a lot of this really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1492">allows you to use your imagination for what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">you can print to. Some examples we just thought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">of are you could print to your Kindle. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">could build an application that would allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">you to print documents for reading on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1504">go. You could technically build an application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1504">that would even allow you to print to a smart </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1509">Web connected TV. And if monkeys were cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1509">connected, then you could even print to a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1516">monkey with a typewriter. That one might require </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1516">more imagination than the others. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1522">So just to go into the details of our API, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">there's two API calls you really call about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1527">with our job retrieval. There's our fetch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1527">API, which takes in a printer ID as an argument, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">so you would call to fetch API when you receive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">an XMPP ping that a job is available. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1538">what the fetch API does is it returns a JSON </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1538">list of the jobs that are available to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">printed. In this JSON object for each job, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">we have two parameters that are important, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1550">the fie URL parameter and the ticketURL parameter. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1550">The fileURL parameter, which is the one right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1554">here, is basically a URL that you can use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1554">to download the file. So the cool thing about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1561">this URL is that &mdash; you can &mdash; you can dynamically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1561">change the format of the file by specifying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1566">a different accept header when you are fetching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1566">this URL. So for example, if you want to fetch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1571">the job as a PDF, you set your accept header </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1571">to be application PDF, then we will convert </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">the document to a PDF server site and send </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">it to your printer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1579">If you want to fetch it &mdash; the other main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">format is PWG Raster, which is a simple Raster </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">based image format. If you want to fetch that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">you just set your accept header to PWG Raster </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">and we will stream the file to you in that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">format. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1594">And then finally ticketURL is basically your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">print ticket that contains a list of the filled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">options of exactly what the user specified. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1600">For example, portrait or landscape or whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">other capabilities you have exposed from your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">printer that are configurable. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1612">Our second API, which is important is our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1612">control API, which allows you to basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">update the status of the job as you're printing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">it. So by default, whenever you print a job, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1621">we set the status of that job to be queued. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1621">And over time as you are printing that &mdash; so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1625">for example, when you start to fetch, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1625">can set the job, move the status from queued </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1629">to be in progress, and then when you are done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1629">printing the job, you can move the status </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">to done. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">If something goes wrong, you can also set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1635">the status to error, and specify an error </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1635">of coded message string. Finally we do take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">security and privacy really seriously with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">Google Cloud Print and one example of how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1648">we do this is we have a secure data access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1648">model, such that every item within our system, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">whether it's a printer, whether it's a print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">job is (indiscernible), so that you can only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">print to that if you have explicit permissions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">as your account to send a print job there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1663">So all of the APIs that we mentioned earlier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">are authenticated so you have to be logged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1667">in as a user who has explicit privileges to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1667">access that. So we earlier said that you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1672">print to anything, but that was a lie because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1672">we have security restrictions in place. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1676">Finally, we also support so &mdash; so this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1676">actually I'll start with the problem here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1682">is when you are dealing with printer registrations, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1682">registration is an API that's difficult to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">make an authenticated call because it requires </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">the printer to somehow authenticate as you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">before it can register itself with the system. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">That's a hard problem, because &mdash; the biggest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">concern for is it's a security issue because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">you could have printers when you are typing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1704">credentials into the printer that could store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1704">them locally unencrypted on the device, make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">it vulnerable to attackers who could steal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">your Google account from the printer. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1713">then also I think on another folder also the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1713">UI problem of not all printers &mdash; not all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">printers support text entry on their device. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1717">So we've solved this using what we call the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">anonymous registration flow. This allows the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">printer to basically make an unauthenticated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">registration call to our servers, which anonymously </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">registers the printer to Google Cloud Print. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1731">In order to actually complete the registration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1731">process, we have returned a URL to the printer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">which the printer can then print out and give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">to the user and the user can visit that URL </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">on their Web browser and complete the registration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">process from there. We know that this is secure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1744">because you are only entering your credentials </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1744">into a Google log-in page and not into a third </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1750">party interface. And then finally there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1750">also robot accounts, which are special accounts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">that we create just for printers in our system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">when the registration happens. The nice thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">with robot accounts is that they are sandboxed, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">so they are only given restricted access to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1765">Google Cloud Print and can't access other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1765">things in your Google account that you wouldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">want them to. Finally, all of our interfaces </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">use HTTPS and we strongly encourage you as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1775">developers to also use the HTTPS versions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1775">of our API. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">Finally, regarding privacy, another problem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">that we've dealt with is spam invitations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1786">So, for example, if I shared &mdash; I could technically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1786">share 100 printers with Yuri and completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">spam his account. Another possible attack </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">is that I could share a printer, which looks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1797">like one of Yuri's printers to him, and he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1797">could end up printing to that and I could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">steal all of his data as a result. So one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">thing to prevent this is we have implemented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">printer sharing invitations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1804">So this, as you saw earlier, requires Yuri </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">to explicitly accept my printer sharing invitation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">before he can print to a printer. As part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1814">of that invite process, he sees exactly who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1814">I am and the name of the printer that I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1817">sharing with him, so this prevents you from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1817">getting spammed with printers and also prevents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">you from printing to printers unless you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">absolutely sure that you have accepted an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1826">invitation and that you know who sent you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1826">that invite. And then finally regarding print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1832">job content retention, we delete for jobs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1832">as soon as the status is set to done. If the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">status is never set to done, then after 30 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">days, we delete print job content from our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">servers. We don't store them long term. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">Finally, we've talked about how you can print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1848">from anywhere, how you can print to pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1848">much anywhere, and I'm going to go into another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1853">part of our presentation which is how you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1853">can print anything. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1856">We do support a very, you know, Google Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1856">Print was developed with sort of developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">in mind. And client platforms in mind. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">we realized that when you are generating documents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">client side, you don't want to be bound to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">a particular format that you have to generate. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1870">You want to have the flexibility to generate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">your content in whatever formant you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">and then send it server side where we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">do the necessary conversion. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1877">So for this reason, our API accepts virtually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1877">any format as input for your print job. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">you can send us pdfs, stand image formats, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">most standard document formats, Google docs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1888">Microsoft Office documents, HTML documents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1888">or even URLs which we can fetch server side </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">and NET Frame. On our side, we make our best </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">effort to convert this document into either </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1900">PDF or PWG Raster. Another thing that's interesting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1900">if you don't care about conversion, then our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1908">platform &mdash; if the input and output formats </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1908">are identical, we will actually do no conversion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1912">whatsoever and simply pass the file through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1912">our system. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">This could be really useful if you wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">to do something like make a 3D Cloud Printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">that used a special format, as long as the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">format that you in which you are submitting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1922">the job and receiving the job in are the same, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1922">our system will just pass the job content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1926">right through. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1926">It's also particularly useful for sending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1929">&mdash; if you want to encrypt content and before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1929">you send it to us, decrypt it after you receive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1933">it, you could send us a custom encrypted format, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1933">which we would pass directly through without </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1938">doing any conversion on whatsoever. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1938">Then, finally, one format that I wanted to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1945">focus on that I think is particularly powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1945">is HTML. It's a format that's easy to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1950">client side and sent to us on the server side. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1950">The other great thing about HTML is there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">no direct page content that's here or I guess </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">page layout information. So it allows us server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">side to intelligently flow the HTML, depending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">on what media size of paper that you are printing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">to. So, for example, if you are in the U.S. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1968">and you are printing to an 8 and a half by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1971">11 page, we will flow the HTML text and images </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1971">for an 8 and a half by 11 paper and generate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">the appropriate PDF server side. If you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">in some other and country and using A4, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1982">we would flow the HTML content for an A4 and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1982">send that to you, so as an application you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">wouldn't even have to worry about the media </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">size of the destination printer that you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1991">sending content to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1991">So I'm now going to just spend a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">of time talking about our future work and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">where we're heading going forward with Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">Cloud Print. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">So &mdash; so one huge challenge for us has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2006">handling printer capabilities. There's &mdash; they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2006">can be kind of a nightmare to deal with. There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">a lot &mdash; basically with printer capabilities, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">the two main formats are XPS and PPD. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">the thing that makes them interesting as well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">there are standards. Printer manufacturers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2023">only have to write capabilities such that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2023">they'll work with their particular driver. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2027">So for this reason, there can be a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2027">ways to specify the same option. Even an option </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">as simple as portrait or landscape specified </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">differently on different platforms. So we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2038">really &mdash; what we want to do is rather than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2038">just reading strings, we want to be a able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">to intelligently understand these capabilities, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">make sense of them, produce good options UI </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2046">around them, and also even surface some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2046">this functionality to developers. So that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2052">as an application developer, you can know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2052">about the printer that you are sending jobs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">to at a high level without having to parse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">these capabilities yourself. So that's one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2060">of our big goals going forward is to more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2060">intelligently understand these different capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">and be able to semantically parse them on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">our side. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">Real quick here, you can see our server's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">JSON representation or an excerpt from our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">server's JSON representation of an XPS capability, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">we will see an idea of what that's like. Another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2083">big goal that we're working towards are making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2083">public and commercial printers that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2088">print to ubiquitous. We really like the concept </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2088">of being able to print even without owning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">a printer, no matter where you are. We did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">launch a partnership with the Fed-Ex office, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2100">as I mentioned earlier, which makes this possible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2100">Another thing, if you guys are on the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2105">floor of Moscone, we do have a Cloud Print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2105">station, which we have set up, to allow you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2109">to print to public printers. You can print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2109">to these printers simply by tapping an NFC </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2114">tag or scanning a QR code, it gives you &mdash; instantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2114">adds the printer to your Google account and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2120">allows you to start sending print jobs to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2120">it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">And then, finally, one of our biggest and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">most exciting goals and moving forward is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2129">we want Cloud Print to be tightly integrated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2129">with other Google properties. So you can come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">to expect the same consistent printing experience, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">regardless of what Google platform you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">using. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2140">One feature that I'm about to give you a sneak </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2142">preview of is some of the work that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2142">been doing in Google Chrome to tightly integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">Cloud Print with the local printing experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">in Chrome and just make that seamless. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">real quick, I'm going to grab the laptop and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">open up the &mdash; this is the Canary channel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">of Chrome, it's updated nightly. This is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">pretty risky demonstration. So what we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">going to do is we're going to try printing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">our own API documentation using the new Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">Print dialogue that we're working on. So I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">just going to hit command P. It's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2174">open the dialogue that you all know and love, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2174">except there's a slight difference. And that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2179">is &mdash; I don't know if you guys can notice, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2179">the destination pane is slightly different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2183">from what you are used to. And by the way, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2183">this is all available on dev channel today, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2187">so you guys can check this out for yourselves. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2187">So what's going to happen here is I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">to click change, this pops up something different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">from the usual drop-down. It actually pops </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2197">down a screen where your local printers and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2197">your Cloud Printers are integrated side by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2202">side. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2202">What's happened is because I'm signed into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2204">Chrome as cloudprint.user@gmail.com, I'm able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2204">to see my Google Cloud Print printers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2210">You with see from within the Chrome dialogue, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2210">I can see save to Google drive, I can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2214">print to Fed-Ex office and I can see the printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2214">that's been shared with me, which is the Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2218">Print demo printer. This guy up front. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2218">what I'm going to do is for the sake of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2222">demo, I'm going to choose the Cloud Print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2222">demo printer. I'm going to hit print. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2226">what happens is this document is posted to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2226">the Cloud Print service and then sent to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">printer, which should be printing it out any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">second. So this is our integration in Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2235">and it's &mdash; you know, we've tried to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2235">it as seamless as possible, basically as easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2240">to print to Cloud Print as it is to print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2240">to a local printer. And this is just one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">the many integrations that you will see across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">Google properties going forward, so we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2248">really excited for that. So actually, once </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2248">this prints out, that concludes the end of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2254">our presentation. Thank you so much for coming. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2254">We're going to leave the remaining 20 minutes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2260">for Q and A. So &mdash; so &mdash; so fire away. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2260">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2268"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: All right. We will start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2268">the right side of the room. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2277"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi. I had one question. On the Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2277">apps and on the Web. Is there a way to &mdash; to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2285">take away some of the options in the printing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2285">especially the number of copies that are printed? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">My app requires that the user be able to print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">something only once. So is there a way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">suppress the number of copies that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">print? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2296"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So the question was whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2296">it's possible to restrict certain options </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2301">within the Android dialogue and within other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2301">dialogues to not show options such as copies. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">Actually &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2308"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: No, there is not such a way. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2313">But, yeah, this is nice suggestion. We'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2313">&mdash; we'll discuss it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2317"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Is there a way to actually suppress it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2317">using the HTTPS protocols? I mean, I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323"> &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2323"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: If you create your own, your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2325">custom print dialogue, you can suppress whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2325">you want. But in this case, you have to parse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2330">capabilities yourself. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2330"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yeah, that's fine. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2332"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So you can do it using the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2332">HTTPS API and basically not show certain options </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">in your UI. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2337"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2342"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: You mentioned that you have millions of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2342">Cloud Print printers on your system now. Can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2346">you speak a little bit about the infrastructure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2346">required for that? Do you have millions of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">TCP connections that are open, using UDP or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">how does that work? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2355"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: For our cloud ready printers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2355">we are using XMPP to handle the notifications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2361">between us and those printers. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2361">There isn't necessarily a one-to-one correspondence </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">of XMPP connections to printers. Because a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">lot of times with the Chrome connector, with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">Cloud Print servers, you have multiple printers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">which can be associated with a single connection. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2374">So &mdash; so what it is, for cloud ready printers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2374">we have one XMPP connection for each of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2380">printers. And for printers that are connected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2380">to the server or a different Chrome connector, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2384">it's an XMPP connection per machine. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2384">So &mdash; so, for example, if I'm sharing five </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2390">printers with my MacBook, I'd have five XMPP </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2390">open or, I'm sorry, one XMPP connection controlling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2395">all five of those printers. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2395"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: But just short questions &mdash; the short </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2400">answer to your question is we keep millions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2400">connected, connections open on our site, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2405">every single printer, and we rely on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2405">infrastructure for that. So, yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2413"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So if my office just lost its internet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2413">connection because a cable chewed on the wire, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2418">all I can do is stare at my Cloud Printers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2418">correct. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2422"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: What happens is when your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2422">printers are offline, any job goes into a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">queued state, so everyone would still be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">to print, but then once the internet comes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2431">back on, all the jobs would come back out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2431">of the printer. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2434"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I cannot send jobs directly to the print, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2434">they have to go through Google. No connection </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2440">to Google, no printing. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2440"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2444"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Got it. Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2444"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Is there a Linux print server for this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2450">or windows print server, short of leaving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2450">Chrome open on the server? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2453"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: There is, actually, so on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2453">Linux, how it works is you can start the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">connector, but actually you can run Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">in &mdash; this is actually &mdash; it's in the chromium </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2465">source. I'm not sure how much of this is documented. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2465">We'll probably be documenting over time. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2471">you can run Chrome in a headless mode with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2471">a certain command line flag, which will start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2476">the Cloud Print service up in the background, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2476">and it's what we do internally at Google to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2480">get all of our thousands of printers online. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2480">So it doesn't require you to keep Chrome running; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2484">it just requires you to have Chrome installed, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2484">and you launch it with the flag which starts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2488">up the Cloud Print service in the background. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2488"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I've noticed that sometimes the office </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2495">printer that I Cloud Print to doesn't appear </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2495">in the dialogue box. I assume that's because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2502">it's kind of a flakey printer and sometimes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2502">it's offline or broken or something, but I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2505">didn't see in your API that there was a way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2505">for a printer to report its status, or how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2512">does that &mdash; how does Google know that that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2512">printer is not available? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2516"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So what we do is for status, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2516">we actually determine that using your XMPP </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2521">status. So if the printer doesn't have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2521">active connection, in fact you could see this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2526">if I turn the printer off right now, it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2526">show up as offline in the dialogue. We basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2531">use the XMPP status of the printer to determine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2531">whether it's online or offline. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2534"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So that doesn't remove from the list, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2534">though? Is there some &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2537"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: It doesn't remove from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2537">list. What it does is it grays it out and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2541">it moves it to the bottom of the list, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2541">your online printers show up above your offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2545">printers, but you'll still be able to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2545">your offline printers at any time. If you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2549">actually not seeing the printer, then it might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2549">be that you're logged in with a different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2553">account. You have to be logged in with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2553">same account that you used to set up the printer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2558">or you can share the printer with your other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2558">account. But, yeah, we don't &mdash; the printer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2565">if you set it up once, it will always be part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2565">of your account so... </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2570"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So you mentioned for security, once a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2570">job is complete, you delete it. Is there any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2578">ability to retain that for at least a short </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2578">period so that you could reprint successful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2583">jobs? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2583"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So one thing you can do is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2585">if you are the printer receiving the jobs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2585">if you want to reprint successful jobs, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2590">only delete the job content when the status </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2590">gets set to done, so if you're the developer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2595">you could just set the status to be "in progress", </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2595">or move it from "in progress" back into queued, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2601">and with all of these different states we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2601">would retain the job on our side. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2604"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I guess what I would like to see is &mdash; is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2604">that ability when you're using the connector, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2609">so you've got an existing printer, but that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2609">capability magically from your end. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2616"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Sorry, I didn't catch exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2616">that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2621"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So maybe just the ability to automatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2621">keep a copy of everything you print in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2626">drive, so not choosing one or the other, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2626">archive. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2629"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: I see. I see. That would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2629">definitely be interesting looking into. I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2633">know there's definitely document retention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2633">and privacy implications around that as well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2638">because not everyone wants all their print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2638">jobs saved, but it's definitely something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2642">worth looking into. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2642"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2645"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I love Google Cloud Print by the way, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2645">but my question is say you're in Google Drive, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2651">and you have a picture file, I think if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2651">print it now, it like &mdash; it just comes out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2657">in a standard way. Are you guys like thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2657">of any options &mdash; like if you wanted a full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2662">page photo or like half page or like &mdash; is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2662">there a way to format it? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2666"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So currently your formatting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2666">options are limited to what the printer service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2670">is and the capabilities. Definitely over time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2670">we'll be expanding what those capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2675">are. Some things like scaling would be options </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2675">that are &mdash; that are part of the dialogue, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2680">but I think for now the best approach is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2680">client side just generate the PDF how you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2685">want it to look or just flow the image how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2685">you want it to look and then send it to our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2690">service, but, yeah, definitely it's future </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2690">work for us, but not currently there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2698"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: At &mdash; on my home system if I'm not logged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2698">in, and I see my son is logged in on the computer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2703">I can't print. Is there any work to have like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2703">an appliance that could just sit on the network, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2710">you know, a tiny little box that would prevent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2710">&mdash; or provide the cloud services so that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2716">don't have to worry about being logged in? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2716"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: There's &mdash; that's definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2721">a &mdash; something that's &mdash; a developer could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2721">technically build. We currently don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2726">anything like that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2726"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: We have source implementation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2729">for WRT support, in just &mdash; it's in early </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2729">stage, but (indiscernible) we implemented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2734">this, and the problem he faced is basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2734">a drivers problem. This implementation supports </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2740">pretty much every file as I remember, and, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2740">well, maybe something else, but it won't support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2747">like every single printer. And it's hard to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2747">implement one that will support every single </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2752">printer. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2752"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Where would I find that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2753"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Currently we don't link to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2753">it from anywhere, but we can talk to you after </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2757">the presentation. It's currently a project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2757">that's just on Google code that was published </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2761">by another Google engineer who built this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2761">as an enthusiastic side project. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2770"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So kind of back to the scaling. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2770">Say you have a printer that doesn't print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2774">8.5 x 11, and you print an image or a PDF, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2774">what happens? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2779">Does that get scaled down up to the media, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2779">or does it print at some, you know, fixed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">resolution conversion? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2785"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: I believe some of that depends </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2789">on the printer you're printing to. If there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2789">a fit-to-page option, then we currently service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2794">that and allow you to scale it down to whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2794">the output format is. Otherwise, I think the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2798">default behavior is just to print it out exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2798">how it is, so it might not be perfectly aligned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2804">when you're trying to print and 8.5 x 11 PDF </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2804">on your A4 paper. That is the current behavior. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2811">I think going forward we'll be working on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2811">expanding fit-to-page capabilities. But that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2815">why we were also mentioning the ideal experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2815">rather than scaling is you want your document </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2820">to be reflowed which is why we do recommend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2820">HTML for document submissions because we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2826">intelligently flow that for whatever printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2826">it's ending up on. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2830"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: But you don't necessarily have control </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2830">over what that source content is, if you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2837">to print some third party content that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2837">were just browsing to, say? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2842"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Yes, if it's &mdash; if it's, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2842">for example, a PDF that's 8.5 x 11 that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2846">want to print to A4 paper, then our best options </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2846">there are fitting to page or printing it out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2852">as it is, so we won't be able to intelligently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2852">reflow that in that case. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2858"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Can you please talk a bit more about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2862">setup you had on the first floor? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2862">Can I make one of my printers public? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2867"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Currently the setup we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2867">on our first floor is actually just part of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2871">a pilot that we're running to try and make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2871">printers public, so none of this UI is currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2877">available. That being said, depending on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2877">&mdash; we're basically trying this out as a pilot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2882">to see how people interact with it. I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2882">moving forward it might be something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2886">we pursue more seriously and open up to developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2886">and to users. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2892"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: If my printer is not cloud ready, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2892">do I print to it? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2898"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So if your printer is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2898">cloud-ready, you can set up the Chrome connector, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2903">so this is &mdash; or there's a slide earlier. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2903">Basically from within the &mdash; if your printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2908">is connected to a desktop or a laptop at home, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2908">you can go to Chrome settings and enable from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2914">advanced options, Google cloud print connector, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2914">which will take that printer and then share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2918">it with your Google account using that local </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2918">machine as a print server. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2925"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: The printer cannot be a network printer? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2925"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: It could be a network printer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2929">as long as &mdash; the only restriction is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2929">the laptop or the computer that you're using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2933">as the Cloud Print connector has to be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2933">to see that printer locally or over the network. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2939">It has to be part of the OS print dialogue. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2939"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2943"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: If the page has a specific CSS layout </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2943">for print media, will the print Cloud Print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2953"> &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2953"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: Specific print and layout so, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2959">yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2959"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: And also your https rasts API, can I set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2968">the orientation program &mdash; like orientation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2968">equals landscape or &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2975"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: Oh, yeah, it depends on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2975">printer. If printer supports orientation, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2979">we'll show orientation. If printer doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2979">support orientation, we don't do anything. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2984"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: No, no, I mean, I guess certain printers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2984">&mdash; for some reason it has to do with drivers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2990">that's not &mdash; exposed the API for software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2990">to control whether it always asks the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3006">what orientation, but were you able to experiment? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3006">Have you done it to programmatically set the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3013"> &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3013"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: With most printers you are able to programmatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3018">set the orientation using the capabilities, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3018">basically when you get your &mdash; when you fetch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3023">the capabilities for that printer, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3023">find the ones which correspond to orientation, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3029">set them in your print ticket, and then when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3029">you do your submit call, you can specify that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3032">print ticket with the orientation specified. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3032"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3037"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So you mentioned some esoteric encryption </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3037">solutions where I would implement my &mdash; a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3044">shared key or something with my clients. If </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3044">I need an end-to-end security where Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3053">never sees my content, would I have to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3053">that, or is there another option? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3056"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Yeah. So, as I mentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3056">earlier, you can &mdash; yeah, with end-to-end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3061">security such that we never see your content, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3061">the best solution currently that we have is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3066">for you to encrypt it client side and decrypt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3066">after receiving it. The disadvantage there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3070">is you lose the functionality for us to convert </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3070">the document because we can't read it, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3076">it would be completely invisible to us in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3076">that case. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3084"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3084"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi, you said raster data is either PDF, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3090">is there any plan to support XPSS or &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3090"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: The question was is there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3096">plans to support XPS as an output format. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3096">The answer is currently no. We're always looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3105">into new formats to explore, but for the &mdash; for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3105">the foreseeable future, PDF and PW Raster </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3112">are our primary formats going forward. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3112"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Is it because XPS is from Microsoft? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3117">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3117"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: I'm not going to comment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3123">on that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3123"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So kudos on Cloud Print. It's a very useful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3128">facility. We have a network, a guest network </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3128">that we let people connect in on, and we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3134">our printers on our private network. So Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3134">Print helps with that, being able to not have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3141">them on the same network, but one of the issues </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3141">is is being able to print from Word or other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3145">OS-level type printers. There's an open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3145">piece of software that lets you do that, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3151">apparently with that piece of software it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3151">only lets you print one copy at a time. Is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3155">there going to be anything supported by Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3155">that would allow, you know, printing from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3160">OSB first class, first class printing, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3160">from Mac OS or &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3165"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: We &mdash; yeah, we currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3165">don't have any plans to announce in that direction, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3169">but that's definitely something that &mdash; that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3169">we're looking into going forward, and currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3176">I guess the one way to get around the fact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3176">that that isn't currently there is to save </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3180">it as a PDF and then print it through Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3180">Print in Chrome, but, yeah, there's &mdash; we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3185">currently don't have stuff to announce but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3185"> &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3187"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: It makes the &mdash; the wife acceptance factor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3187">pretty low when you have to go through and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3192">do those kind of gyrations. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3192"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Absolutely. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3194"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: The second thing is is someone had mentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3194">about a device like one of the things I toyed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3199">around with is using raspberry pie and putting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3199">Google Cloud Print on something like that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3206">Is anyone at Google or on your team interested </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3206">in doing something like that, or would they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3210">support developers that were interested in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3210">doing a project like that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3215">Because that seems like that would be an ideal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3215">solution to provide printers, especially if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3220">you have a large investment in Legacy printers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3220">that you don't want to replace with Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3226">Cloud Printers. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3226"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Yeah. Absolutely. As I mentioned, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3230">we did have an engineer who put together a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3230">reference implementation of a Cloud Print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3234">server on a router, and that is all open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3234">on Google code, so I can hand you my contact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3239">information or you can message the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3239">groups and we'll be happy to point you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3244">the code, and also put you in touch with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3244">guy who wrote it so &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3246"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. Cool. Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3246"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: On that side. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3250"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I think he was before me. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3250"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: All right. I have two questions. First </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3256">question is how do you handle updates to capabilities? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3256">For example, you know, you have a server that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3264">got upgraded to handle duplex printing or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3264">the toners are completely out, you can't print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3269">anymore. Is it over XMPP? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3269"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So actually, we have an up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3273">&mdash; I didn't mention this API, but we do have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3273">an update API which allows you to do exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3278">that. It's basically an https call that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3278">printer makes. You specify new capabilities, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3284">what's changed since last time, and we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3284">automatically update all of that server side. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3288"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: That's over the tags, then? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3288"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: That's over https. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3292"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: And the second question is &mdash; I forgot. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3292">All right, I'll come back. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3298"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, so my questions are that when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3298">have multiple printers it's &mdash; it gets quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3305">hard to determine if they are &mdash; you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3305">the three different connectivity options, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3311">and it's very hard to determine which of them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3311">are connected in which ways, or at least used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3318">to be. So what's your opinion on that, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3318">in windows environments, in &mdash; at least in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3327">Windows 7, you can get an image of the printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3327">so you can see, oh, that's &mdash; that's one. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3333">Are there any developments in that direction? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3333"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So I guess a couple of different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3338">approaches we have are we do in our dialogue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3338">use iconography to distinguish different types </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3343">of printers. We also have a rename functionality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3343">that users can use on their side to name the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3350">printer such that you can differentiate between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3350">different printers. I don't know if there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3354">anything else I'm forgetting that kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3354">helps along these lines, but we have a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3360">of solutions in place. I know there's also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3360">a description field that you can specify as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3364">part of the printer which will show up in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3364">the print dialogue which you can use to differentiate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3368">different printers. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3368"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. Thank you. Would it be possible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3375">to group printers like on departments on functionality-wise, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3375">or it could also be &mdash; say if you have a mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3385">device or it feels that, okay, you're in this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3385">city or in this office, then these are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3392">available printers from the ones that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3392">close nearby? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3396"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So currently the answer to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3396">that is no, but we do sort of have a solution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3401">in place which is our search, our search in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3401">our Cloud Print Web dialogue search is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3406">only over printer names but over capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3406">and description fields. So one thing we do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3410">for example in Google is every printer has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3410">a description field for the building that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3414">it's in, so all I have to do is type my building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3414">name into the search dialogue and I'll see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3418">all the printers that are near me. Another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3418">thing is we also do &mdash; I think you mentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3422">grouping by capabilities, or what options </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3422">a printer can do, we do search over those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3426">as well, so if you search for I only want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3426">to see color printers, you can type in color </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3431">and just get a list of printers which can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3431">print to color. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3435"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, so new employees at Google, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3435">have like a thousand printers in your dialogues. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3441"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Uh-huh. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3441"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. Then you search for nearby &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3444"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Exactly. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3444"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3446"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: You usually only use a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3446">of them, and once you use printer, they will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3452">be on top basically. So you only need to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3452">search once or twice. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3460"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3460"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: When you submit print jobs, you have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3464">be locked in in the browser or in Android. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3464">Is there any way that a server application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3470">might be able to submit print jobs? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3470">The case I have, all the use case where we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3477">might be able to use this is one of our clients </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3477">runs a E commerce site, and they would love </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3482">to be able to use Cloud Print to print older </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3482">notifications as they come in. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3488"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: You can do that. You can create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3488">any account that you can share the printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3494">with, and then just using AUTH, you can authenticate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3494">server with this account and totally submit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3504">this account. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3504"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3505"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Yeah, we support both AUTH </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3505">and client login for authentication, so you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3510">could use that server side to authenticate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3510">into our API with a dummy Google account and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3515">then use that to submit print jobs. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3515"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Excellent. Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3520"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Sure. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3520"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. I'm wondering what kind of data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3525">has Google extract from my print jobs? Because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3525">privacy (indiscernible) but there must be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3531">some other reasons to process data. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3531"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: If the source and destination </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3537">formats of your print job are the same, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3537">let's say you're printing a PDF to a PDF, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3540">absolutely nothing. We just send the document </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3540">over to the printer without any conversion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3546">on our side. In terms of &mdash; so in terms of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3546">conversion, we do use a conversion service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3553">to convert your document to the format it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3553">needs to be in, but, yeah, as I mentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3558">before, the converted document will not persist </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3558">on our server for more than 30 days. The only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3563">thing I guess that stays left over are standard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3563">http logs, and also I guess the fact that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3570">within your account you'll see these &mdash; you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3570">see your print job history. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3573"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So Google has no content extraction kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3573">of &mdash; if I print my bank account statements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3579">it's not &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3579"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Not at all. We don't use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3582">your print jobs to serve ads. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3582">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3585"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Is there any update on the Android as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3585">an official Cloud Print, because as I recall, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3596">it was still something that was semi unofficial. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3596"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So, yeah, we are working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3603">on integrating with the Android properties </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3603">of Google Apps going forward, but as far as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3609">platform integration goes, we don't have anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3609">to announce at the moment. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3613"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: And then secondly, I think this has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3613">asked about three or four different ways, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3616">at least, but I'm not sure that I got it completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3616">straight. In our office, for instance, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3623">have a large group of people that come in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3623">and out, and we have Legacy printers, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3631">I didn't really want to leave the Legacy printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3631">connected to a machine on my account, since </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3637">I'm not there all the time, amongst other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3637">things, but also the machines themselves are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3643">generally public, so I ended up putting it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3643">on one of the administrator's &mdash; one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3646">administrator's accounts and leaving it there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3646">but it doesn't seem to be any way to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3651">that done without having a specific account </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3651">which you then can delegate out of. That's, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3658">I think, the summarization of everything that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3658">I've heard. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3660"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: In terms of accounts are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3660">you referring to like log-in accounts? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3666"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: They have to have a Gmail account in order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3666">to be able to have a printer &mdash; in order to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3672">be able to attach it to a legacy printer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3672">which they can then share. And there's no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3678">other way around that that I can figure. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3678"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Just in general, enterprise printing I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3682">guess would be the question and how do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3682">take a set of enterprise printers and let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3687">a specific set of people or even make it public, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3687">which is kind of what you're doing downstairs. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3693">Is that going to be available soon or when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3693">is that going to be available? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3696"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: I guess in terms of both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3696">questions, with having an account in order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3701">to register a printer, you do need a Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3701">account in order to register your printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3706">with Cloud Print. That being said, it doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3706">have to be your Google account or someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3709">else's. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3709">A lot of the enterprises that we work with, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3712">to answer your question, use what they call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3712">a roll account, which is just a dedicated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3717">Google account that they set up for the express </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3717">purpose of printing that they can share access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3722">to, and they'll use that to run the print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3722">server so that way no one has to use their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3727">personal account to &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3727"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Is there a way to &mdash; so if you have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3731">set of employees, is there a way to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3731">the printer with them or basically make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3736">available in their preferences so they don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3736">have to be accepting invitations for this? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3740"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Absolutely. So we're working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3740">on expanding more of that going forward, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3745">what you can already currently do is share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3745">it with a group. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3749">So for example, let's say you have a Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3749">group that encompasses everyone within your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3751">domain. You can from within the share interface </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3751">that we demoed earlier, just type in that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3756">group. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3756">And all that needs to happen is the owner </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3759">of that group can accept the invitation on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3759">behalf of people in the organization. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3766"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3766"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I develop an application that actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3772">works like print server, and the printer is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3772">a terminal printer, and I control the printer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3778">by escape comments. So I open the LPT port </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3778">and send comments. How about in that case? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3786"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So this is with a terminal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3786">printer that you account to over LPR? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3792"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yes, but it's connected to my applications. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3792">There is no drivers, there is no &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3797"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: I see. If there's no standard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3797">print drivers, we won't be able to integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3802">that with Cloud Print. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3802">So currently &mdash; I'm assuming you want to set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3805">up the Cloud Print connector from within Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3805">to share it with your Cloud Print account? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3810">In that case we only take the local printers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3810">which are actually in your OS print dialogue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3815">to share. So we won't be sharing it unless </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3815">it's &mdash; unless it uses the standard OS print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3820">mechanism to receive print jobs. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3820"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. But is it &mdash; can I make a connector </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3827">to the Google server? Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3827"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3830"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I remembered the question now. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3830">So you mentioned you can print to your mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3840">Nexus, right? What does that mean? Like it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3840">just PDF on the flash drive? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3846"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Exactly. What we do is we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3846">take the job, we convert it to a PDF and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3850">we push a notification to your device that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3850">starts a download of that PDF. So you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3856">even have to be running Chrome as Android. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3856">It runs as a background service using Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3860">push. So you can print anything to your phone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3860">and it just shows up as a PDF on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3860">the device. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3870">Next questions. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3870"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Getting back to the non-cloud-ready printer. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3872">You said you simply do this from a PC or something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3872">like that. Is there some software you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3875">to load on to the PC in order for it to act </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3875">as the server? I assume it's acting as a cloud-ready </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3880">server. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3880"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: So currently it works within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3882">Google Chrome. You have to have Chrome installed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3882">on that PC. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3886"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Chrome OS? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3886"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: No, just the Chrome browser. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3890">So from within the settings on Google Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3890">you can configure your local printers to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3894">cloud ready. And there's no additional software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3894">apart from Google Chrome required. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3897"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So then it acts as a cloud-ready server. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3897"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Exactly. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3905"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3905"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: One more. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3907">Can you tell us about Cloud Print integration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3907">with Google Apps, like sharing to groups, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3914">et cetera? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3914"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Yeah. In terms of apps integration, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3919">we do support &mdash; is this for enterprise in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3919">particular? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3921"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3921"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Yeah. For enterprise integration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3925">we have &mdash; currently our consumer solution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3925">for most part is our enterprise solution. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3930">There are plans to move that into a more custom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3930">enterprise solution going forward. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3936">But yeah, for now integration we offer at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3936">a basic level is &mdash; as we mentioned you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3943">configure Chrome to run as a headless server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3943">on Linux and then also with group sharing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3949">you can easily share printers with groups </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3949">of people. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3954"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So if that's &mdash; if you add a new user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3954">to a group, if we have a group called printers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3962">and we have five or ten printers connected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3962">to that group and you add a new user to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3968">group, would he automatically have the print </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3968">when he log on to his new account? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3974"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: Yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3974"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. Excellent, thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3978"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Cool. Do we have one more? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3978">All right. Last question. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3984"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Normally the driverless printing is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3984">myth, used to be, but you guys has really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3991">done a good job that it can be a reality. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3991">I really appreciate that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3997"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3997"><span class="speakerName">Yuri Dolgov</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3998"><span class="speakerName">Akshay Kannan</span>: Thank you so much. Thanks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3998">a lot, everyone. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4000">[ Applause ] </span></p>
