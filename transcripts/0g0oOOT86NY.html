<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Hi. Welcome. Thanks for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">coming back after lunch. We'll get started. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="6">I'm Alex Komoroske. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="6"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: And I'm Matt McNulty. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="9"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: And we both work on Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">on the Open Web Platform team. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">Now, before we get really started I just want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">to reiterate that this is an intermediate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">level talk, so if you saw Eric's talk just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">before this, before lunch, you're probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">all set. If not, there are going to be a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">of points where you're just scratching your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="24">head, and what you want to do is review some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="24">of the other specs and tutorials on some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">these emerging web standards afterwards. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="29"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: And all children should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">leave the room as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="34"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So if you saw Eric's talk, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">you're probably thinking to yourself, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">know, "Wow, web components sounds really cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">Specifications are being finalized. Browsers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">are starting to implement them." But... </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="44"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: But if you're a web developer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">you're thinking, "I probably can't use these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">things. Call me in a few years when I actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">can and when this is actually relevant to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">me." </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="56"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So the good news for you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">is actually that this stuff works in all modern </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">browsers today. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="60"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So here I have a version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">of TODOMDC. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="66"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: And if you don't know what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">TODOMDC is, it's just a reference application. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">It's something that people use to write this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">application again in their framework to compare </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">it and see how it feels compared to other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">frameworks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="78"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: But the interesting thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">about this one, if I inspect elements, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">it uses web components. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">So you see the entire thing is wrapped up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">in a TD dash app tag. And if I go into settings, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">I can click show Shadow DOM, leave, reinspect, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">and you'll see now I can actually open that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">node and the grayed-out document fragment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">is actually a sign that you're in Shadow DOM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">now. So this entire little world inside this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">tag is encapsulated from the outside world. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">There's a hard border at the edge. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="117"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Okay. But so that's easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">because that's Chrome, so what about something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">harder? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="122"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: All right. In this VM which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">I've paused, because that seems to be the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">best way to get Windows to stay up for this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">period of time &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">[ Laughter ] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">Matthew McNulty: &mdash; for purposes of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">presentation I've got it here in IE as well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">in Windows 8. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="137"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So it's the same code using, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="137">again, these concepts of Shadow DOM web components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">that's working in IE. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="143">So how did we do this? How did we make this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">happen? Well, the answer is that we're impatient. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="146">We're really excited about web components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">but we didn't want to wait to use them until </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">they were in every modern browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="155">The other important thing is we work on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">Chrome team where some of the folks who are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">actively standardizing the web components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">stuff in the standards bodies, and when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">designing new web standards, it's really important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">to experiment with them, especially if they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">very complex. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="167">What you don't want is you work on a specification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">for a while, you build consensus, you implement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">it, you ship it, and then you use it and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">go, "Oooh, wow, that's really hard to use." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">And so you want to experiment with this stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">and feed that feedback directly back into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">the standardization process before it gets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">locked in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="184">So you want to, you know, improve these standards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">and not just work around them. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="189">So we started what was kind of a crazy experiment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">to see if we could make this stuff work in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">modern browsers. We started a project a number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">of months ago on Github doing everything fully </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">in public. We called it Toolkitchen until </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">a few days ago when we renamed it Polymer. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="202"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: We renamed it a few times, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">actually. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="205"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: If you were working on it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">closely, there were two renames in short succession. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">We've already gotten some really good community </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">participation from folks who have found out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">about it and provided feedback. We're really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">happy about that. And we've also been able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">to provide feedback back into the specification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">process to help identify some areas in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">specs that we thought needed to change. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="227"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So we're focused on modern </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">browsers for a couple of reasons. Older browsers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">you just can't polyfill some of this stuff. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">And really it's &mdash; you know, it's time for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">a break. We want to move forward. And we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">want anyone who is using this stuff to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">left behind, kind of like the current older </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">browsers that don't update. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">You know, you're headed for trouble if all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">do you is stare in the rearview mirror. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">So this approach is hard. We didn't know it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">would work. We actually didn't really know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">it would work for the first six months or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">so, whether we could actually get this stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">working in a way that really emulated the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">future platform in a way that we could work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">together and form a coherent system. We've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">been working with all the different standards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">bodies and providing feedback, as Alex said. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="268"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: But the point is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">that it does work today and it brings you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">the future and allows you to build on top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">of it today. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">So the way I think about this is what's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">implemented in browsers today is like the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">bedrock. It's a solid foundation but it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">kind of uneven because different browsers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">have different support for different things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">The answer to this is polyfills. Not a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">concept. A polyfill is a JavaScript library </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">that basically mocks out a future standard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">so that you can use it before it actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">is deployed in all modern browsers. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">The goal with polyfills is to have really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">high fidelity, so that way, later you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">even need it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="303"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So perfect fidelity is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">not always possible in some of these things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">Everyone always goes, "Oh, but what about" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">and they're usually right. So things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">styling scoping, encapsulation in any real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">significant way, are just not possible in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">JavaScript but we've gotten pretty close. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="319"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So we'll go over these polyfills </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">very briefly. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">These are each &mdash; almost all of these are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">emerging standards so we only have a chance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">to say about a sentence about each one. If </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">you are wondering what these are, check out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">the specs, check out the tutorials to learn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">more about these. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="333"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So mutation observers allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">for the efficient observations of DOM, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">when new nodes are added or attributes are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">changed. This one is actually already shipping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">in most modern browsers. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="344"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So the next one is pointer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">events. This is a specification that unifies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">the event models for touch and mouse. It allows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">you to write the same code and have it run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">on mobile devices and desktop devices as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">In fact, everything we're showing you here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">today works both on desktop and on mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">devices. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="360"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So Shadow DOM is a pillar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">of web components. This brings encapsulation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">to the platform for the first time. Which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">is really, really, really big and we'll show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">that to you a little bit. It's also incredibly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">complicated, especially to grasp right away, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">but the big &mdash; the big point is it gives you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">the ability to encapsulate things within a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">tag. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">And so if you need to know more about that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">I refer you to Eric's talk that happened just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">before this one, or just before lunch. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="384"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: The next one is custom elements. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">This is another pillar of web components. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">It allows you to define your own tags and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">have them operate just like any other tags </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">in the browser. It allows you to create these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">elements and put whatever you want inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">of them, even ones of arbitrary complexity, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">and have them treated just like any other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">tag that you're familiar with, like the video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">tag or Canvas or whatever. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="405"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: HTML imports. This one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">was known as a few different things. Link </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">rel imports, web components itself briefly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">for a little bit, but now it's HTML imports. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">And the big thing with this one, it allows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">you to package CSS, JavaScript, HTML, into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">a single module and import it into your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="423">and it allows reusability across multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="423">applications or multiple parts of your application. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="427"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So this next one is MDV, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">which stands for "model driven views." This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">is the only one in this list that isn't really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">an emerging standard yet although hopefully </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">one day it will be. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">It's something that allows you to do data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">binding directly in HTML. And as we've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">playing with all of these, this is one that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">really allows us to eliminate a lot of boilerplate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">code in practice. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="447"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So web animations unifies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">CSS and SVG animations and exposes the primitives </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">beneath those and allows you to create really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">complex animation sequences separate from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">the things you want to animate. It's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">a really, really cool project. It predates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">when we started working on toolkitchen, now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">polymer. And actually Mozilla, Google, Adobe, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">were all collaborated on that polyfill and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">it's included. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="471"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So together, these form </span><span class="line" data-startTime="471">a stable foundation that allows you to pretend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">like you're living in the future and build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">there. So the cool thing about polyfills is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">that over time as the &mdash; as browser vendors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">implement these features, the need for them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">goes away, and so ultimately at some point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">in the future you wouldn't even need this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">layer at all. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="488"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So and one of the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">great things about this is we designed this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">to be a la carte. So you can use each individual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">&mdash; each individual polyfill or you can combine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">a couple together or you can take the entire </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">thing, and if you want, actually, to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">the entire platform and minimize a gzip version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">of that, it's actually only 31K. So think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">about that. That's actually the entire future </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">of the web platform for about the size of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">an icon. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="516"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Most of the future of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">web platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="518">So we've been talking about modern browsers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="518">Let me define that real quick. This is our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">compatibility chart for our polyfills. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">includes Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari, also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">their mobile variants. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="528">We call these the evergreen browsers. These </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">are browsers that are modern. They support, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">many of them, the new standards. They also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">importantly keep their users updated by default. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="537">So users don't have to do anything unusual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">just to stay on the newest one. So the users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">aren't going to live in the past for long. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="546">When there's a new version, they'll just come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">along to the new version, which is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="549">Okay. So web components provides &mdash; this foundation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">layer provides a lot like a utility belt that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">allows you to build apps but it's not everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">you need. You need some higher-level stack </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">pieces to fit them together and really make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">them work together. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="561"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: We realized we needed to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="564">build a toolkit. So this toolkit, which we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="564">call polymer, it weaves together all of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">lower level pieces of the platform into a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">whole cloth for building applications. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="575">also where we express our opinion on top of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="575">that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="577"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So this layer, unlike the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">layer below it which will disappear over time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">this layer will continue to exist because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">it's not part of any spec. It's our opinion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">on how to use these things productively together. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">Although hopefully maybe if these kinds of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">patterns become popular and other libraries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">use them too, maybe this is something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">could be specified in a web standard in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">future, maybe. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="599"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So we started out with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">some core principles to build a new kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">toolkit, right? One with the future in mind. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">So this is &mdash; you know, we're leaving behind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="609">the past. We've got these new toys to play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="609">with. What can we do if we actually had all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">of these things and does it actually work? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="612"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So these principles are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="617">use the platform, eliminate boilerplate, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="617">everything is an element. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="621"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So use the platform. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">this is a big change, at least for me and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">others who have built JavaScript frameworks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">before. You know, for the most part, the web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">has been not particularly great &mdash; a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">spot to build Webapps. The platform, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">Alex said &mdash; right? &mdash; it's rocky, it's uneven </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">on the bottom of the. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="638">And, you know, as a result, a lot of really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">really talented JavaScript developers have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">spent their time building frameworks and building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">these entire worlds and separate render trees </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">and doing really kind of crazy amazing things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">like using iFrames to force rendering behavior </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">in the browser, you know, just to get around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">problems &mdash; problems on the platform. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="658">So, you know, we were tasked very specifically, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">you know, no tricks. So if you hit a problem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">and, you know, something doesn't work well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">you know, we're on the Chrome team so we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">actually allowed to go to the guy around the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">corner in the next cube and say, "Hey, can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="672">you fix this?" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="672">Alex Komoroske: "Let's file a bug. Let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">get that fixed." </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="674"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: A bug, yeah. So we wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">to use the platform, not just the existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">platform but this new platform. We have all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">these new toys that we're being given. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">wanted to see what we could do with them. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="683"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: The next one is to eliminate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">boilerplate. So on this team we're very, very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">adamant about that, that you should only write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">the code that's unique to your app and nothing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="692">more. You shouldn't have to be recreating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="692">these things every single time you're writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">an app. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="695"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: And everything is an element. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">This one is really, really important but I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">going to hammer it home about a hundred more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">times so you can not pay attention to this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">one. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">So the idea is every single thing is a module, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">right? And you use an element. And you build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">applications out of bigger and bigger elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">made &mdash; made of more and more elements, up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">to and including an actual app. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">By doing this, you've got all these reasonable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">little portions. You keep the developer's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">context really local. You reduce bugs. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">it makes it so that, you know, from the perspective </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">of a developer at any given time, an application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">can be arbitrarily &mdash; sorry, arbitrarily simple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">and complex at the same time. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">So we wanted a system that weaves together </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">the platform to enable component-based apps. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">So everything is an element and every &mdash; and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">all elements have Shadow DOM encapsulating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">them. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">Polymer makes building elements easier, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">from the outside &mdash; you know, from the inside, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">you're building your own in polymer. From </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">the outside, it's just an element. It looks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">like every other DOM element. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="759"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So just like every other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">DOM element, the way you pass in configuration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">is via attributes and the way you pass things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">out of it is via element, so from the outside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">perspective, it's just an element. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="767"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So this is an example of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">polymer JS element. This one is a polymer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">panels element, so all custom elements need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">to have a dash in the name. That's the only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">requirement. It used to be an X dash. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">this allows for different vendors to provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">their own prefix to things, and namespace </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">to things, and it's important to note this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">is not XML namespacing. There's, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">no collision detection or things like that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="791">People just have to be on good behavior. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="796">So in this case, it's a polymer panels app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">that would provide like say a series of sliding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">panels or a carousel or something like that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="801">So one of the first big features that we add </span><span class="line" data-startTime="807">is declarative mapping of custom and DOM events </span><span class="line" data-startTime="807">to methods within the element. So in this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">case when a select event is fired, the panel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">select handler element with that method name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">&mdash; this is not code that's executed &mdash; will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">be rerun on the actual element. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="823"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So again, this makes it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">easy to behave just like any other element </span><span class="line" data-startTime="827">and pass things out via events. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="827"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: Yeah. And one of the nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">things we like about this is rather than like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">what's currently in vogue with add event listener </span><span class="line" data-startTime="834">and for security reasons, we've reestablished </span><span class="line" data-startTime="834">a way of doing it in declarative. Kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">the whole thing we're doing here &mdash; you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">every single thing we do, we can also do imperatively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="844">but we like the idea of the, you know, declarative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="844">renaissance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="849">So the next thing is custom attributes. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="849">you've got custom elements, you need custom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">attributes. This is the API that your element </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">exposes to the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="857">And then one of the big things we add is data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">binding and this is powered by MDV. This radically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">reduces code complexity. We'll &mdash; we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">to demo this in a little bit so we'll get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">into it more. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="866">And there's a whole bunch more, but this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">the big picture, and if you combine all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">this with all the new platform bits, you end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">up with something pretty awesome. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="874"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So as we're using this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">this already made it much easier to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">apps but we weren't satisfied because we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="881">realizing that we were rebuilding the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="881">kind of UI widgets again and again. And, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">know, every framework that wants to make an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">easy-to-build app, they should help you build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">UIs as well. We really need to build a set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">of really great widgets, and so we've just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">begun that a few weeks ago. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="893">So I want to &mdash; this is a &mdash; this is the &mdash; sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">of completing this diagram. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="899">I want to take a moment to reflect really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">quickly on our approach. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="901">So a lot of other frameworks are sort of forced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">to do everything in script. They have to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">very, very, very clever engineering to replace </span><span class="line" data-startTime="912">the pot from below them because it doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="912">do the things they need. So they end up building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">their own parallel universes that don't inter-operate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">very well because they've created their own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">worlds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="919">What we were trying to do is fix the platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">and actually provide feedback back to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">platform, use the emerging standards. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="927">And we &mdash; actually, one thing that's cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">about web components is that your interoperability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="931">layer is just the DOM because an element is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="931">an element, you know how to work it. And that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">means that for the first time actually it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">possible for UI elements to be interoperable. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="940">So you'll see in this diagram &mdash; it's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">very, very hard to see here &mdash; there's other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">boxes to the right of this, because other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">UI elements could be built on top of some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">of these layers or the foundation and inter-operate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">with them. And we'll show you a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">more about that later. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="952">They're &mdash; also in polymer, we've taken a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">layered approach to everything. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="956">So if you want to use our UI elements, great, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">you get the whole stack. If you just want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">to use a single polyfill by itself, cool, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">just take that one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="964">Or anything in between. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="966">So you can sort of figure out exactly how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="966">much of this stuff you want to use. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="970">So we've been talking a whole lot about this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="970">Let's &mdash; but rather than continue to just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="973">talk about it, let's show you how all this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="973">stuff works. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="977"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: All right. So here we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="977">a code editor. This is actually just the ace </span><span class="line" data-startTime="985">code editor that we threw in a browser with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="985">some other fancy stuff, and this is an element </span><span class="line" data-startTime="991">definition. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="991">So if you saw this from Eric's talk, it should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">be somewhat familiar. This one is, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">ever so slightly different because it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">polymer element. But the basics are still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">there. So you've got an element tag. In this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1000">case, the name attribute says it's my dash </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1000">element. That means that's the tag we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">to create. So whenever this element definition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">is around, the tag that says "my element" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1008">will include all of this stuff. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1008">The template tag is the DOM that you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1012">to stamp out when this &mdash; when this tag is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1012">used. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">There's actually a whole bunch of really cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">things you can do with template and iterate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1018">and all these other things. I'd encourage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1018">you to go look that up after this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">And then there's the script tag which provides </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">the prototype for the element and various </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">behaviors, if you want to add. So in this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">case we'll just start out really simple and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1031">I'll add a div, "hello world." </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1031"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So if you can't see it &mdash; I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1038">know this is a big room. Back there, if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1038">can't see it, we can zoom it a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1042">maybe, but check it out. All this stuff is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1042">in the repo afterwards. We can provide the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1051">you the link. Sorry about that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1051"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: There you go. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">So now for previews. Look at that. "Hello </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">world." </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1059"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: That is amazing. Absolutely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">mind blowing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1062">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1062"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: But if I look inside it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">you can see here's our element definition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">that we created and right next to it is an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">actual instance of my element. And inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">that is Shadow DOM, so everything is encapsulated. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1073">And inside that, you can see our div. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1073"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So if you're scratching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">your head, this is the point where we remind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">you this is an intermediate level talk and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1080">if this confuses you, you should check out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1080">&mdash; learn more about Shadow DOM. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1084">So in fact, to see this stuff, Shadow DOM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1084">inspector, you actually have to check an option </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1088">to see it. It's not available by default because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1088">it's encapsulation. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1092"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: All right. So one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1092">cool things is you don't actually have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">use just normal DOM elements in here. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">can have custom elements that include other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">custom elements. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">So in this case, I'm going to switch it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">one of our custom elements, G ratings. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">this element is cool for a few reasons. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">very easy to type, so I can't mistype it here. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">It doesn't need any properties or attributes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">by default. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">And what it gives you is a bunch of stars </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">you can click on. It's like a star rating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">thing. Preview it, and look at that. We've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">got stars. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1122"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So these are just custom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1126">elements, so if you're looking at this in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1126">the DOM as another library, it's just an element. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">You know how to work it. Attributes in, events </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">out. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1131"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: Yeah. There it is still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">in my element, and then here you can start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">to see Shadow DOM within Shadow DOM and all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">of the markup within. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">All right. So this is pretty cool but you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">like, "Oh, you've got your own little tool." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1143">Alex Komoroske: "Your own little universe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1143">that you've built." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1145">Matthew McNulty: "You're probably, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1145">cheating somehow." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">So we can take the source for that document </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">we're creating, bring it over to JS bin, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">it's the same thing. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1156"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: It looks like a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">of boilerplate here. There is only a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">of pieces that make are actually crucial to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">make this work. So the point is it is very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">easy to use this within other contexts. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1166">So we believe you. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1166">By the way, this is all HTML. But let's go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1169">a little bit faster so we don't bore them. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1169"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So it would be boring to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">sit here and watch me write HTML. So we did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">something to make it a little bit faster and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1177">more interesting. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1177">We built an element builder. So this is just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">the product of the last few weeks. We know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">we are not really planning on shipping a tool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1185">any time soon. It allows you to build elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1185">and bind them together into new elements and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1190">really explore it. It is a nice little showcase </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1190">for what we have built so far and the technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1194">underneath. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1194"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So I am going to reiterate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">that. This is just a demo tool. It is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">an ID. You don't need to use this to use polymer. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">It is just for playing around with the stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">and getting a feel for it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1203"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So we can rate Alex so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1203">far. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1205"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Oh, thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1205"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: We can change it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1208"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Not so nice. Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1208"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: You can see I'm changing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">things in here, the number of stars selected, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">the values are changing over here in the property </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">inspector. This tool should be &mdash; this kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">of tool is pretty familiar for a lot of people. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1220">You have got a palette down the left-hand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1220">side. You have got a tool bar across the top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">and then a property inspector down the right-hand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">side. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1226"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Can you flip to the code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">real quick? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1228"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So it is not doing anything. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">It actually just changes the attribute in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">the tag. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1235"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Basically all this tool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">is doing is just a convenience for piping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">in those attributes to save you typing yourself. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">It is not doing anything magic. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1240"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: All right. So that's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1246">tool to begin with. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1246">Let's do something more interesting with MDV. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1250">So if I pull out a few other widgets, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1250">do some tabs and a menu and a caption. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1257">won't make any sense, but it will show something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1257">really kind of interesting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1260">So I can tap around on these things. Tap around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1260">on them independently. If I come over to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">code, you can see that when I inserted that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">I actually just inserted a bunch of custom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1271">tags and even some normal native DOM tags. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1271">So the tabs takes a bunch of spans. The menu </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1277">takes a bunch of menu items. And then the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1277">caption is actually just a div. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1282">So one of the really cool features of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1282">toolkit is MDV. MDV allows you to bind elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">together and attributes together without any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">actual code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1294">So at first I'm actually going to add a variable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1294">to the prototype of the element here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1301"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: A property you would be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1301">able to use just like any other JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1303">object. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1303"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: I can add however many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">I want. And then if I come up to any attribute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">within the element, in this case "selected," </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1315">I can use this double mustache syntax which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1315">is MDV and say &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1319"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So with this G menu, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">way you specify which one is selected again </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">is with an attribute just like any other element. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1325"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So now the tabs and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1329">menu in this case both have a selected attribute. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1329">That is not at all required. It is because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1334">they both have the concept of what's selected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1334">in the selected index. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1337">I come back to the code now, except for that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1337">one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1340">(Chuckles.) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1340">There we go. Just had to clear the CSS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1343">You can see them connected together. And you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">can actually do this right in the tool as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1352">well. So instead of just a caption, I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1352">click this little linked and put in the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">thing. And now they're all tied together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1359">Now, I can take this entire thing and say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">"publish," clear the canvas, and now the whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">thing is itself a custom element that I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1375">drag off the palette and it still goes together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1375">And not only that, you can see the myselected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1381">property that I added to the prototype and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1381">even the foo one, even though it doesn't actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1385">do anything. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1385">All right. So we built a custom element and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1390">all without doing any JavaScript actually. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1390"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: It is actually kind of cool, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1392">right? We tie these things together. If you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1392">look in the code view for this one as well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1396">you will see that this is just now a my element. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1396">The stuff inside is sort of hidden away. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1401">pass the myselected that we defined in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1401">prototype just there as an attribute. It wires </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1405">all this stuff up together for you so you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1405">don't have to write any script to get this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">kind of behavior. It is pretty cool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1408"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: One of the other really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1412">cool things is you can make your own custom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1412">elements. And one of the other uses for that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">is you can wrap up existing functionality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">on the Web and put it in a single tag. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1420">it is encapsulated from the rest of your page, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1420">so you don't have any conflicts or system-level </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1425">dependencies that you're creating. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1425">In which case, we'll show you one &mdash; really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1429">crazy one from our friends at Mozilla actually. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1429">They built a one megabyte PDF Viewer entirely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">in JavaScript. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1436"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Which is crazy but awesome. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1438"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: We have the complete works </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">of Chaucer in here. If you go to the code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1443">you can see it is actually just a single tag. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1443"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: This is kind of crazy, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">Like, you are used to including all these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">scripts and having these weird dependencies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">and stuff. You just write a few characters, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">one include, write a few characters, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">have a PDF Viewer directly in your page. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">really changes how you think about architecting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">your applications. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1457"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: We have got other ones </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1459">in here that we just threw again in the last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1459">few weeks. We've got charts and things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1463"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: These are just open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1464">libraries other people have built. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1464"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: Again, they are just all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">wrapped into a single tag. It gives you this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">almost module pattern that you can use to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">combine things from different vendors. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1470">One the other neat things you can to do is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">use Web animations, which we talked about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">earlier. I can actually bring out a few slightly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">fancier widgets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1480">Let's do a clock. So just for the demo, like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1492">you know, tags don't actually have to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1492">UI, right. Like, a script tag doesn't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">anything visual about it. But just for this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">demo, we came over &mdash; actually we'll do flip </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">&mdash; and made it so these things have a UI so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">we can click on them in the canvas and do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1506">interesting things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1506">In this case, it is a flip animation. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1510">we can say, you know, let's flip the clock. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1510">Let's do it for a second. Now, if I come back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1515">here and click on it. Clock flips. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1515"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So behind the scenes, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">is just using Web animations. Again, another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">emerging standard. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1523">But the cool thing about thinking about animations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1523">configured via these non-visible elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1529">is that you can separate the animation that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1529">you're defining from the element itself and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">just sort of point at the other one. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">The elements don't have to be visual. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1537">one of the cool things when everything is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1537">an element. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1539"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: Yeah, so &mdash; and one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1539">the other really cool things that Web animations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1543">gives you is the ability to do really long, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1543">really complex, intricate animations and separate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1549">from what their target is, right? And you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1549">can just define this and drag it out however </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1552">you want. You reuse it and all of that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1552">So, in this case, we have a whole group. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1557">you can say let's bounce the clock this time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1557">Let's flip the weather because it is not that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">nice out. And let's change up the market because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">I have run out of puns. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1571">Now if I do it, you can see they do one after </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1571">the other. Or I can actually make it happen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1575">in parallel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1575">So just a little taste of what you can do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1580">with Web animations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1580">Another thing we're doing is experimenting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">with responsive design and building it directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">into the widgets. I can come over here. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1591">is another version of the Sandbox, not full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1591">screen, so I can actually change the window </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1597">size. If I come in here and I start shrinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1597">this down, you can see it has got a toolbar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1601">across the top of the drop-down menu. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1601">if I shrink it small enough, hey, it drops </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">down to the bottom and splits because it says, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">Hey, it is phone or tablet size now and automatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">flips to be a little menu that pops up that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">more of a phone size, full-screen, full-bleed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1615">kind of treatment. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1615">So this is not just theoretical, but we really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">just got it started &mdash; just getting started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">with this kind of element. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1623">And, in fact, everything you see here works </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1623">on mobile, especially because we're using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1628">pointer events. So we're not going to put </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1628">this on the camera or anything. But you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">actually on my iPad, if I can hold it straight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">&mdash; drag stuff out on the palette from my iPad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1639">and it just works. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1639"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: All this stuff is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1641">early. We just started playing around with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1641">this. We are approaching this entire project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1645">with a very mobile-first perspective. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1645">The ideal we're working towards is that as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">a developer, you write your code once, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">define, okay, this is a menu or what have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">you and then it automatically adjusts across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">mobile or desktop or tablet to do the right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">thing for you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1658"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: All right. So we've shown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1662">that you can drag a bunch of elements out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1662">to make other elements. You can bind them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1665">together arbitrarily. You can use third-party </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1665">code. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">Let's actually try to put all of this together </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">into something fun. So we have a YouTube widget. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">We call this the "I'm feeling lucky" YouTube </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">widget because all it does is take the very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1677">first query and play it. See the little Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1677">commercial. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">I also call it the "I'm feeling risky" demo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">widget. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1691"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: That's a wholesome commercial, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1691">though, so we're okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1694"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: This is a cat video I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">using earlier in which I discovered last night </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1698">the people in the background were cursing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1698">I never had the sound on. So that one went </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1702">out the window. Let's give this one a border. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1702"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: It is just a normal element </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">so you can do whatever you want. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1708"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: Yeah, just a normal element. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1711">And we can actually use the speech input in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1711">here. And we combine the YouTube query instead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1722">of using this plain Chrome commercial query </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1722">to the input's value. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1730">Now if I come here and the sound system and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1730">demo gods are in alignment, I can go "cats." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">And we've got all the cats. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1747"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Again, if you check out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">this code, there is &mdash; great, now we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">distracting cats on the screen. Thank you, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">Matt. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1757">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1757"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: If you check out that code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">it is just using that MDV syntax to plug those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">things together. The magic isn't from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">Sandbox app. The magic is from the platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">and that layer &mdash; that sugar layer that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">call polymer. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1768"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: We can do multiple cats </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1772">across the screen and really annoy Alex. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1772"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So all this stuff is great. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">But you have seen this kind of thing before. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">Other frameworks have done similar kinds of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1783">things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1783">What is cool about this Web components approach </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1786">where you have actual encapsulation between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1786">them is it allows for the first time the potential </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1791">for components from of different sets to intermingle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1791">seamlessly. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1796">So in this world, interoperability layer is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1796">the DOM. And everyone knows how to use the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">DOM, how to pass an attribute to receive events </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">out. Again, the polyfill &mdash; the polymer library </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1805">as well is layered, so you can take just the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1805">parts you want. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1808"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So one of the cool things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1808">we have been doing lately is our friends at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1811">Mozilla have been building X tags in their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1811">X tags library which is similar in concept </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">to the polymer widgets on top of the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">foundation layer that we showed you before. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1820"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: They are experimenting with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">using one of our polyfills in their system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">as well. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1823"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: Yeah. So it took us no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">time at all to put them in the palette, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">I can actually drag out some of their widgets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1828"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So let me just emphasize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">this. These are widgets that come from a separate, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">a different framework that are also built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1833">on top of Web components. So we can just seamlessly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1833">use them in the same environment, in the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">app. This is kind of mind blowing, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">This is very new. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1841"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: And one of the really cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1841">things is because this is just Web components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">and these are just elements and you can bind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">them together just like any other DOM elements, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">we can take our toggle button and we combine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">its value to the X tag switch.

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1861"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So that's two separate libraries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">playing together seamlessly. So we think that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">this interoperability potential for Web components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1871">is a really big deal. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1871">If you think about everything as an element, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1875">you can have small building blocks, package </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1875">them up into larger building blocks. Before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">you know it, you have entire reusable applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">all in one tag. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1883"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So up to and including </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1883">this entire Sandbox application, which was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1887">built using polymer. And as a result, we put </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1887">it in the palette. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">[ Laughter ] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">And we can pull it out. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1898">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1898"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: That's cool, but we must </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">go deeper. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1903"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: All right. Everyone get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">your totems ready. We have had an inception </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">reference. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1908"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: That's pretty cool. This, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1908">in the past, would have required very careful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">planning, following all the rules, all this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">kind of stuff. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1921">With Web components and polymer, you just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1921">get this kind of encapsulation for free. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">actually &mdash; so we've started building this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">app just a few weeks ago actually as the foundation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">layers got pretty solid. We were amazed how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">quickly we could build it because when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1934">are using these concepts to build elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1934">and then larger elements out of them, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1939">are so much more productive. It is like a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1939">whole new world. It is really cool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1942"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So that's polymer and Sandbox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1942">as it exists right now. If you are adventurous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1948">and unafraid of living on the bleeding edge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1948">&mdash; and I would like to emphasize "bleeding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">edge" &mdash; this is a particular version of Canary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">that is working right now. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">We encourage you to check it out. It is all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">on Github. It is all open right now. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1961"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: We started this as an experiment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">at the beginning to see what we could do. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">But the deeper we've gone, the more and more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">excited we've gotten, the more that we feel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">like this is sort on the cusp of something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">big with Web components. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">We really believe that with Web components, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">developers will be in order of magnitude more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1976">productive building more and better apps. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1976">So we pulled together a video that we think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1982">&mdash; that we hope will get you as excited about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1982">this future we are going towards as we are. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1993">[ Video playing. ] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1993">[ Music ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2049"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I'm curious, I'm looking at what you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2049">here. And I'm thinking back to MooTools and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">Jquery and how we got query selector all standardized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">out of that. And I'm wondering when you look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2060">at something like Angular that has a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2060">similar concepts, how this interplays. If </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2064">you see Angular in the future as being another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2064">sugar layer on top of something like polymer? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">Or if it Web components replaces Angular? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2070"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So we aren't from the Angular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">team. There might be a few folks from that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">team in the audience. They are aware of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2078">stuff. They have been playing around with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2078">Web components, providing feedback back to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">the standardization process as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">Again, one of the approaches with polymer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2085">that's really important is the layered approach. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2085">That means that other frameworks could take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">just one polyfill or all of them or what have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">you. So I imagine that, you know, maybe that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">something that other frameworks might want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">to experiment with, is building on top of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">those layers, if they want. I mean... </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2096"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Do you see the Web components specifications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">replacing the need for a lot of the &mdash; the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">Embers and the Angulars and things that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">popular now? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2106"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: I think that's the wrong </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">way of thinking about it. I think that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">Web components provides a lot of the utility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">belt. There is always that need for sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">that opinion to weave all that stuff together. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">And I think that frameworks will always have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">a place in this world because you are going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2120">to need it to help you build your apps. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2120"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2122"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: It brings you far but not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2122">all the way. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2125"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: I mean, It is extremely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2125">likely that they will have to use less code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2128">to do what they're doing, which is great for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2128">them, great for everyone else. But yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2132"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: I guess we got one in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">back there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2136"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Actually, I was going to ask about Angular, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2136">too, but I think it got answered. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">So my other question would be, then, is this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">something that you can &mdash; I mean, obviously </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2144">you're using Canary, you're using a very advanced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2144">build. Is this something that you expect we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">need to use only when we can tightly control </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">the environment in which it is running? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2153">I came in a little late. So backwards compatibility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2153">is my question. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2156"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Just to reiterate actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2156">the whole approach we're taking is building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2160">a layer of polyfills that sort of mocks out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2160">the future. Matt's using Canary so we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">show you real Shadow DOM being used. But this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">stuff should work across all modern browsers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">IE, Safari, Firefox, Chrome. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">And over time as they implement these standards, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2176">that sort of foundation layer will get thinner </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2176">and thinner. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2178"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So when you say "modern browsers," I assume </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2178">there will be a level that we will need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">test for and then &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2182"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: That's correct. One of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2185">goals here is to really live like we are in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2185">the future. And if you are staring in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">rearview mirror you aren't headed for trouble. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">We want to make sure we can actually assimilate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">the future in a high fidelity way. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2193"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: When you pulled up the X code bits from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2201">the Mozilla team, you said &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2201"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: X tags. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2204"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Sorry? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2204"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: X tags. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2206"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: X tags. You said it was significant because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">you are pulling that in from a third-party, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2209">you know, another vendor. Where's the actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2209">technical significance there if they're kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2215">of just doing the same thing? I didn't see, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2215">like, a threshold between polymer and X tags. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2223"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So, generally, if you wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2223">two libraries to play together previously, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2227">they had to either be built very specifically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2227">to do that and not introduced system-level </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">dependencies or they would collide and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">would just have to get lucky, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2238">The idea is with these things being encapsulated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2238">is that you don't have those system-level </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2242">dependencies and really the world inside of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2242">that element, which is what's using Mozilla's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">code, is completely separate from the world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">outside of that element. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2250">So you can mix and match these together things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2250">a lot easier without having to dealing with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">those collisions. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2253"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Before Web components, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2256">had to make everything in script. So you had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2256">conventions for what it means to be a component. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">Everyone's conventions have to align for them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">to be interoperable. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2263">With Web components, people can align their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2263">conventions on Web components, the standards, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2268">and then that makes them interoperable much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2268">more easily. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2270"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So did you have another library you pulled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">in to use those X tags? And they just co-exist </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">then because they are creating DOM elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">that are all happy together. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2279"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Theoretically, you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2279">just have it as an include. You can include </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2281">a component &mdash; in the future, you can include </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2281">a component from polymer's UI library. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2285">can include a component from X tags. You could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2285">intermingle the two or a third-party &mdash; or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">a framework that's yet to be created. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2290"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: It is all in that HTML </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2293">import. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2293"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So you lie an aspect that's above polymer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">and everything else that was significant in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">that respect to X tag versus your components? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2302"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Yep. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2302"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Gotcha. Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2306"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So I would confirm a simple question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2306">This polymer also works with Chrome Packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2314">Apps? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2314"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: Mm-hmm. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2315"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Does it work right now? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2315"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: Right now it does not work. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323">The way we did the polyfill violates the SP. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2323"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I see. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2326"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So Chrome apps is very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2326">specific about that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2330"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2330"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: But in the very near future, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2333">once the HTML Imports feature, which is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2333">thing that's loading things from across domains, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">is done natively, which is pretty soon, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">it will work. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2340"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: HTML imports is be &mdash; just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2340">started being implemented in Chrome. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2344">Audience member: (inaudible). </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2344">(Speaker off microphone.) </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2346"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So you can still use &mdash; as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2346">(saying name) was pointing out, you can use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">document.register even if you can't use some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">of these other pieces like HTML imports. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2355"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2355"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: We got one in the back. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2359"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yeah. You were talking about modern browsers. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2359">I was wondering if you could elaborate on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2367">mobile support. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2367"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So mobile, it is mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2372">Safari and Chrome, Chrome for Android. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2372"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: And Android browser? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2375"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Chrome for Android. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2375"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: Chrome for Android at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2380">moment is the only one we're testing out. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2380"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2383"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Again, it is very early </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2383">days. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2385"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Several years ago there was actually a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">similar technique that was to achieve the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2396">similar level of encapsulation, which is XML </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2396">plus XSLT. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2402">The essential of that is &mdash; the picture of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2402">that is essentially you will create a heavy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2410">element-focused, say, Web interface instead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2410">of having to take care of all the underlayers. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2420">What would you compare that to Web components? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2420"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: I think there's been a number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2425">of things that are similar to Web components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2425">in the past. None of them have really stuck </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2429">around for various reasons. There is the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2429">like XBL, which is still used actually in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2434">parts of Gecko. You've got things like the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2434">HTC stuff for Microsoft. You have got a bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">of other things that aims to solve all similar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">kinds of problems. Web components is now like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2446">an emerging set of specs that is &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2446"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: So the difference here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2450">is that you're using the same technologies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2450">you already use on the Web today. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2454"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2454"><span class="speakerName">Matthew McNulty</span>: You are using HTML, CSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2456">and JavaScript. There is actually nothing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2456">new here, whereas XSLT, I did a whole framework </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">in XSLT years ago. And that was &mdash; to debug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">that was one of the more insane things I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2466">ever done in my life. </span></p>
