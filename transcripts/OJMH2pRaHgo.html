<p><span class="line" data-startTime="205">And so our goal is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">increase visibility. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="209">Our industry is probably 10 or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">20% technical women, sometimes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">a little higher. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="214">We want to get to 50%. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="216">We want to match </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">the population. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="217">Products are just better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">when they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">built by diverse teams. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="220">Companies are better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="221">The world is better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="222">And that's part of our goal. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="224">I wanted to give a shout out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">to real progress that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">happening this year. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="228">Sheryl Sandberg, who is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">fabulous colleague, Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">alum now, leading Facebook with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">Mark, has really driven </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">the national and international </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">conversation up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="238">We need to be talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">about these things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="240">I don't know if people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">are familiar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">with the Maker series. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="335">Sometimes you're lucky &mdash; you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">know, there's symptoms of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">problem, and sometimes there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">roots of a problem. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="339">And I stumbled off across this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">when I met Geena Davis, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">famous Academy Award-winning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">actress. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="346">Geena was watching TV with her </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">children when they were young </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">and she just &mdash; as an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">actress, she could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">see that TV was biased. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="352">And she'd say in the industry, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">there's not enough women and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">girls on children's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">television. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="356">People would say, yes, of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">course, there's plenty, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">Dora, the "Scooby-Doo" girls, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">lots of people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="360">But then she thought, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">no, there's not. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="362">Let's measure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="363">You manage what you measure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="365">So she measured it together with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">USC Annenberg, and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">studies were showing &mdash; and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">they had grad students </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">counting by hand &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">it's actually three to one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">across all of children's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">television, the corpus of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">children's television of men </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">and boys versus girls. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="379">And so the girls aren't equally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">represented, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">see amazing things that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">wouldn't even notice, but how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">many women in the whole ocean </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">in the film "Nemo"? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">How many monsters or muppets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">were in "Sesame Street" who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">were girls until the '90s? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">That would be zero. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="396">"Nemo"? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">One. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="398">So we're not accurately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">depicting the world, and we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">skewing it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="401">So one of things we've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">lucky to do &mdash; and also, one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">more stat, the 80% stat. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="406">80% of the jobs that were held </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">by characters in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">television our children watched, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">were held by male </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">characters. </span></p>
