<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="0"><span class="speakerName">Female Speaker</span>: So now we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">going to shift, and we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">going to hear an amazing talk by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">a hardware lead at Google. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">Jean Wang has a PhD </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">in electrical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">engineering in photonics. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">She worked in the optical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">communications and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">then came to Google. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">She's the hardware lead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">on Google Glass. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">As a board member, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">have Google Glass. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">I love it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">It's so much more natural </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">than a phone. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">And now you get to hear about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">how she did this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">Thank you. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">[APPLAUSE] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="43"><span class="speakerName">Jean Wang</span>: Hi, everybody. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="45">Smile. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="48">So I'm very happy to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">here with you today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="51">I'd like to share with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">you my Glass journey. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="54">It's a three-part story that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">spans across multiple domains. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="58">And while it is yet unfinished, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">I hope you share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">my enthusiasm for what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">is yet to come. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="63">Before diving in, I'd actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">like to float this number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">briefly and plant it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">in your minds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="69">It has significance to me and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">the story, and in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">meantime, please feel free </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">to question the number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">base that I'm using. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="77">So, Glass, like many ideas, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">started as a blank canvas. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="82">As part of the initial team, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">we came into the project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">largely inexperienced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">in the field of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">head-mounted displays. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="87">Instead, we had the ability to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">divide and conquer through our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">ability to learn and adapt. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="92">While some of us focused on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">optics, like myself, others </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">worked on cameras, sensor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">systems, electronics. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="99">And so we also came in with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">fundamental belief that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">technology had ripened to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">point where we can make a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">significant impact and create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">something of significant use. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="108">And that has led us into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">discovery phase, to find out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">just what it was that could be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">done to basically minimize the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">barrier to information access, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">and to make us connect with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">each other in terms of accessing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">our social sphere. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="126">As part of the discovery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">process, we looked at existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">products in the mobile space </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">and wanted to really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">understand where it was that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">can make an impact in terms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">of form factor. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="135">For example, whether it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">bulky and had to fit into our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="137">pocket or carry around a bag </span><span class="line" data-startTime="137">for it; ease of access, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">whether we had to pull it out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">of our pocket or a bag to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">actually engage with it; and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">also ease of use, whether we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">were blocked when we were using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">the device, or whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">we could look straight ahead and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">talk with people and not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">be distracted. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="153">So to push on these pain points, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">we did a number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">technical experiments. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="158">Here's a helmet-mounted display </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">that did not allow us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">to be hands free </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">or wires free. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="164">And in the bottom, you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="164">here, is an early optical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">experiment to help us understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">the technical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">complexities in terms of how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">optics sizes actually impact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">the performance and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">the image quality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="176">So with these considerations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">in mind, we dived into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">selecting components that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">we could use to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">make a viable solution. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="186">So in the vast array of options, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">we looked at what it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">was we could just reuse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">and customize. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="191">Or was there something that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">had to invent for ourselves? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">So we played around with a bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">of pico projectors and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">projectors. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="197">We looked at optic components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">such as lenses and prisms as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">well as interface devices &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">touch pads, microphones, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">speakers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="205">And underpinning the whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">system was electrical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">components and board design. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="210">So in this huge selection of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">choices and huge array of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">options, how do we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">down-select? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">And so we filtered using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">two key criteria. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="220">One was power consumption, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">and a second was weight. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="224">So these two are basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">factors in enabling us to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">first, wear a system all day, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">and second, actually allow us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">to want to wear a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">system all day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="235">So we headed into the second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">phase of prototyping. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="241">Here are six example generations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">of glass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">prototypes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="247">Starting at the very top left, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">we took the lowest hanging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">fruit of simply putting mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">phones to the side of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">head, and a pico projector </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">shining directly into the eye </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">to provide the image. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="259">And so this was a bit bulky, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">as you can imagine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="262">It came in at 167 grams. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="264">And we wisely decided that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">could lighten the load by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">taking the mechanicals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">off the phone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="270">And that's our second proto </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">shown right up there in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">middle top. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="273">And so as you can see, over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">time, we shifted from using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">off-the-shelf components, such </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">as safety shields and frames, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">into 3D printing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">our own frame. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="282">And that's shown here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="282">in the third. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="284">And you can also see that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">migrated into making our own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">optical design and architecture, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">something we carry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">through today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="291">And as you gradually evolve to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">the very end, you see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">more and more we use customized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">components. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="297">And we look at making our own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">plastics and metals to get to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">where we are today, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">essentially the essence of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">what Glass needs to be. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="305">This provides the core, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">provides a very minimalistic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">system, that allows us to run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">around and be happy when we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">playing with the system. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="312">And in addition to prototyping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">with the hardware, Glass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">derives its use from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">easy to follow UI. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="320">And this is by definition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">actually easy to make. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="324">Along the way, we experimented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">with a number of different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">interaction concepts, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">example, head gestures. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="330">And that recent SNL skit was not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">too far from our previous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">truth, if you've seen it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="335">Also, we experimented with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">porting the keyword </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">functionality to the touchpad. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="339">But we found that was a bit too </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">complex, even when running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">in a predictive word mode. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="344">We also tuned the number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">of lines of text &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">the font, the size &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">to basically optimize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">for readability. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="352">So through all of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">things, we found that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">minimalizing and stripping down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">to the very core allowed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">for the best use case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">and experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="364">We also found that minor head </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">tilts and voice commands </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">allowed us for hands-free </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">experience, which is very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">important when we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">busy dancing or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">riding that roller coaster. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="377">On the flip side, having the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">touchpad and the camera button </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">allowed us for more quiet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">modes of interaction. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="383">So with the hardware and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">software solutions converging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">into a viable state, the team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">actually turned to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">question of production. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="394">It is possible to manually tweak </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">and baby one device, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">get it to be close to ideal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">in terms of cosmetics and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">functionality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="403">However, we'd like to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">Glass more broadly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="405">And so that, to us, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">quickly turns into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">the question of scale. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="409">How do we build not 1, 1,000, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">100,000, but upward towards a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">googol of devices? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">Layering in automation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">is key to this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="418">And that means that not only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">do we have to build Glass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">itself, but we have to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">infrastructure that builds Glass &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">this floor space, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">equipment, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">whole kit and caboodle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="432">And to add a bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">complexity, we'd like to honor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">individuality and human </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">preferences. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="438">And that to us, has meant color </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">options, and that leads </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">to color complexity. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="445">How do we make sure that on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">the device itself, part to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">part, the colors match? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">And how do we make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">sure that between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">devices the colors match? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">So production requires the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">solutions to all of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">questions and beyond. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="459">Through these three phases of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">discovery, prototyping, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="464">production, I have found that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="464">Glass is both an innovation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">and a reinvention. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="470">By integrating highly compact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">and new components, we've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">able to extend far beyond nickel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">head-mounted displays, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">beyond the last couple decades </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">of individualized movie </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">players, game consoles, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">and aircraft systems. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="485">On other hand, I think that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">Glass is a way in which we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">examine and develop new fields </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">that we can push beyond and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">learn to be better connected to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">each other as well as share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">perspective and have access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">to information. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="500">And all of this will allow us to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">better empathize as people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">and sympathize. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="506">So coming back to that number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">at the very beginning. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="509">It's been exactly, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">of today, 1,111 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">days since I joined. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="514">And this is a picture I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">would not be able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">take without Glass. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="518">I am paragliding over Coronet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">Peak, New Zealand. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="521">And just by looking at it, I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">recall what it was like to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">soar with the birds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">and to take in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">beauty of the landscape. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="529">I have often been asked what the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">a-ha moments have been in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">the project thus far. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="532">And while I have a few, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">am more excited about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">what is yet to come. </span></p>
