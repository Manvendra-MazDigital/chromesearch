<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1">What is PageSpeed Service and how does it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1">work? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">Web pages today contain a lot more than HTML. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="4">They combine stylesheets, images, videos, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">Javascript files and other components to give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">the rich interactive experience we now expect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">on the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="16">This means however that to display a web page, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">a browser has to make several HTTP requests, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">as many as 43 requests for the average web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">page, to fetch all these resources from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">server hosting your site. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="28">Many such network requests to fetch files </span><span class="line" data-startTime="28">one after another increases wait time and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">slows down the page. Slow web pages can make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">visitors to your site less engaged and even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">frustrated, leading to lower conversion and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">lost revenue. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="43">Google PageSpeed Service is an online service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">you can use to automatically speed up your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">website. It rewrites web pages dynamically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">to apply several performance-improving practices, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">and then serves the optimized pages via Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">servers to reduce page load time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="59">When you first setup PageSpeed Service for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">your site, you’ll be guided to change its </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">DNS entry so that your domain name points </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">to PageSpeed servers. Once completed, PageSpeed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">servers will serve your web pages and intelligently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">cache their resources to serve them to users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">faster. They’ll also fetch newer content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">from your original host server so that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">latest version of your website is always served </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">to users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="84">PageSpeed servers are located in Google operated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">datacenters distributed around the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="89">So your site will benefit from the speed, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">efficiency and security of the same infrastructure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">that powers all of Google. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="97">PageSpeed rewriters use a combination of techniques </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">to optimize web pages. One of them is to reduce </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">the number and size of the resources to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">fetched. PageSpeed Service rewrites web pages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">to merge and compress Javascript, stylesheet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">and image files, and to parallelize the download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">of these files wherever possible. This means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">fewer HTTP requests and lower round-trip times, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">so your web page gets delivered to the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">faster. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="123">Another technique is to reduce the perceived </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">page load time. This is the minimum time that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">users have to wait before they can view the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">page. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="131">The typical web page today is long and has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">many visual elements. But only a small portion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">of the page is initially visible in the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">once the page has loaded. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="141">PageSpeed Service can rewrite a web page so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">that the parts of the page that users expect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">to see first get downloaded first. This means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">users can engage with your site right away, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">without having to wait for the full page to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">load. The rewriters can also cache parts of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">the page that don’t change frequently so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">they get delivered to the browser quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">on future visits to your site. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="163">This combination of advanced rewriter technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">and global serving infrastructure can dramatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">reduce the load time of your web pages, often </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">by as much as 40%. Faster web pages improve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">the experience of visitors to your site and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">so can increase both traffic and customer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">conversion. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="181">So get started with PageSpeed Service today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">and discover how fast your websites can be! </span></p>
