<h1>Google I/O 2012 &mdash; The Web Can Do That!?</h1>

<h2>Eric Bidelman</h2>

<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/X_ek1wSe66o">youtu.be/X_ek1wSe66o</a><div id="transcript"><p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1"><span class="speakerName">Eric Bidelman</span>: All right. Are we ready? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1">Android is processing my photo. Hold on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1">All right. Guys, I really want to thank you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1">for coming to my session. This is The Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">Can Do That, in case you've misplaced what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">session you should be in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="7">Apparently none of you want to get free Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">hardware downstairs, so I do really appreciate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="11">your time for the next hour. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="11">This is going to be adventures into HTML5. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="17">Just so you know who you're talking to up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">here, my name is Eric Bidelman and I work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">on the Google Chrome team. I'm an advocate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">for Chrome team, I teach developers HTML5, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="28">help them use it by writing tutorials. Of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="28">course, if you want to contact me there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">Google+, there's the Twitter and there's also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">a blog that I don't write to very often, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">it does have some interesting things I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">on it. So that's who is up on stage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="43">I get this a lot. People are really skeptical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">about HTML5 still and so they don't know what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">possible. And so part of my job is to come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">up here and teach you guys and you too, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">folks at home, what is possible on the Web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="54">So today's talk is that the agenda is there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">going to be no agenda whatsoever. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="59">So I'm going to sort of highlight really cool, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">interesting use cases that HTML5 can now solve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">that you probably didn't know were possible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">on the Web today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="68">Things that you probably need to build a real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">world application on the Web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="72">So a little bit of convention about this slide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">deck. This is a living, breathing slide deck. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="78">I'm doing something a little bit different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">with this. You will see in the top right corner </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">there's a legend and there's a radar, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">that signifies that stuff is on the radar. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="86">Keep it on your radar, it's still pretty new, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">it's changing quickly. I can actually make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">CORs requests, cross origin resource requests, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">[indiscernible] XHRs, to the WebKit issue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">tractor, which is really nice. So as soon </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">as a bug is fixed, I know it's fixed, I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">mark them, denote it with this little bug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">guy as it gets crossed off. So you kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">know when you go back to this slide at greater@html5.com. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="108">It's not up right now. I'll post it after </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">the slides. But there are spec links and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">know the stuff is up to date. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="115">Okay. So without further adieu let's jump </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">into the number one main awesome, sweet thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">that the Web can do. The first is that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">have CSS for Web apps. And you're probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">like whoa &mdash; yeah, Mythbuster style. You're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">probably like, whoa, Eric, we've had CSS for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">a long time. What's up with that? Well, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">have. We had a lot of great stuff in CSS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="134">We have floats and absolute positioning and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">tables and all this stuff kind of working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">together. The real problem with that is it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">was all designed in times of websites, not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">Web apps. So if you want to do complex Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">layout it's really, really hard until now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="147">So I'm calling 2012 sort of the rise of CSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">for Web apps, and that's because the working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">groups have proposed a number, a slew of new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">stuff that we can play with eventually as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">Web developers. Regions for things like flowing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">and magazine type layout and design. Flexbox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">layout, which I will talk about, it's one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">of my particular favorites, being able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">easily position things on the page in a flexible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">manner. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="173">Grid layouts and hierarchies in ASCII and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">CSS so you can define where things show up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">on a page. It makes sense. If you're building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">something on top of CSS you need engines and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">different mechanisms to do that for Web apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="186">And then there's the bells and whistles, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">the hierarchies, there's the folders and effects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">and other really cool stuff coming down the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">pipeline. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="193">CSS variables. If you guys attended the Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">component session earlier, that stuff is finally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">coming to CSS. You can finally use variables </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">in CSS. It's not that exciting, but it's super </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">exciting as a Web developer that you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">have to use a Web processor anymore. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="208">So why am I picking on Flexbox out of all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">this new stuff? Flexbox is really great for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">Web layout design and it's really going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">solve and is solving the sort of common use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">cases of a Web app. So that Holy Grail layout, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">that header, that footer, that three-column </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">tiered system, very hard to do with, notoriously </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">hard to do with CSS today. Very easy with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">Flexbox. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="230">And so the way Flexbox works is that there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">a new display property. So I can tell a container </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">to be a Flexbox container and I'm doing also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">something in this slide deck, nobody is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">to catch me on vendor prefixes. I'm using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">sort of a compile type syntax, a mix-in syntax </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">to denote that any time you see a + for CSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">that means vendor prefixes are involved. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="249">I can tell, for instance, this right container </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">to be a Flexbox container with display vendor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">prefix flex. And we can do things like center </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">content horizontally and vertically super </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">easy. With three lines of CSS we can do this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">now. We don't have to use negative margins </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">or JavaScript. So along my main access here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">&mdash; this is a little bit of Flexbox terminology. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="270">In my cross origin access, I can justify content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">to the center, I can flex it to the start, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">I can say everything be adjusted far to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">right. And I can also align those items in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">that cross access, so I can align items to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">the center, I can allow them to the bottom. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="284">I can do things like stretch to take up the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">available content of your parent container. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="289">Very, very handy with layout. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="293">And I can do also things like distribute yourself </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">evenly in a container. Take up the available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">space and put an even distribution of white </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">space around yourself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="306">Another cool thing about Flexbox is that it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">completely takes away the sort of mapping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">of your source to how things are rendered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">on the page. So typically what happens is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">that you define your A, your B and your C </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">div. These are just three divs inside of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">flex container. And that's how I've weighted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">out my markups, right? I have an A, B and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">C in my markup. But maybe I don't want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">render A, B and C in that order, and I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">do that through different properties of Flexbox. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="327">I have this flex direction property, so again </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">vendor prefix. So right now we're flexing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">in a row, but I can choose to change the order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">of that row. I can reverse the order of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">row using row reverse. I can tell these items </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">to be in a column so A, B and C are not in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">a row now, but they can be rendered in a column. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="348">And then using the order property I can sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">of change the order depending on what value </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">I set here. So by default these are all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">same order as they're laid out in markup, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">but I can tell the second div to come before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">A. So this is independent of how I've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">my markup out, just rendering it different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">next to the page using the orientation and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">direction properties of Flexbox. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="366">I can also tell it to come after everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="372">But another really cool thing that Flexbox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">solves is sort of this type of use case where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">you have the same height columns. So in order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">to do same height columns &mdash; this is a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">example of floating three divs across the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">page. But if I want to do something like make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">these even, right, I have a really awesome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">UI, I can do that with a little bit of JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">where I can set these and get the computed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">style of the content and know exactly how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">tall they should be. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="398">But what happens if my UI is being rendered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">through JSON, I'm porting in an RSS feed or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">something, and &mdash; my content is dynamic. As </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">soon as that happens, I put a little bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">content, my columns are now out of sync, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">have to recalculate, I have to touch JavaScript, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">I have to set properties in CSS. It just feels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">super, super icky. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="418">So the way Flexbox solves that is through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">its bread and butter, flexibility. So it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">really nice. I can tell things to take up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">the available amount of the parent container. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="428">In this case all of these items, A, B, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="428">C, are equally distributed in the Flexbox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">container. But I don't have to do that. I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">can tell the second difference to be two times </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">greater, grow to be two times as big as your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">siblings or three times as big or four times </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">as big. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="442">I can also tell it to shrink. So A and C will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">be equal size with a flex property of one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">and then B is going to be a negative flex </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">property. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="451">So it's really handy when it comes to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">Holy Grail layout. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="454">So I want to show you an example of this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="458">This is a live page. Think of this as that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">Holy Grail layout, that header, footer, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">three column in the center. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="463">The first thing you will notice is this whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">thing, maybe not the resolution, but the whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">thing is centered vertically and horizontally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">in my page with three lines of CSS, right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">the alignment and justification there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="475">Next thing to happen on this page is a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">sweet navigation bar. You will notice that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">that last button up there has more content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">than the rest of my buttons, but that's okay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="485">We can tell the Flexbox items to grow and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">shrink. So all my buttons are exactly the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">same size. I didn't set anything in CSS, particularly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">the widths of those buttons, it's just flexing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">to take up the available space of that complete </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">Web app. But if I add more, all of these buttons </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">will continue to flex and be of equal weight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">and size and distributed evenly. It's great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">for navigation, it's great for UI. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="504">We can also use some CSS transitions on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">flex property so I can do really cool UI flex </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">here, little zippies here, so these are just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">Flexbox items within a Flexbox container with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">the column orientation. And with the CSS hover </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">I can tell them to grow with the flex property </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">to grow to be two times or three times greater </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">than rest. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="525">My center content in the center of the article </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">content I can use transforms to do things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">with vertical alignment there on the side, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">my navigation on my side. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="534">If I wanted to I could combine the media queries, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">and you remember I could independently order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">my source and how things are presented using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="543">that order property. So that combined media </span><span class="line" data-startTime="543">source may be in my mobile UI. I have something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">that is different. If I scale this down to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">mobile UI, notice in the case of my desktop, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">the article is in the center. That's my main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">content, that's what users should be seeing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">but when I scale on to mobile maybe the articles </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">should come before that navigation element, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">that zippy on the side. So I can do that with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">that ordering orientation property, very handy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">when combined with media queries. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="567">So that's CSS Flexbox. And that's the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">one. There is an older Flexbox if you've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">following this stuff closely. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="582">That's actually available in a number of browsers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">right now. So WebKit, Chrome. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="585">IE 10 will have the new Flexbox as well. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">you can expect to use this relatively soon. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="590">All right. Number two amazing thing is dynamic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">CSS. By dynamic CSS I actually mean &mdash; that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">was confirmed too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="598">I actually mean the calc function. If you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="601">attended the session earlier today on Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="601">components, they have CSS variables coming. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="605">But we actually have the ability to do similar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">things now with the calc function. It's been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">around in Firefox for a long time, just came </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">to WebKit very recently. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="614">What I have here is a live example of something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">that's in the Flexbox specification. So I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">basically have a bunch of divs. I have a div </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">within a div within a div, and I put a border </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">radius of 50% on this div, so that's what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">creating the circles. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="629">I've specified the parent circle container </span><span class="line" data-startTime="629">to be 300 wide and 300 tall. What's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">nice about this is I can use the CSS calc </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">function, so again vendor prefix, to calculate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">each of these inner divs to be 100% minus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">4 EM. Each of these children divs is 4 EM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">smaller than its parent container and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">producing sort of this target effect. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="652">What's really neat about this is you combine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">it with what we just talked about, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">Flexbox, and so that's what's doing the alignment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">of the center and justifying the content to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">the center. So that vertical center, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">horizontal center with three lines of CSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">now, combined with the calc function you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">do something like this, which you haven't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">been able to do before without a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">of JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="670">Really awesome. This stuff now can work together </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">really easily with a lot of new CSS stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="675">And support is actually really good for this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">as you can see by this slide. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="681">So that's what's happening with CSS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="681">Number three amazing, awesome thing that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">Web can do is data binding. And you're like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">what? The web can't do data binding. Oh, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="691">it can. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="691">This is actually old hat for JavaScript frameworks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="695">If you use your framework like Angular JS, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">for example, one of my favorites at the moment, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">data binding looks like this. This is how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">they define a template in Angular. It's just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">HTML, which is really, really nice. I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">have to learn a new API or markup. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="711">If I want to do one-way data binding I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="711">have an input, I can change the input, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">as I change that my template is being re-rendered. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="717">I'm just re-rendering the value of the input </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">as it changes. And that's done through sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">of Angular's magic. My model in this case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="726">is this val. That's what I'm calling the model. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="726">And as I change the input, val is being re-rendered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="731">to the template. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="731">So that's one-way data binding use a JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">framework. But we can actually do a neat little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">trick that I kind of discovered, which I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="740">calling it poor man's data binding, and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="740">using data attributes, HTML data attributes. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="745">So we don't need a framework to do one-way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">data binding. So the way this works is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">you have a data attribute. That's your data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">model. That's where you're going to be storing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">your values. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="753">And then a lot of people don't know, but there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">this really awesome, amazing attribute that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">you can use to pull out values from the DOM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">and use those values in CSS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="761">So that's how we'll get the data from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">data model. Then our view from this case, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">what we're rendering this data to, is generated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">content. So before and after pseudo elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">and generating that model to those elements. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="776">And so we don't have a JavaScript framework </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">to work for us in this case so we have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="779">actually hook up Web event listeners to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="779">this and watch for the changes. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="785">So what you get back with the poor man's data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">binding is exactly the same thing. So I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="789">have an input, and as I change that input, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="789">I can re-render that to my template, my pseudo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">elements, on the fly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="795">So a small amount of code to do this. I set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">up an event change event on my input. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">then as that input changes, the user changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">it, I'm sending a data attribute using the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">data set object. So data-values is my thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">that I'm changing to the new value. And the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">really cool part of this is that I'm using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">before and after pseudo selectors for this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="816">So I'm using that attribute method to rip </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">out that data element, that data attribute, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">from the DOM, dividing it by the max attribute, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">in this case 100. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="825">So you get the exact same thing as the Angular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">JS case. I don't need a framework to do the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">&mdash; this type of one-way data binding. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="833">You can do the exact same thing with an extra </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">span or DOM node and just render the inner </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">text of that. That's cool. This is a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">cooler in my opinion and it illustrates that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">we can do this now in HTML5. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="842">But we can also use something better, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">is the dataless element, something new to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">WebKit, and Opera has had this for a slew </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">of time. This is sort of a semantic way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">do one-way data binding. So in this case your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">data model is actually defined in markup. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="856">You have data list element, you can reference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">it by an ID, so the browser's out, and each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">option is sort of the values of this data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">list. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="866">And what we bind to in this case is an input </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">element, so we reference it by the list attribute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">of ID and so we're finding this data list </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">&mdash; these values to this input element. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">it's a great way to do things like auto complete. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="879">So I have an example of that in here. I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">the list of browsers. When I click on this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">I get the values from that data list. We bound </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">that data to this input. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="888">If I do things like &mdash; if I start typing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">just as you expect I have auto complete behavior. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="896">That's super handy. That's the HTML5 way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="896">do one-way data binding. You actually saw </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">it in that blue column example, you saw me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">use this data attribute trick as well to render </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">out the heights of those columns as they were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">changing when I clicked on them. And both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">of these methods for data binding are actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">all supported on all the bottom browsers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">which is really, really sweet. But if you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">doing something simple like I just showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="918">you, you can do one-way data binding just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="918">with HTML, just on the Web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="923">How many people think HTML can access a file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">system? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">It's hard to see up here, we have some believers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="927">We have a lot of naysayers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="933">It's cool. This one is totally confirmed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="933">It's confirmed because I got really excited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="938">about this one. I got so excited that I wrote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="938">a book. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="941">[Laughter] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="941"><span class="speakerName">Eric Bidelman</span>: Shameless plug, I know. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="944">What we have now in HTML5 is a file system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">API. This is something that you can do very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">easily in a native app. You can read and write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">folders and persist data. That's very common. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="955">We should be able to do this on the Web as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">well and we can do that with the file system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="959">So there's a new property on the window method </span><span class="line" data-startTime="963">called request file system, and this is vendor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="963">prefixes alluded to by this underline here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="968">You can open the file system and read and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="968">write files and folders. That's really huge. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="973">The security behind this is exactly like the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="973">other offline storage API. So it's on a per-origin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="978">basis. You can't read and write to somebody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="978">else's Web app and you certainly can't come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">out of the browser and write to somebody's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">My Pictures folder or the system's My Documents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">folder. It's all on a per-origin for your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">Web app. But it's super powerful. And the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="992">real benefit of this is to get around issues </span><span class="line" data-startTime="992">that something like App Cache does. So if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">you've used App Cache, it's kind of clunky, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">it's hard to use. With the file system API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">we can easily and dynamically cache individual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">files and folders very quickly. Store them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1006">in folders, arrange them in a hierarchy, nuke </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1006">that if we need to. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1010">So as a quick example of caching an image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1010">file, for instance, just a png file, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">going to use a friend, XMLhtpp request, pull </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">that guy down, and we're not pulling it as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">a streamer, but we're pulling it as an array </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">buffer, so we'll set the response type and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">we're just going to get a raw byte array back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">from that image. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1028">And we get the response and we'll open the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">file system using WebKit file request file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">system, give it a store, so maybe we'll store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">a megabyte worth of data in this. We'll use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1040">the file system's root directory, just the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1040">root entry of my file system, and we'll call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">it image.png, we'll create it if it doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">exist using this param here. We'll get back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1052">a file entry, we'll then write that response </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1052">of the XHR out to the file system and save </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">that data. So this is just creating a file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">writer object. We can set up events for when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1062">the write has ended, if there's any errors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1062">that happened. And the important part is this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">guy right here, this writer.write. We're gonna </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">write out that data, the response of the XHR, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">create a new blog from the response and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">going to be saved. The image is gonna be saved </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1075">locally to our Web app and we can use that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1075">as if it were a local resource to our Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1079">app. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1079">So that's the final product. You can see there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1086">a lot of callbacks that are involved here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1086">I have at least one, two, three, four &mdash; four </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">to five levels of sort of callback &mdash; callback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">spaghetti that's happening here. Callbacks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1097">are hard. People don't like to deal with them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1097">This is a famous quote that I just said. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1103">[Laughter] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1103"><span class="speakerName">Eric Bidelman</span>: Actually, I wanted to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1104">it simpler for developers. Again, I'm really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1104">passionate about this API. It's very powerful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1109">So I wrote this library called filer.js. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1109">can check out the GitHub URL there. But essentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">what it is is a library that wraps common </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">UNIX commands on top of the file system API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1119">calls. So we have things like LS and CD and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1119">copy and the things that you know from interface </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1124">that make it super easy to use this API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1124">If I want to copy a file, for instance, filer.copy, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">the file path you want to copy to and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">renaming it as well. So super handy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1137">It makes the whole thing much more approachable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">if you're familiar with this sort of development. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1139">Let's see a demo of this guy. So this is called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">the file system API playground. Essentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">what this is is a Web app that sits on top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">of the file system API. So right now I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">have anything in this guy, but you can easily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">use HTML5 Dragon drop to add some files, boom, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">I can add some text files. I can open these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">files, right, so there's this sort of notion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">of using this &mdash; this resource locally with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">referencing it via URL. Can use that within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1173">my Web app. Can also read this file and preview </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1173">it if I wanted to using the file reader API, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">and get some metadata such as the date and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">last modified times. Can use filer.js and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">API to rename the file. The best part about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">this is I've actually cached these resources, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">so if I refresh this page, my Web app, right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">has those values and those resources saved </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1194">in them, so all the changes I made are being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1194">persisted, which is really awesome. Can create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1199">files and folders. Create a folder using the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1199">API. You can drill into it. Import some data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1207">here. Luckily it's after lunch so, you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1207">don't have to get too hungry. But this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1212">really great. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1212">I mean, this is native stuff, but it's on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1215">the Web. We can write and read files and folders </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1215">now using the file system API. So you're probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1223">asking yourself this: This is great, but if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1223">it's only in Chrome, like why am I going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">use it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">Then I'm like, oh, yeah. So again, I really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1234">like this API, you guys, so I decided to implement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1234">a polyfill stream library that sits on top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1239">of index DB that then you can use in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1239">Web app to have basically the file system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1243">API in browsers that support index DB. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1243">same Web app, right? Same Web app running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">in Chrome is running in FireFox. And I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">add files and folders to this guy, maybe &mdash; it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1256">a nightly build, so I don't know &mdash; there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1256">we go. And if I refresh this up, those files </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">that I just wrote to the Web app are preserved. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">So that library is called IDBfilesystem.js. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1272">And if you're interested in this API, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">file system API, check it out, it basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1277">means that we can now use this API in a relatively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1277">performant way in the browsers that do support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1282">index DB. Super Stoked about it. Hope you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1282">guys get Stoked about it, too. Files and folders, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">the Web can do that. All right, Number 5. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1287">This one looks suspicious. Totally is busted. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1294">Just making sure you guys are paying attention. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1294">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1298"><span class="speakerName">Eric Bidelman</span>: The real Number 5 is serverless </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1298">downloads. So we got data in the file system, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1304">we're storing data in our Web app &mdash; where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1304">is my clicker? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">What happens when you want to get data back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">out of your Web app, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">So for a long time, if you wanted to download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">a file and trick the browser into downloading </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">a file from the response of your server, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">would have had to do something like this: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1323">You would send a content disposition header </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1323">as an attachment, give it a file name, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1327">essentially what this did was when the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1327">hit this response, the browser would sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1331">of &mdash; it would trick it into downloading a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1331">file and it would invoke the browser's download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1335">manager. What we have now is a lot of people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1335">are writing thick clients, right? Maybe there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1341">no server involved whatsoever, so how do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1341">do this? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">How do you send a header if you don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">a server? It's impossible. So smart folks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">in the Web community were like, hey, we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">solve this, we've got this great idea, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1352">make an attribute, we'll call it "download". </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1352">That makes a lot of sense. And what download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">does is you can use with an anchor tag for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">instance, and so what happens is &mdash; normally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1362">what happens is if you &mdash; if a user clicks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1362">on this H ref to this logo.png, what happens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">is the browser will open that image in a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">tab and you can view the image. That's cool. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">But what happens if you have download specified, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">this attribute, and you can give it the name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">of the file you want to download as, is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">it's going to trick the browser into doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">the exact same thing as the content disposition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">header, and then you can download that file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1384">instead of navigating to that resource. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1384">if none of that makes any sense to you, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1391">have an epic novel creator here, and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1391">is just a text area that I'm typing into, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1397">so let me bring this up a little bit. So just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1397">to show you that I'm typing live. I'm just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1405">typing in this. I'm composing my epic novel. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1405">And then I want to have the user save what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1409">they've just done, so I can do that using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1409">the download attribute. When I click this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">button, I'm going to create a txt file, a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">text file in JavaScript using the block builder </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1419">API. Create a dynamic link in JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1419">Attach that download attribute as my file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">.txt as its value. When I click that, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">browser is not going to open that resource, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1432">it's actually going to download the file that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1432">I just created in JavaScript, and if I open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1437">this, it's going to be native to my system, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1437">and as you can see, the text content that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1441">I just pulled out from that text area has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1441">been saved. I've just downloaded a file in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">JavaScript, all clientside, no servers. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">pretty sweet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1454">So we have the ability to save data in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1454">file system, we have the ability to get it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1458">back out using the down attribute. What about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1458">getting data in between apps? Now, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1465">this thing called Web intense, and I encourage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1465">you to go to Paul Kinlan and James' session </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">later in the week. But one way to officially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">transfer data is rocketships, of course. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">another way is with post message. And in order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">to describe this and set this up for you guys, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">I want to take you down sort of memory lane </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">of post message. Post message started off </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1485">as a way to communicate with a Webworker or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1485">a window object, right? You could send a string. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1490">You could send "hello world" to a worker, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1490">and then it could, I don't know, do something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1494">interesting with that. But what happened is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1494">hey, people are gonna &mdash; the browsers are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">like &mdash; developers got smart, they were like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">let's just send JSON stringify data. So they'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1503">stringify some JSON, and pass some commands </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1503">in and out of worker or to a window object. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1509">So it was totally cool, but then the browsers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1509">were like, hey, like, we can do better, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">just do that for them, just not have the ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">to stringify JSON, but let's just do it under </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1519">the hood, so what happens is the browser would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1519">JSON stringify and JSON parse this message </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1524">out, so that was cool. That got us one step </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1524">further. Sort of this post message evolution, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1530">but then the third step that came along was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1530">the ability to send more complex data, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">You just saw me send a file &mdash; create a file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">in JavaScript. Why can't I send a file into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1539">a Web worker and do something interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1539">with it, or a Web GL texter as an array buffer? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1543">All right, we have binary data in &mdash; on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1543">Web now; we should be able to do interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1548">things with it. So eventually , the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1548">is like, hey, we'll open this up, we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1550">to use this structured cloning algorithm to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1550">pass a blob, a file into the Web worker and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">process it. Or you can send an array buffer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">so this is really, really cool, right? And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1560">a lot of the modern browsers support this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1560">You can send a massive, you know, data set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">into a Web worker. Do some computation on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">it in this sort of multi-thread environment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1570">and then get it back out and do something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1570">interesting. So the real problem with this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1573">though, is that these are all &mdash; all the methods </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1573">I just covered are copies, so that becomes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">very inefficient when you're copying and sending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">amounts of data in and out of a Web worker. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1582">It's kind of pointless to have this awesome, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1582">you know, multi-threaded Web worker doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1586">its thing, but if you can't get data in and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1586">out very quickly, then it defeats the purpose. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1590">So of course I wouldn't be up here if we can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">do better, and we can do better, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1596">comes via transferable objects. Transferable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1596">objects are something that the Web GL community </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">thought up because they need this ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">to do processing on large amounts of data. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">And so you can see this guy is using your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">old friend, but it has different semantics, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1609">and that's why this method is prefixed with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1609">WebKit post message. This is something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1614">is supported in Chrome. So what happens with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1614">the new post message is that it's a zero copy, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1621">so if you're familiar with like C++ or C, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1621">think of it as a pass-by reference rather </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1626">than a pass-by value. And so the ownership </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1626">of this data is actually transferred from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1631">your main app to the worker or window context </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1631">that you're posting to. And so what happens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">is that this becomes actually really, really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">efficient, up to 50 times faster. I measured </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">this in Chrome 17. So Chrome 17, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">that is sort of long gone now, but it could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">even be faster. I don't know. But the important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">point of this graph are these last two columns </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1651">here. In Chrome 17 the difference between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1651">the regular post message, which is on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">left, the middle one, and the right, is orders </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">and orders of magnitude. This is a logarithmic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">scale, keep in mind. Faster. So basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">what I did in this test was I sent a 32 megabyte </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1665">file into a Web worker. I didn't do any processing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1665">on that file, and then I sent it right back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1670">just to see how fast that was. I measured </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1670">that. And you can see the rate &mdash; the round </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">trip simulated rate of that is super, super </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">fast. So this is really sweet for things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1681">physics simulations and again Web GL, gaming. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1681">I have an example of this, and unfortunately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1686">this is not super sexy to demo, but this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1686">my awesome sexy demo for transferable object. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1694">This page has basically set up a Web worker. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1694">I got a worker ready to be post messaged to, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">and when I hit this run button, it's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">to use that new WebKit post message to send </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">data into Web worker. I think we're sending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">&mdash; we're sending a 32 megabyte array buffer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">so this 32 megabyte file into a web worker, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">and then sending that right back, seeing how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1715">fast that is. So I'll hit this, ready? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1715">Boom, boom, boom, boom. 6 milliseconds. 5,000 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">megabytes a second simulated rate, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">I mean, that is kind of ridiculous, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1727">That's awesome. That's awesome for sending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1727">large amounts of data. And that's a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1731">data. 32 megabytes is no joke. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1731">Pop up a full screen here. Just to show you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1739">the difference &mdash; I'm not picking on any browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1739">in particular &mdash; but a browser that doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1744">support transferable object, you can actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1744">noticeably see the difference here. Let me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1749">zoom in. So when I hit this, run, boom, boom. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1749">So, not only do the numbers speak for themselves, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1758">157 as opposed to 5,000 megabytes a second, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1758">you can actually see the delay, right, visually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">the delay that it takes for this Web app to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">make that round trip request. So significant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">difference using transferable objects and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">performance. In my opinion this is something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1774">that, you know, the Web path form and workers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1774">in window and post message should have had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">available in the first place, but this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">sort of a common thing in the Web, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1782">We're sort of incrementally improving on what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1782">we already had, making it better and better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">and better every time. This one's only in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">Chrome, again something that should be in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">every browser. Efficiency is something we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">love in the Web. How many people think the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">Web can access native hardware? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">Not using phone gap or something like that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">Okay. Got some believers. I love it. You guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">know this is when it's going to be confirmed. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1805">It's confirmed. It's totally confirmed. What </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1805">I mean by accessing hardware is device APIs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1810">There's a whole working group dedicated to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1810">figuring this stuff out now. And what I mean </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">by devices are things like geolocation and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">accessing the accelerometer of this laptop, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">using web GL to access the GPU, right, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">graphics processor unit of the laptop, using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1826">a very high level JavaScript API. I just showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1826">you the file system API. We can read and write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">folders and files on the Web now. Whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">I'm online or offline, network connectivity, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">all via JavaScript, battery API, game pad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">API, all super possible. Web RTC and Web audio, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1844">I want to briefly mention on. There's two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1844">dedicated sessions to these two topics, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1848">they're very &mdash; they're noteworthy and very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1848">complex and they should have a dedicated session. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1853">Being able to access voice and video on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1853">Web is sort of this coveted grail, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1858">I mean, we've wanted to access the microphone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1858">for a long time or get camera for a long time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">but you've needed a plug in to do this, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">this is one example of being able to sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1867">of &mdash; the first step along this path to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1867">that, with one attribute, this x WebKit speech </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1872">attribute, we can annotate an input, and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1872">browser is going to annotate it with this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1876">little microphone input. Instead of typing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1876">in this Web app, it can actually interact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1880">with the microphone in this Web app. "I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1880">some coffee". All right. It worked. Sometimes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1888">it doesn't. Or you get some weird rendition. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1888">But this is really great. A different way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1893">to interact with my Web app. I don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1893">much of an API to play with, right? It's sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1897">of happening under the hood. But I'm accessing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1897">the microphone of this laptop using one attribute. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1905">So what we have now is something way better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1905">We have camera and microphone access via Get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1910">User Media. Get User Media is coming out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1910">the Web RTC project, navigator dot &mdash; either </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1915">Get User Media or the prefix version. Also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1915">Christian from FireFox tells me this is coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1921">to FireFox and nightly builds, so that should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1921">be on there as well. To the camera, the device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1928">and the microphone device. With this call, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1928">I can specify that I want audio access, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1932">want video access, and what I'm going to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1932">back is a stream object representing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1937">data that I get from both devices. And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1937">what's really cool is again I'm using different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1942">parts of the platform that have already existed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1942">for a long time. I'm using a video element. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1946">HTML video is one of the core features of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1946">HTML5 when it first came out. Instead of setting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">the video source to, you know, a movie file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">or an OVG file, I'm setting it to a blob URL </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1960">created from the data I get from the camera. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1960">So instead of a file, I'm just sending the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">camera data and the microphone data directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">into this video tag, so that's what's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">to give us the ability to render live to video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">tag. So a little demo. There's a lot of really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1973">cool demos people created using Get User Media </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1973">and the ability to access the camera. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1977">This is my demo. I do trust this app. I made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">it. I wrote it. So I'm gonna &mdash; I can't see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1983">at the top. I'm going to allow access. We'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1983">create a video element in JavaScript, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">there we go. My first stage &mdash; you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">behind &mdash; so this is great, no plug-ins, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1991">This is just JavaScript on the Web, but again </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1991">I can combine this with different parts of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1996">the Web platform, so I can use CSS filters </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1996">in real time to overlay this video with effects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">like gray scale. How about a blur effect in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">real time? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">That's pretty &mdash; that is pretty trippy. Version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">effects, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2009">Just using CSS, applying to this video, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2009">can do all that and still really awesome, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2013">looks great. I can combine it with a canvas, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2013">right, do a photo booth effect. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2016">[chuckling] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2016"><span class="speakerName">Eric Bidelman</span>: All right. That's enough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2016">of that. One of my favorites, though, is this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2016">one called the Web cam toy, so I'll grant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">access to this. Okay, that uses my camera. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">This is not going to use CSS filters, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2039">it's going to use the power of camera, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2039">power of Web GL, right?

Oh, yeah, 3D. This is after </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2073">you've had a few drinks at the party tonight. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2080">Just amazing things.

Support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2092">for this is actually really good. Opera just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2092">released Opera 12; it has this.

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">Play it, that's cool, we don't need a plug-in, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">but what if you want to do something like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2140">[Music Playing] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">What if you want to visualize that data in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">real time, get the frequency analysis as it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">plays? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">Visualize that on two canvas tags, plus Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">GL transforms a little bit of a reflection </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2150">on the bottom there. Can't do that with HTML5 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2150">audio. What we have now is ability to tie </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2161">in to what's called a Web audio API, tie in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2161">an audio tag as a source to that API, so instead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">of driving the Web audio API, via, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">an XHR request or something, we can just send </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">data directly to it &mdash; sorry &mdash; via &mdash; via </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">this audio tag, so it's really, really important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2171">This doesn't have to just be a video. It could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">be a &mdash; excuse me, an audio tag, it could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">be a video tag, so imagine I had a HTML5 video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">playing, and that is the source to the Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">audio API, then you're visualizing sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">effects, as movie changes and dark monsters </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">pop out, you can really scare people. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">the way the search works is really easy, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2196">we have the Web audio guy. I encourage you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2196">to go to Chris Wilson's session later in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2199">week about this, really amazing API. A lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2199">of low level access to the core audio of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">system. High level JavaScript API on top of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">it. Create an audio context. Notifications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2210">&mdash; I will create HTML5 audio element, I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2210">populate it with MP3 as its source, set up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">a couple of controls, some auto play on it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">The important integration point between these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2224">two, sort of the old audio working with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2224">new Web audio, the capabilities of that API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2229">is this create element source, media element </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2229">source. That's how the audio tag is sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2235">filtered and piped into the Web audio API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2235">Which leads us conveniently into Number 10. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2247">So I get this one a lot. A lot of people ask: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">"Hey, how come HTML5 can't do, you know, streaming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">audio? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">Or streaming media?" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">And it actually can. It can do that through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">another old friend, WebSockets. So WebSockets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2259">have been around for a while. It sort of suffered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2259">from the same limitation of Webworker, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2263">you can only send just basic data. It can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2263">send string data. That's not so handy, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">We have things like files and array buffers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">and ability to use complex data. We should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2274">be able to send and stream multi-media or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2274">files to our web apps. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2278">So we can do that now with WebSockets. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2278">WebSockets has a new sort of socket, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">binary type is the property you set on this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2284">And you set it to a blob or you set it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2287">an array buffer, and that tells the WebSocket </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2287">that's going to be speaking binary data instead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2292">of just regular string data. What's awesome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2292">about this is on my on message event, I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">use that directly to set an image source, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">for instance, from a blog URL. Instead of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2303">having to base 64 encode data on either end, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2303">decode it, which is, you know, the overhead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">associated with that, we can just use the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">data directly that we get back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2312">So I have a couple of demos of this. The first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2312">is a Chrome extension. So I have a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2322">Chrome extension installed here and top right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2322">corner. I'm going to click this guy. Imagine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2327">this is my viewer. I'm going to basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2327">do a sort of screen cast from the Web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2332">This is my viewer, imagine this is somewhere </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2332">around the globe. I'm going to open a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">window, pretend that's here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2337">So when I click this guy again, it's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2341">to fire up a Websocket, binary Websocket, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2341">and use the Chrome extension, screen capture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2347">API to capture the current tab. Google.com. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2347">Sports, because sports is great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2355">So on the right side, I have my presenter, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2355">this is just capturing the current tab as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2361">a png as I scroll. It's sending that data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2361">through a WebSocket to the remote party. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">can see it's very performant. I don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">to do any basic 64 encoding. As I'm scrolling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">on the right on the live page, that image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">is just being sent across the wire in near </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2375">real-time using the WebSocket. That's really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2375">really sweet, right? We can do this now thanks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2379">to the Chrome extension API, yes, but also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2379">via a binary WebSocket. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2384">Whoa, inception. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2384">[Laughter]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2390"><span class="speakerName">Eric Bidelman</span>: We can also do other things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2390">with different types of media. So I just showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2397">you a little teaser preview of the Web audio </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2397">API. The API allows you to analyze sound in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2402">real-time as it plays. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2402">What I have here is a page that sets up a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2408">binary WebSocket, and it's going to use the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2408">file reader API to essentially cut an MP3 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2413">file up into multiple smaller chunks and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2413">it's going to connect to that WebSocket, send </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2419">each of those chunks across the wire, on my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2419">&mdash; on my left side here, the viewer side, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2425">I'm going to use the Web audio API to schedule </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2425">those chunks at very precise times exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2430">when they should happen. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2430">So essentially I reconstruct the audio on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2433">the other end and just sort of use the sequence </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2433">that it should be in and then visualize that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2438">using the Web audio API. I'm going to load </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2438">up an MP3 file here on my DJ machine, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2445">guy in the right corner. Binary WebSocket, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2445">web audio API. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2449">No sound? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2449">There we go, there's sound. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2453">[ Music ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2453"><span class="speakerName">Eric Bidelman</span>: So again, streaming from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2457">one client, streaming audio data using a WebSocket, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2457">using the Web to reconstruct it and then visualizing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2468">in real-time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2468">You can see the chunks coming in, I'm receiving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2471">sort of mini chunks of that MP3 file as I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2471">reconstruct the audio and sort of the current </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2474">time is playing. Just to prove to you this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2474">is streaming, I refresh this, come back at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2482">the exact same spot.
