<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="39"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Hi, everyone. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">I'm Paul Kinlan. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">I'm here with one of my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">good friends Glenn. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="44"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Hi, everybody. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">So excuse some of the angles </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">that we've got at the moment. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">We've just opened a brand new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">recording studio in London. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">I believe you're actually our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">first external guest. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="57"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: That's nice. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="58"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah, it's cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="58">So today is Web Intents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">Wednesday. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="60">This is all fortnightly or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">biweekly coverage of what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">happening in the world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">of Web Intents. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="67">So, yep, this is our first week </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">in our new office with an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">external guest, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">is pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="72">Just a bit about me. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="73">So I'm a developer advocate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">at Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="75">I work at Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="76">And in particular, I work on a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">project called Web Intents, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">which is what we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">to talk about today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="81">And our first talk that we had, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">I think it was about four </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">weeks ago, I had to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">go on holiday. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="86">I shouldn't say I had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">to go on holiday. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="87">I wasn't forced to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">go on holiday. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="90">My first one of these we did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">in a different room. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="93">We had Alex Kormorske, and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">were talking generally about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">the project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="96">And we didn't actually get to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">tell you anything about &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">well, we did get to tell you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">about Web Intents, but we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">didn't get to show you kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">how Web Intents worked in real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">life inside the browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="106">I know it was because my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">machine wasn't set up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">properly, but today, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">we're all set up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="111">We're good to go, and I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">give you a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">demonstration about what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">Web Intents are. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="115">But before we do that, I'd just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">like to ask Glenn to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">about himself kind of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">you're working on, what you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">been working in the past, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">and what you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">done with Web Intents. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="123"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: So I'm an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">independent developer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="125">I've had my company in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">past, and I've been doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">JavaScript for quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">a long time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="129">And I became interested in Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">Intents about well over a year </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">ago, actually, a place in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">Portland, IndieWebCamp, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">there was a big discussion that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">went on about Web Intents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">and the possibility there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="139">Chris Messini actually brought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">the subject up, and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">really where my fascination </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">started with it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="144">Now, my background is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">design and user experience as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">well as doing coding. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="148">So in the beginning of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">year, I tried to bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">together a group of people in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">Brighton the event called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">Design Push where we looked at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">some more UI elements of this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="158">And I mean UI not just in terms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">of what goes on in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">browser, but how you create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">buttons, and the verbs you'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">use, and the language you would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">use around it as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="166">So that's one element of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="167">But I've also been doing quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">a lot of experimenting with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">the code as it progressed as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">it's gone along, because I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">quite interested to start using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">it as soon as possible. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="175"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">I think it was full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">frontal last year? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="177"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">I think they talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">full frontal. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">I did actually manage at the end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">of the talk to do a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">demo with some contact stuff, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">because I'm quite interested </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">in how to use contacts and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">information you find business </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">people's information and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">want to exchange backwards and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">forwards between applications. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">So I did a little demo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">there by contacts. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="193"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: So just to put, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">think, in a wider picture as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">well, you were using a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">of different APIs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">like drag and drop &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="198"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="198"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: And then hooking up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">these applications together </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">with Web Intents and then did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">you also use a protocol </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">handler or &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="205"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: I have done some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">work with the protocol </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">handlers around picking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">up telephone numbers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">and things like that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">It's also to bring that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">information in. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="211"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="211">So that's kind of interesting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">really. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="213">So thanks for that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="214">Just before we dive into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">everything, I'm going to try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">and give you a really good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">demo of kind of what Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">Intents are, how they work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">inside Chrome, because Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">has got an implementation of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">kind of the experimental </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">implementation, at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">least, of Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">Intents inside the browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="229">So I'm just going to produce, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">do all this magic production </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">and switch cameras. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="235">Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="236">So you should be able to see my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">screen in front of me now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="238">This is just a normal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="240">It's called Imagemator. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="241">It's a very simple app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="243">It's changed quite a bit since </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">my very first version. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="245">We got some other people in to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">make it all look pretty, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">because the version prior to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">this was all programmer art. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="252">Yeah, you could tell it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">programmer art and stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="256">So this is our application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="257">All it needs to do is be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">to bring images into this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">application and then do some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">magic with it once &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">I'll just do some general </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">magic with it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="265">So let me just show you kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">in action and then I kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">of want to briefly show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">you some code. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="269">It won't be much code because I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">think that's the part about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">Web Intents, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">is pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="273">You can get applications just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">to talk to each other with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">very little code involved. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="277">So anyway, this is our app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="279">We're going to pick an image. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="281">There we are. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="282">Now, as you can see, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="282">a picker in front of us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="284">It's a little kind of dialogue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">inside Chrome, which, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">theory, can't be spoofed by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">any kind of normal web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="292">So the thing that happens here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">is we got a list of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">applications that we can use, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">capture browser screen, pick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">file from Cloud File Picker, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">and whole load of other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">applications. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="304">These are applications that I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="304">installed in Chrome kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">of knows, supports the action </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">of picking images. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="310">We also have some suggestions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">in the bottom of the screen, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">web page screenshot, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">image, and Haystack. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="315">These aren't installed, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">all this information about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">what applications can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">do is stored in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">the Chrome Web Store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="321">So we can query the Chrome Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">Store to get a list of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">applications that might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">be able to help us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">fulfill this action. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="327">So anyway, let's have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">look at a quick demo. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="329">So pick from Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">File Picker. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="332">Cloud File Picker is just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">another application that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">built that integrates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">with Google drive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="337">It's kind of pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="338">So it's the normal kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">one-pick experience, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">single-picker experience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="343">Let's choose an image. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="344">This is one that people seem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">to like of me sometimes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="347">This is actually a bug. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="348">It should take you back to your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">original application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="351">But as you can see, once we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">switch back, you can see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">image has been brought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">back into our app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="355">One thing, which is in our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">application, we can actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">do a couple of things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="358">We can either save it to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">cloud somewhere, share it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">somewhere else, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">we can edit it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="362">So the demo that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">try and like to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">show is Edit in Action. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="366">So this is basically ask the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">browser for a list of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">applications that can support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">image editing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="371">Not word document editing, not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">video editing, just the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">ability to edit images. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="376">So we're going to edit in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">Mememator, which is another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">application I built. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="380">And again, it looks a lot nicer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">than it did originally. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="383">So hot. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="385">That's how we go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="386">Sorry. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="387">Hot. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="388">As you can see, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">image is updated. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="391">There it is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="393">And scroll down, press </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">Done Editing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="396">And what should happen here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">is of the data that's been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">edited in one application, has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">been brought back into this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="402">So the really cool thing about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">this is, is that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">integrated three or four </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">different apps, but actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">all we've done is we've asked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">the browser for some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">functionality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="409">We haven't actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">had to do deep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">integrations with these APIs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="412">And I just want to show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">you the code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="415">Hopefully, this will work if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">I get this just right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="423">And I'll zoom in a bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="423">so we can see it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="426">This is the entirety </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">of the application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="428">It's about 40 lines of code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="429">And as you can see here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">we have got Save </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">button click Action. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="434">And then once we click the Save, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">we fire off an intent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="437">There's two lines of code to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">off and find applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">that you want to use for common </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">actions across the web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">and to deliver data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="444">I think personally, it's pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">powerful, and this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">exactly what we're working on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="448">These are the types of things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">that we are working on inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">Web Intents. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="452">So back to the mainstream. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="455">That was my demo of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">the application. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="457">It's kind of interesting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="458">We've got the ability to hook up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">applications, which, at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">moment, from the way that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">developed apps in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="464">past, we've never been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="464">able to easily do. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="466"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: No. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">I mean if you think about any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">other way of doing this like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">with Olav on the server, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">amount of code you would need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">to actually wire two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">applications together using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">Olav is really considerable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">compared to what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">we just looked at. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="476"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="476">Actually, we didn't even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">touch on that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="478">So the thing that's happening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">right here is, normally, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">you have two applications, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">talk to each other on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">web at the moment, you kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">pass the data from your web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">app kind of client side </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">to the server. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="488">The server talks to another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">server with all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">authentication stuff going on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">in the middle and then goes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">from that service application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">maybe back in the client app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">on the other side. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="496">And at least what we've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">trying to do in Web Intents, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="498">in our case, is let's say, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="498">quite often you have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">data in one browser tab and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">want to transition it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="505">another application in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="505">another browser tab. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="506">Why can't you just deliver the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">data kind of from your page to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">the service page inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">the browser? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">So that's is kind of a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">good point is we're not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">basically saying that you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">going to deliver all data by a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">kind of client-side only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">channels, but like the option, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">in theory, is that &mdash; </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="522"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">A lot more simple. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">A lot easier to implement. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="525"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="525">So I have a script of things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">that we are going to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">about today, at least. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="529">So just to kind of go over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">some of the things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">happened in the last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">two weeks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="535">We've seen a lot of reports </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">about RSS integration and Atom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">integration inside Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="542">Just to kind of give everyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">like an overview of what this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">actually means and what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">happened is &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">Recently, I think it was at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">start of this month about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">three weeks ago, when the stable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">channel updated, we had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">some functionality inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">Chrome, which would basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">say, well, whenever a user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">visits an RSS feed, whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">it's the BBC news &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">And I'll tell you what. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="561">I'll just actually show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">this as a demo now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="566">So when the user visits say the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">BBC, for instance, I had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">no idea it was going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">appear on the screen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="575">It clicks on an RSS feed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="577">In the past, what's happened </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">is that in Chrome, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">particular, it's just dumped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">to the XML to the screen, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">which is a pretty bad experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">for users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="586">What we've got instead is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="586">application will fire this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">thing called the View Intent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="591">Let's say that the application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">will fire a View Intent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="594">So any RSS feed that you view </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">and visit, it will pop up this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">picker that we see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">in front of us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="600">So in this case, I've got two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">applications, one is called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">Message Board, which is by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">Julian Jenistow in France. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="606">I believe he's in France anyway, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="606">feed intent viewer. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="610">And this is how we view the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">Feed Intent viewer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="611">So we've taken the data from BBC </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">news feed and presented it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="615">back to Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="616">So right now, we don't have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">ability to view the source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">that we used to have in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">Chrome, which a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">developers have been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">asking for. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="623">The Feed Intent Viewer is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">designed and it's made by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">Mikhail [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">Epstein. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="628">It's basically designed to let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">you do what you did in Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">originally. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="633">Now, our plan, and we're still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">working on this, our rough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">plan is to basically say, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">we want you to at least </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">be able to use the default from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">something that wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">from Chrome in the first place </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">but also still take advantage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">of Web Intents via the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">picker that we have. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="648">Hey, there's my picture. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="650"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: I mean that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="650">really interesting, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">the viewer was one of the sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">of things unlike Edit and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">Share which, to me, was a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">bit unexplained to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">start with. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">And this is a really nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">example of how the viewer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">actually works in terms of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">lousy type of alternative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">perspective on something. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="665">And a different way of viewing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="665">it, gives you the choice of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="667">how to view something. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="668"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="673">So just to kind of jump back, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">there is actually a couple of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">different intents. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="676">So we've kind of come up on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">webintents.org with a list of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">a kind of common actions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">that we think the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">does across the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="683">They view things on the web, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">which is the View Intent, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">edit data, they share links, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">images, videos. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="689">They share a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">things on the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="691">They pick data in and they save </span><span class="line" data-startTime="691">things back out to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">cloud whether it's Dropbox, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">Box.net, or Google Drive. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="697">And so we've got five or six </span><span class="line" data-startTime="697">different types of intents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">that cover those actions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="702">And if we jump back to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">application, you'll see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">this is just a View Intent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="706">So like you said, it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">different perspective on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">data that was on behind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">the URL at the time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="710">So we've got a couple of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">different applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="712">RSS feed readers are a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">nice Chrome extension. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="714">I actually want to talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">this one a little bit more, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="716">because the guy, Eric, who built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="716">this application, he was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">basically one of the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">people to actually integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">with the View Intent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="725">And once he had done that, he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">landed in Chrome, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="728">then available to every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="728">single user of Chrome. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="730">Once it's in stable, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">available to every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="731">single user of Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="733">And because we can present the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">list of applications that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">can use from the Chrome Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">Store, like the discovery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">mechanisms from find and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">installed apps when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">haven't got one installed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">already. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="743">He got a whole lot of installs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">I think, and he can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">tell you himself properly, he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">had about 60,000 installs in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">the first five or six days. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="750">And he's got, I did a check on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">the Chrome Web Store today, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">and he's got to 220,000 installs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">for his Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">extensions of Views Intents. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="759">The feed reader as well is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">another popular one that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">[? Meihi ?] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">made. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="761">You have about, I think, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">14,000 after the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">first week or two. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="765">So the way I kind of look at, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">that the more that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">integrate with Chrome, the more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">opportunities third-party </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">developers have to integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">with the functionality that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">was never available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">to them before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="775">So that's basically an overview </span><span class="line" data-startTime="775">of what's kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">happened with the View </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">Intent at least. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="783"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="783">got a question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">So if you were to ever say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">when you view an image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="788">usually, if you just purely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="788">view an image and it just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">shows you an image in the corner </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">of the screen, usually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="792">in there, if that was ever to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="792">opened up in a similar way, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">could build something that maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">did a nice sort of black </span><span class="line" data-startTime="798">screen, centered it, and maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="798">even read some of the metadata </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">like what camera was used to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">take that photograph or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="803">something like that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">And provide a different view </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">yet again on something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">was very similar in terms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">of viewing things. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="808"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="809">I think that's kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="809">interesting once you can start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">to think about opening up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">different types of file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">formats and things that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">would just, like you said, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="815">they would just see the white </span><span class="line" data-startTime="815">screen for the rest of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">image, and like the image would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">be at the top left. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="819">If you could provide say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="819">Photoshop.com, for instance, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">or the different sites and apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">and services, the ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="824">to say you know what, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="824">we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">handle this data type. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="828">Then I think that's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">powerful kind of app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">ecosystem along the way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="831">You integrate directly with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">the functionality of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">browser just to let the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">use those actions. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="836"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: And even something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="836">as simple as an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="837">image, which you think, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="837">you just display it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">It has information built into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">it like the camera, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">where it was taken. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">You can even have enough data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">information you can put a map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">next to it and say this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">image was taken here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="846"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">I mean that's some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">of the goal. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">I think the fair thing to say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">at the moment is we've just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">started kind of conservatively, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">just RSS feeds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">and Atom feeds. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">We're going to get a whole lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">of feedback because some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">the stuff that we found so far </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">with just integrating the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">ability to view an RSS feed is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">it's driven the changes that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="867">we've made to some of the kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="867">of things that we've made in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">the spec recently. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">So I'm going to comment on this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">as well in a minute and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">kind of give you a summary of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">what's happened over the W3C </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">and on the specs about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">Web Intents at least. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="876"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: But as soon as you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">start doing things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="878">that, people like me start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="878">thinking about how can we use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="880">this, and what's next thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="880">that can be done. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">Just like that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="884"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">This is a powerful thing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">It's like you can kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">of get these little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="887">hooks into the browser. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">I mean, I want like Web Intents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">integrated everywhere </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">across all the browser. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">I honestly don't think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">going to be there just yet. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">I mean, if I go my way I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">do it, but I think right now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">it's RSS feeds, Atom feeds, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">things that people &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">We've always had a not great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">experience inside Chrome, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">we want let users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">use those apps. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="906">So I think it's quite good. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="907"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: And you can see how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">developers would like to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">see the raw code. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">There may be different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">ways of exploring it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">We might spin it out and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">stuff like that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">But for other people, it might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">just presented to be in nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="918">paragraphs like I would have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="918">in a normal RSS reader. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="922"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="923">So that's pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="924">I just want to jump on to some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">of the questions of things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="926">that have happened </span><span class="line" data-startTime="926">over the week. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="928">So what's going to happen now is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">I mean if you want to come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">up with any questions even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">if they're really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">hard questions, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="933">Just ask f it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="935">I just want to briefly talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">about some of the changes that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">have happened in the past week </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">to the specification. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="940">So the thing that's happened in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">the moment is that we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">want Web Intents to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">be Chrome only. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="944">I mean all the code has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">committed to Chrome, and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">a WebKit, which means that any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">WebKit-based browser can take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">advantage of Web Intents. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="951">But that's not the great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="951">story, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">I mean you've got three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">hundred million users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="954">Potentially, you could take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">advantage of Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="957">But the rest of the internet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="957">out there, the billions of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">users who use the internet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">now should be able to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="963">applications that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="963">want to use. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="964">So our goal at the moment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">is to try and get this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="966">standardized and integrated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="966">into other browsers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="970">So what's happening is we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">a group, which is kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="972">shared between DAP on the W3C </span><span class="line" data-startTime="972">and the public web apps group. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="976">And then there's also some stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">going on at the WHATWG </span><span class="line" data-startTime="978">at the same time where we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="978">basically talking about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="981">things that we need from an API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="981">to make these applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="985">interconnected, make it easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="985">for developers to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="988">So some of the things that have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">happened recently, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="991">literally it's like in the past </span><span class="line" data-startTime="991">week, that we've made, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">some of these that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">talked about at least. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="997">I'll give you a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="997">bit of background. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="998">It's probably best that I give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">you some background. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1000">So the code that we had in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1000">past for talking to an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">application inside Web Intents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">at least was, you would invoke </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">an intent, you make an intent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">object, give it the action. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1010">So I need to share this image. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1013">Well, I need to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">this thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1014">Give it a data type that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1014">thing that you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">share, so an image. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1016">I need to share an image. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1018">And then you would actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1018">give the intent object the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1020">data that you wanted to share. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1021">And the way that we thought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">about it originally was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">actually this data object should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">just be the raw data, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1027">should be a BLOB or linked to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1027">the URL link to where I save </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1031">the images. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1033">And a lot of the feedback that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">we had quite early on at least </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">and recently, is that it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">not enough information. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1040">If you've got an image, there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1040">might be some imitating code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">like meta information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">encoded into image. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1046">But the problem that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">got is, well, the name. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1049">Where's the file come from? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1050">If you're only passing the raw </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1050">data, a BLOB, it has no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">concept of a file name. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1055">URL might have a file name, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1055">but it might be like a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">randomly-generated ID that some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">social networking inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">generates for an image, not the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">actual physical name of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">the image itself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1064">So we took all this feedback, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1064">you know, people wanted all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">this extra metadata in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1068">And originally, we did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1068">this thing called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1070">SetExtra and GetExtra. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1072">So you're basically set a key </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1072">value per problematically just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">by a one-method call, one method </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">is called to set and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1079">one method is called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1079">to read it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1081">And you spoke to developers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1084">They hated it straight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1084">away, right? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1085"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1086"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: It was kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1086">analogous to the way that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1088">Android works in a way you set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1088">up an extra data but, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">didn't seem webby and when we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">were building an application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1093">it was like, well, I have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1093">make 10 calls to set up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1096">Why can't you patch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">a dictionary in? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1098">And then we're thinking, OK. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1099">Well we've got a dictionary, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">we could just say this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">actually is the dictionary. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1102">And one of the things that we do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1102">at the moment and there's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1104">current like a thread </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1104">on the W3C public </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">intents list at the moment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1109">The thread at the moment is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1109">saying, well, why do we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">two objects? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">Why do we need the actual data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">object and the payload and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1116">actual object. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1117">Why can't we just have one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">object with an extra set of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">metadata and the physical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">data itself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1122">So we're kind of talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">about it right now. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">We don't necessarily need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">make changes inside Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">Intent's implementation inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">Chrome because the way it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1130">works inside Chrome at least </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1130">is that it shares </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">a JavaScript object. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1134">So any object that you have that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1134">can be serialized by this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">structured clone algorithm can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">be passed between Windows, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">essentially. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1140"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: I mean what you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1140">talking about makes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">complete sense to me, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">quite often when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">dealing with APIs, you have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">concept of envelopes where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">you have like the metadata and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">then within that, you have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">object that's being passed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1152">Often with API, that might be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">things like if it's a list of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">things, how many items </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">are there and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">how that was achieved. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1159">And this always seems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1159">to be some sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1162">envelope that goes on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1163">It's very rare that just the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1163">data itself is passed across. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1167">So it makes a lot of sense to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">me that you would envelope </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1169">this somehow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1170">And although a dictionary is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">good, my personal view is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1175">often I already have an object </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1175">which is a representation of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">the data from wherever I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">collected it from. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1181">So as long as that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">understandable and everybody's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1185">agreed on that as a structure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1185">pass that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1187">backwards and forwards. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1188"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: So when you were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">passing microformat data &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1191"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">So &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1192"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: How </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1192">did that work? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1192"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: So strangely, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1192">microformat data, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1196">microformats was first skimmered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1196">up, they never had a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">concept of a JSON structure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">for it, which is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1204">being rectified when they came </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1204">around to look up the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1207">microdata format. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1208">But part of the microdata format </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">is actually a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1210">well-defined JSON structure for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1210">everything that the parser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">has to bring out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1214">So I'm thinking of a specific </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1214">way, and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">actually part of the spec. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1217">So for microformat community, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">and a couple of other people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1221">actually wrote a spec for how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1221">you describe parse microformat </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">in JSON, and it's called ufJSON </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">or something like that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">So what's actually being passed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">in the application I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">was using is a ufJSON object. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1236">It itself has an envelope. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1237">It has things like what parser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">was that passed it, how long </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">it took to parse it, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">original URL, and any base </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1244">HREF as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1245">Because it has to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">sometimes do some sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">changes from absolute URLs to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">relative to absolute URLs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1252">So there is little bits of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1252">small metadata there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1255">And I encapsulated it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">in that format. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1258"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: I should have spoke </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">to you a lot more about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1260">this earlier on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1262">Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1262">So I think that's the kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">model that I started to move </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1264">to at least anyway where we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1264">to be a little bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">prescriptive about the data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">formats even though you might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1270">say you're passing an image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1270">/png, there are actually types </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">of metadata that we want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">pass that you would sit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1276">alongside the actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1276">raw data itself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1279">I remember when we first talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1279">about Web Intents, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1283">activity streams as well. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1284">They have verbs and objects, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1284">at the time, it was like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">well, actually they're pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">well-defined objects. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1289">They were defined XML at that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">time, because they were meant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1293">to be integrated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1293">in Atom feeds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1296">The question that came up was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1296">well, can you do that in JSON </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">And I think they had a method </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">for representing those objects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1303">in JSON as well. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1304"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: They did. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1305">Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1305">They moved on moved </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1305">on to do that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1308"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: So with microdata, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1308">that's part of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1311">HTML5 spec? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1311"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: I believe so. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1312">Yes. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1312">It was one of the learnings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1312">that came out of the whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1315">sort of microformats thing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1315">if you're going to embed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">the parsers into the browsers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">then you have a way of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">representation. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1325"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Is that serialized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">with a two JSON </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1327">method or is that &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1329"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Now, you're getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1329">beyond maybe what my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1331">knowledge is. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1333">I looked at that, and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1333">something I want to look at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1335">actually next time. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1337"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1337">Because that would be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1337">kind of cool, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">Because if you could just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">literally pass a down element </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1340">as your data, understand that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1340">actually well, you can't pass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">down elements across but if we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">could say is part of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1347">structure called the algorithm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1347">or the algorithm that takes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1349">data from like client to service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1349">that he will call a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1353">two-JSON method or something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1353">on an object. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1356">And if the HTML element </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">supported it and then went </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1358">through the rules for parsing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1358">that into microdata and just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1362">return the JSON, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1362">that would be &mdash; </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1363"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1364">I mean it has to be for pulling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1364">this information out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">and it's a JavaScript type </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">that is built into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1370">browser, so it has to be JSON, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1370">basically until it comes out. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1373"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: That's really kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">of interesting, though </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1374">because I can see how &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1375"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Well, an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1375">object literally. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">We don't say JSON. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">It's an object literally. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1378"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1378">An object in a way but that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1378">actually really interesting. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">Because one of the things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">I was thinking about was you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">could either write a Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">extension, for instance or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1389">have it built into the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1389">where if you detected these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1392">objects like living inside the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1392">page, is that you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1394">provide contextually-aware </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1394">actions off those objects. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">So if you found like a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">person it just looked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1400">like a person's address. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1403"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: So I mean the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">technique you're talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1406">is actually what I did. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1407">Because I built a JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1407">parser for microformats that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">was built for people to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">make extensions with. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1413">And it was based off some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">original work from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">Mozilla ages ago. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1416">But I took it and I stripped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">it down, and it's called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1419">microform app shift. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1420">And it's actually the main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1420">Chrome extension that displays </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1424">microformats uses this code. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1426">And it does exactly what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1426">you're talking about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1428">It's got method, which you pass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">in the DOM element and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">passes back this ufJSON </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">structure for you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1434"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: And did you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1434">manage that extension? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1436"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Someone else has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">actually built the extension, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">but I built the parse and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">built it in a way so that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1440">people could build extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1440">with it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">It's basically a library that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">built for people to put in. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1447"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: So does it detect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1447">it in the page or detect it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">like in a little tab like a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">little button across the top? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1452"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: The library itself, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1452">you basically have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1455">say give it a DOM element, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1455">and it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1459">tell you whether this &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1460">It will actually give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1460">you a count as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">So if you just want to see if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">there's something in there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1464">So most of the extensions are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1464">passing information first look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1468">just for the trigger. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1469">So they'll say, OK. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">Has this got one of the classes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">that would be a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1473">top-level class. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1473">In which case, now let's parse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1473">a whole document and finds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">it's structure. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">And that's how most of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">microformats passing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1479">extensions work. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1484"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: I've got little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1484">things get in my head. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1485">I kind of got some ideas. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1486">Yeah, I actually wouldn't mind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1486">trying to do something like &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1488"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: And one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1488">things I wanted to do as well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1490">as, obviously, the microdata </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1490">thing, I think, is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1494">something that I built a parser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1494">for, because I know the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">browser manufacturers and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">vendors are going to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1499">them because it's part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1499">of the HTML5 spec. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1500">At some point, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1500">will come forward. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1502">But I'd like to also do some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1502">of this stuff for maybe the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1506">Facebook Open Graph data and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1506">newly the Twitter card systems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">where, which are both two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">different types of metadata </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">that are now being put into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">websites on large scales </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">because of the SEO benefit and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">the ability to get your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">content shared into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">social systems. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">Of course, obviously, with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">MicroTech we've also got our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1525">sharing it to Google+. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1527">But some parsers that do similar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1527">things pull up data as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1531">well and make that available. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1533"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: I would actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">like to be able to just to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1535">deliver objects that we find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1535">on a web page to any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1540">application that says </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1540">it can support it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1543">Wow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1544">OK. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1546">Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1546">So jumping back to the subject, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1546">we are getting rid of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1551">the extras, GetExtra, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1551">is extra. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1553">So we getting ride of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1554">It's part of kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1554">a specification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">that's done this process. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1557">So obviously, we need to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1557">commitment from kind of all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">participants in the group. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1561">I think it looks pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1561">positive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1564">Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1565">So as extras, I was going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1565">say that the data you pass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1568">along should have all this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1568">extra information in it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1570">From a documentation point of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1570">view, we need to be really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1572">smart about how we document </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1572">the data that should be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1575">embedded like in these data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1575">types that gets passed, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1578">because I get experience on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1578">other systems where one might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1582">expect a title and if a service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1582">doesn't send a title, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1586">then what happens, the client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1586">application and all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1588">that type of stuff. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1588">So I think we can set some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1588">really best practices in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1591">documentation for how this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1591">is going to work. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1593"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1593">I mean my only point there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1593">would be to, you reuse, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1597">obviously, as much as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1597">possibly out there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">Yeah, and that interestingly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">these contacts, you've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1602">this beautiful thing the vCard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1602">which is then being reused by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">Microforms it's hCard. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">It's nearly a one-to-one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">match across. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1609">So it's always about paving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1609">those cow paths and reusing as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1613">much as you possibly can. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1613"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1615">So this is actually an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1615">interesting point. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">But I think the DAP </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">we're talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1618">about delivering contacts. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1620">And I think we were talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1620">about the good and new contact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1624">API but using intents but then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1624">we'd have to describe the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">delivery mechanism. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1628">So it's kind of interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1628">that we should &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1631"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: So I saw some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1631">the original discussion on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1636">mailing list about this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">And it looks like some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">mechanisms that they are using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1641">are very similar to the popular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1641">contacts work that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1645">done, which again, was actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1645">based on some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1648">original hCard, vCard work. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">So yours get some sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">layering that's going on. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">I think the interesting thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">is to make sure that you as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">much as possible base things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">on the earliest standard so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">you don't have to translate so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">much material from one thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">to another. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1665"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1666">So Actually, I need to go back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">to activity streams as well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">because they had a whole lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">data formats that they were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1672">automatically well-specified </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1672">out like especially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">for images as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1677">So recent changes to the API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1678">This hasn't happened yet, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">but on the list, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1681">this talk about Origin. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1682">And what they're trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1682">to say is that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">So Origin is kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">interesting HTTPS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1688">You obviously refer and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">everything goes through. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1690">When you do an HTTPS like an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">HTTPS to HTTPS call at least, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">just like a normal web request, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">so the referrers was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1697">always lost. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1698">So they start to introduce </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1698">this idea of HTTP origin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">header so that you could at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">least understand the domain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1702">that certain things came from. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1705">And the request that's happened </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">recently on the Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1707">Intents mailing list on the W3C </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1707">is that can we include the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1711">Origin information in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1711">payload for the data that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1714">being transferred between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1714">Web Intents. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1715"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: So I think there is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1715">a really interesting point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1718">there that I don't think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1718">anybody's brought up yet, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1719">which is if you include the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1719">origin, so where the materials </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">come from, the receiving site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">then can do some interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">things with authentication, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">which I think is the main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1728">reason that people are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1728">interested in this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1730">But it also has a slight darker </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1730">mechanism that could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1733">kick in which would be that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1733">receiving site could say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">actually, I'm only going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">to accept data from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1738">certain other sites. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1741">And actually be a blocking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1741">mechanism, which is what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1744">found with OAuth because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1744">originally there were two ways </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">of doing it, one which would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">have been completely open, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1750">one OAuth site would have dealt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1750">with another one and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1753">stuff like that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1753">But it actually ended up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1753">people running white and black </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1757">lists for &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1760">OK, We're going to open up, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1760">and we're going to allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1761">people to OAuth between our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1761">site maybe contacts or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">something like that from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">one site to another. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1766">But we're only going to allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1766">authorized sites. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1769"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">I mean that was actually some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">the thing that people were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">asking for insight as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">part of the spec. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1777"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: And Origins </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1777">could give them that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">Because if &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1779"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">I generally understood when we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">were bursting with the API. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1783">I didn't want client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1783">applications to know about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">service applications and service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">applications to know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">about client application. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">At some point, they might be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">able to discern information. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1791">So if you passed an image that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1791">was just the URL, and you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1794">like I don't know, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1794">image.twitter.com, whatever it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1798">is, there's a good chance that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1798">the image was shared from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">Twitter or somewhere else, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">but you're never </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1801">actually quite too sure. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">It's one of those things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">this is the whole point about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1806">specification that's done with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1806">these processes is that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1808">talk these things out. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1811">I don't know what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1811">the answer is. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1812">I don't think anyone knows. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1813">It was only brought on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1813">list like two days ago. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1814"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: I think it's a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1814">prickly subject, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1817">I can definitely see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1817">benefits for widening some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">these cases and stuff. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1821">But it might be a reasonably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1821">serious or downside to this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">which takes away some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">ability of the browser to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">this completely transparent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">mediator that sits in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">middle, and isn't sort of a &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1833">You don't have to sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1833">commercial linkages that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1836">get with the AuthAssist. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1837"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1840">I don't quite notice yet. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1841">I mean if Origin was going to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1841">a factor because you didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">want to see data from certain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">services, I'd rather that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">part of your declaration of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">you could say, you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1851">handle, so that the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1851">could just not show your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1853">application on the list. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1854">Because I just think if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1854">deliver data to some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1856">application, which is then going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1856">to reject you, it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">bad user experience, right? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1862"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: So I think the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">answer is we don't quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1865">notice yet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1866">We're going to talk it out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">and see what happens. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1869">But as always, if you have any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1869">feedback and you have any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1871">particularly strong opinions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1871">about kind of whether, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">instance, Origin should happen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">or whether the way we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1876">to deal with extra metadata, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1876">please just get in the public </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">Web Intents list on the W3C. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1883">Or if you're trying to work out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1883">how to implement various </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1887">parts of the API, we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1887">also got Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1889">groups, discussion groups. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1890">I encourage you to, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1890">I think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1892">called Web Intents Discuss. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1894">I encourage everyone to go and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">view those pages at least </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1897">anyway fire us some emails, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1897">email me PaulKinlan.google.com </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">if you have any questions that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">you want to get answers to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">that you don't want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">put on your list. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1905">We try and get everything in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1905">open, but if you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1907">talk to me, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1907">fine as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1909">That's cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1911">So let me jump back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1914">I think we actually covered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">quite a lot of ground. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1917">I've actually run out of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1917">things I was supposed to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1919">over at some point. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1922">Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1922">I mean the interesting thing I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1922">find about Web Intents is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1927">for me, at least, I've learned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1927">a lot about the specification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">and standardization process. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1932">It's been pretty good. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1933">Other than that, everyone has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1933">been kind of open in talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">about the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">that they want. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1937">We have on the device group at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1937">least, people wanting to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1940">integrate with devices outside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1940">of your machine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1943">I did a podcast for SitePoint </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1943">last week, and they basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">said, what's the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">exciting thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1948">I've learned so much. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1951">We can integrate devices outside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1951">of your machine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1954">So the idea is like Web Intents, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">the scope is very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1959">much firmly in connecting web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1959">applications to other web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">applications. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1963"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1963">We saw how distant the design </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1963">push when we were talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1966">about the different use cases. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">And it sort of stymied off at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">the beginning of the day when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1971">we were trying to explain to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1971">a lot the UX designers who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1974">turned up to the event all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1974">different possible ways it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1976">could be used. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">That they focused initially on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">the whole share bit and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">share buttons, because that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">a really common use case. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1984">But as the day went on, people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1984">became more and more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">interested in the idea of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">sharing more complex data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1989">between applications and less </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1989">interested in the more obvious </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">sort of sharing in the Intents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">in the beginning, which I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1995">found really interesting that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1995">sort of shift as people start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">to see the broader picture. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1999"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: I always think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1999">the other intents are more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">interesting than share. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2004">I mean share is the one that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2004">everyone just says we just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2007">need to sort some way of getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2007">rid of all of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2009">buttons, all of these different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2009">options inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">pages, and is Web Intents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">going to do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2014">I think yes, you can. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2014">I think there's a whole lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2014">stuff that has to be solved </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2017">around branding, which we talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2017">about this design push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2020">around branding and kind of let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2020">users understand that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2023">button that they're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2023">click on is going to let them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">share to their preferred </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">network. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2027">Social reinforcement, that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2027">actually one of the areas that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2029">you talked about quite a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2029">was social reinforcement. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">The fact that you see that your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">friends have done certain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2034">actions on the page is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2034">quite influential. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2037">And Web Intents doesn't solve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2037">that, it doesn't say that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">well, you'd rather click </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">on this type of thing. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2045"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: I think if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2045">look at the share and what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">you're going through some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">plus and minus points of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2053">in terms of moving over to Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2053">Intents there is a definite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2056">case for doing it, but the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2056">difference between the benefit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">you get from a share, I think, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">from looking at the benefit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2062">you'll get from some of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2062">edit-type functionality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2064">You were just sharing about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2064">moving data from one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2066">application to the editor and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2066">bringing it back again. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2069">Then the benefit is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2069">really massive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2071">It's quite hard to achieve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2071">it any other way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2073">Whereas, at the moment, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2073">something that sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2075">works with the shares of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2075">everybody doesn't like it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2078">It's not quite what we want and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2078">stuff, but it's sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">billions of interactions every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">year using those bonds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2086">But with the edit, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2086">that's actually a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2088">completely new game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2089">And I think, so that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">where it is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2090">I think there is a difference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2092">your perceived benefit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2093">You can actually see the benefit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">we implemented than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2095">the more edit ones. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2096"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2098">I've been honestly surprised </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2098">about the uptake of the shared </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">view and RSS feeds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2103">I think that's got a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2103">lot of potential. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2105">I'm always talking to people, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2105">and say, what is the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">popular or the best intent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2109">It's like naming one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2109">you're kinds, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2110">It's like you're my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2110">favorite son. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2112">But it's like the idea behind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">it was like well, actually I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2115">think share is the one that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2115">everyone is going to see to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">think about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2118">Actually, things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">edit, pick and save. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2120">The cycle of taking data from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2120">one app, manipulating it, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2123">sending it back to like Dropbox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2123">or these types of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">services is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">really powerful. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2128">And that's the one that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2128">will be kind of &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">Those three will be the ones </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">that will really be take off. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2133">Obviously, we have to do a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">whole lot of work to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">partners, and services, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">and everything to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2136">integrate into that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2137">But when you look at the client, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2137">the browser as the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">client, then you only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">need services to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2143">fulfill one side of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2145">And I think that's where the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2145">view, especially view in RSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">and view in Atom feeds they've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">been really popular so far is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">that actually you only have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">tell the server like it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2154">doing great with the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2154">rather than integrate with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2156">other applications. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2270"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Is it the same sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">of stuff where it's just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2272">the context menu as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2273">You can use &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2274"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: So actually this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2274">is an extension I wrote. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2276">This is like the image you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2276">share like link to images not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2281">actually sharing the raw history </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2281">sharing the link to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2283">the image data. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2284"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: Which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">is really nice. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2285">Because you could imagine things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2285">like video as well and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">all sorts of different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">types of media that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2291">could be on the page. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2292"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yes. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2293">So it can do videos, audio </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2293">files, share links, when it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">knows it's sharing a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">link, not an image. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2302">Oh, there's another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2302">one as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2304">Share a link to an image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2304">and link share link. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2306">So I think it's pretty cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">It opens up quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">a lot of stuff. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2311">Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2311">It can do videos, RSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2311">feed, context menu. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2313">Obviously, it can do RSS feeds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2313">because it's a link. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2317"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: It gets to this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2317">point where you can actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2319">start to share elements of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2319">page, not just the whole page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323">itself with context menu. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2324"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: And it doesn't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2324">to actually be built into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2325">the browser it can have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2325">extension, which so clearly. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2328"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: I could imagine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2328">if you can swipe something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2330">like a piece of text, it doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2330">mean you can have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2332">equivalent like a share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2332">to a quoting type. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2334"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: I mean, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2334">exactly right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2336">You shared a tumbler as a quote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2336">rather than as a link. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2339">Those t of things would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2339">be pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2341">So actually, that's why I wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2341">to speak with the guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2343">who did the microform extension, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2343">because what I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2346">thinking of is if you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2346">detect things on the page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2348">where there's a person, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2348">could do a right click context </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">to ware menu and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">say, share this to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2352">your address book. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2353">Or share this to &mdash; there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2353">different types of actions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2356">That would be really cool. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2388">Wow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2388">I So yeah, the process is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2388">pretty interesting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2392">We are part of the W3C </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2392">process right now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2394">We're first public working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2394">draft, which is different when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2397">editors draft. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2398">An editor's draft is pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2398">much, I think any member can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2400">make an editor's draft. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2401">Then it needs to get accepted, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2401">I believe, at least by one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2403">group that goes to a first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2403">public working draft. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2407">You then work on it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2409">It's a specification. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2410">It's not standard at that point, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2410">but you're kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2413">working towards that process. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2414">So we're still at that first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2414">public working draft. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">I think we've got a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">of months to iron </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2418">all the stuff out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2418">And then we have I believe a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2418">corporate consensus later on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2421">and then a whole lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2421">of other stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2424">Just to put it bluntly, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2424">we're at the very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2425">first, the second stage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2427">The very first stage is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">just get on there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2429">The second stage is where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2429">we are right now. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2432"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2433">There's a lot of refinement. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2434">So the general process is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2434">feedback that either I capture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2437">from the Web and kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2437">a general sentiment. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">I try and deliver it to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">public intents group, a public </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2442">Web Intents group at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2442">least on the W3C. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2445">Or we, and I encourage everyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2445">who kind of want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2447">see the API change for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2447">specific reason or even just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2451">to say that we support this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2451">kind of way of working all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2453">those types of things, use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2453">cases and a whole loat of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">other stuff, is to go on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">public Web Intents list on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">W3C and then just give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">us your feedback. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2462">Because it's like if we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2462">developed this API in complete </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2466">isolation, we might find it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2466">doesn't serve a ninth of some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2469">of the things that we want. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2470">A ninth of the developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2470">don't use it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2472">And if they don't use it, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2472">don't get users, which means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2474">we don't get any one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2474">benefit from this. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2475"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: The most useful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2475">thing I've always found to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2478">have input. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2478">Because it's quite difficult to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2478">get involved with the spec </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2480">element of it because of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2480">way it works is to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2483">talk about use cases that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2483">have specific things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2486">And if you can't find out a way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2486">of doing it using what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2488">already been said, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2488">ask the question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2490">I have this use case, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2490">I want to do this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2492">How would I do it like this? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2493">Because that actually provides </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2493">the developers with a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2496">interesting sort of hook </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2496">to think about things. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2499"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2499">That's what happens, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2500">That's what's happening with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2500">Origin talk at the moment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2502">is there a very specific use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2502">case that someone wants to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2504">solve, which honestly we can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2504">solve right now in Intents the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2507">way the specification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2507">is designed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2509">So it's like do we either accept </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2509">it, reject it, or some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2514">kind of where in between. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2515">And that's the whole process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2515">is right now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2516">It's like we're at this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2516">stage where we're just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2518">talking about it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2520">The idea of Web Intents being it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2520">needs to be a standard for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2524">people to implement it, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2524">it depends on usage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2529">inside the browser, different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2529">usage of services. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2531">Because services kind of adopt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2531">it once it's in one browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2533">But we don't want it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2533">be a one browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2534">We want it to be across multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2534">browsers and that's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2537">whole heap of extra work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2537">that needs to go on in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2539">conversations that happened with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2539">all the browser vendors. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2542">The thing I would say is that it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2542">is going into WebKit, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2544">means that if you're a browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2544">vendor who implants WebKit or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2547">imports a WebKit, as long as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2547">you can take this ports </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2550">across, you could, in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2550">theory, turn on Web Intents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2553">whether you choose to or not. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2554">You just have to implement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2554">all the rest of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2555">logic behind it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2557">So yeah, that's kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2557">roughly where we are. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2561">Next question. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2562">So Patrick Lord. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2566">I know that name. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2568">If Web Intents are meant to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2568">replace shared buttons among </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2569">other things, would there be a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2569">way to know if you've already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2572">shared something? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2575">For example, if I plus one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2575">something, the plus one button </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2578">shows up red. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2578">Are there plans in Web Intents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2578">to support that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2581">So I kind of answered that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2581">before where we didn't have &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2584">Web Intents doesn't kind of do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2584">that social proof and remind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2587">and other things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2587">you've done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2588">It's not designed to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2588">say well, you know what, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2591">you've shared this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2591">link before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2593">You might not want to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2593">it again and all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2595">those types of things. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2596">The thing I would say and your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2596">opinion is completely valid </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2601">and appreciated, is that I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2601">there are the server, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2604">services and add this on this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2604">recently, where add this with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2608">integrated with Web Intents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2608">as well as the services. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2611">But they still provide that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2611">aggregation and social proof. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2614">So it's still a widget that does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2614">kind of all the work for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2617">account on what's happening on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2617">the social web, for instance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2620">But that's their service. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2622">They provide a whole lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2622">services outside of the just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2624">share and people think they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2624">sharing services. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2626">It's like they're not just that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2626">they're analytics, using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2628">management metrics and all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2628">those types of things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2632">I personally think that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2632">where that's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2633">live and still is. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2634"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: I think there is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2634">an answer to this particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2636">question in that there's two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2636">ways this could happen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2638">So when this [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2640">goes off, you're actually within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2640">Web Intents [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2643">it's just not giving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2643">the return. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2645">There should be like a success </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2645">return back to the site. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2648">And at that point, you as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2648">the site can recall that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2651">information that that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2651">being done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2653">And then mark that button, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2653">because the button is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2655">controlled by you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2656">So you kick it off, you design </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2656">it, it's got your images or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2660">text in it, and hook in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2660">intents by using the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2662">JavaScript onClick or whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2662">you're going to use. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2665">So you could do it that way or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2665">a slightly worse way would be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2668">you don't get the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2668">success just to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2669">actually recall from anywhere. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2671">Just recall to click. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2672">That doesn't say that it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2672">actually successfully been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2675">done, but at least </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2675">you know that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2676">someone has clicked there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2677">So I think there is mechanisms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2677">to do it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2679"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2680">I think there is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2681">And I think there will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2681">be services that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2682">pop up that do it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2683">I think, at least, are good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2683">example of their entering Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2686">Intents because it's like built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2686">into the platform, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2689">at the same time sharing isn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2689">their main, but they'll tell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2694">you what their main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2694">business is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2695">But it's like it's the rest of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2695">what they offer is the thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2698">that they do, analytics, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2698">metrics, all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2701">those types of things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2702">Just the facility to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2702">is one very small aspect. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2705">It's a kind of interest actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2705">this type of new +1 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2715">something, you've shared this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2715">I think that's very specific </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2717">just to the share intent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2719">I've never seen maybe there is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2719">maybe there isn't safe, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2723">you've already saved this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2725">Great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2725">But You might want to save it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2725">again to a different service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2727">all that type of stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2727">So I can't imagine some other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2727">intent using this type of &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2730"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: No. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2730">Because they don't use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2730">the same sort. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2732">When we talked earlier about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2732">social proof, that's a bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2735">like the where you get the like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2735">the little icons of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2736">people who have already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2736">done this in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2737">part in social network. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2739">It's not basically an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2739">encouragement or a number that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2741">tells you x number of people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2741">have done this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2743">It's a way of encouraging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2743">you to do it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2745">And you're right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2745">At the moment, I've only ever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2745">seen it used in the terms of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2750">the share-type implementations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2750">or the Likes and stuff like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2753">that, which are a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2753">similar thing. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2755"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: We're actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2755">really running out of time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2757">So I'm really sorry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2757">about this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2760">So how will the UX work for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2760">Chrome packaged apps? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2762">Will this selected external app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2762">open inside the app itself </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2766">or hand folks over to a separate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2766">browser window, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2769">is app not as magical? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2774">or will there be a way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2774">to send that intent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2777">on to packaged apps? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2778">So yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2779">We got this thing called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2779">Explicit Intents, b which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2781">allow you to deliver data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2781">to a known application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2784">I know you've got a whole load </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2784">of question about suggestions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2786">which I don't believe we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2786">implanted just yet. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2788"><span class="speakerName">Glenn Jones</span>: We'll leave </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2788">that for the day. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2789"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2791">But explicit intent they tend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2791">to deliver data from one app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2794">to another directly if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2794">you know about it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2798">The way it's going to work in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2798">packaged apps, I mean, the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2801">it actually works in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2801">Chrome now is it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2802">always opens a new tab. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2803">If it's a package app, the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2803">style packaged app is showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2806">up in a brand new instance of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2806">the application, because you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2808">won't have any browser Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2809">So yes is the answer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2814">Is there a shim or a polyfill </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2814">for Web Intents? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2816">I think the answer is no. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2817">How could we collaborate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2817">to make one? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2819">There is one, webintents.org/w </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2819">ebintents.min.js. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2824">It tries to emulate Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2824">Intents, the API. </span></p>
