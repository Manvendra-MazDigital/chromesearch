<p><span class="line" data-startTime="51">We need to go all the way back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">to 2009 and take a look at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">gaming ecosystem at that time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="57">In 2009, two major </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">things happened. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="59">Number one was the rise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">of web social gaming. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="63">We saw a lot of social </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">distributed gaming coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">through the cloud, coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">through these viral networks, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">being able to tap a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">generation, a new bucket of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">customers that typically weren't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">considered gamers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="74">These weren't people that big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">gaming companies were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">advertising to, or even thought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">that there was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">market there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="80">Number two that happened in 2009 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">was that we finally saw </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">the boom of the mobile gaming. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="84">Now the mobile ecosystem had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">been there for a number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">years, but really didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">come into its </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">stride until about 2009. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="92">Now, the rise of these two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">things brought something to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">game development the no one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">had really seen before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="98">And that was that any game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">developer could go out and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">make a very small budget game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">and get it in front of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">millions of people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="106">When you have this vacuum that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">was created for demand, of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">individuals wanting content both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">in the social game space </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">as well as the mobile space, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">gave rise to something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">none of us really expected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">at the time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="117">But it really generated the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">indie game developer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="121">And this is a situation where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">you have sort of the casual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">development space of just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">making websites, or easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">scripting, or people who come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">to the table wanting small </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">content, coupled with sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">the high-precision, high </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">frequency game development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">processes that we'd seen in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">AAA development, as well as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">skill sets that had come to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">the world for mobile handheld </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">development that we've seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">from other large publishers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="146">And this really gave rise to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">this developer who basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">became our fan icon for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">games industry overnight. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="154">It seemed like we were flooded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">with tons and tons of stories </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">about how individuals would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">spend the weekend in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">garage making a game, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">putting it up on the web or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">mobile, and then turning around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">and making $100,000 on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">it in the next week. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="167">And this type of information, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">when received by the general </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">populace of game developers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">created what I like to call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">the modern gaming gold rush. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="177">We had tons and tons and tons </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">of developers leaving their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">established companies with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">401(k)s and stock options, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">branching out into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">world of unknown self </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">entrepreneurship, looking to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">make the next big game. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="189">And a lot of them actually had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">a very, very good success. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="191">Now over time, though, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">to come to the conclusion that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">it's no longer 2009. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="196">In fact, it's 2012 now, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">a lot of the things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">happened back then are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">no longer the case. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="202">First off, a lot of these social </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">games in the social </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">networks have kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">of taken a fall. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="208">What we've seen is that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">social networks themselves </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">have reduced a lot of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">sharing and viral features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">that originally made those first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">generation of games so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">successful and so popular. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="218">It was very easy for them to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">basically flood your stream of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">information with, buy my pink </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">cow, buy my pink cow. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="224">In addition to that, because of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">the early success, we saw a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">huge influence and a huge pool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">of money come in from venture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">capitalists and other small </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">game development studios, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">which effectively just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">flooded the space. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="236">There's tons of clones, tons of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">one-offs, everyone trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">to do the same thing with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">different skin to kind of keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">your eyeballs and get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">your attention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">through their clicks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="246">On the other side of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">dime is mobile gaming. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="249">Now what mobile gaming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">has done now &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">don't get me wrong, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">mobile gaming is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">doing amazingly well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="254">In fact, I think the latest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">statistics still show like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">some 27 billion million umpteen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">zillion devices that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">are released and activated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">every day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="263">But what we're seeing there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">is that the market and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">ecosystem has been driven more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">by indie game developers than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">any other ecosystem. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="269">And the result there has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">just a flood of content, just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">an overwhelming number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">applications that have ended </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">up in that ecosystem. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="278">And the result has kind of been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">difficult, because large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">game developers, publishers who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">traditionally weren't in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">the space before, have now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">entered into the space, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">are competing against these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">indies for the same little 128 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">pixels by 96 pixel screen real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">estate in the promotional </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">systems that are there. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="294">So the indies are coming to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="294">table with lots of great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">ideas and having to fight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">against people with lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">marketing dollars. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="300">Which means something very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">interesting, is that with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">birth of everything that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">happened in 2009, it's never </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">been easier or more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">cost-effective to make a game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">and get it in front of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">millions of people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="312">The problem though, is it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">still just as hard to market </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">that game and actually convince </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">all the people in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">crowd that your content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">is worth looking at. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="323">So what we end up with, is you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">have a whole fleet of indie </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">developers all making content, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">expecting the environment to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">still resemble what it looked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">like in 2009, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">that's not the case. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="332">So what should you be doing? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">If you're a game developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">today, how do you get your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">message out? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">How you embrace users? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">How do you market your product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">properly when this may not be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">necessarily be your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">wheelhouse? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">The good news is that there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">a very established ecosystem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">that's well-versed in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">understanding how to get your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">signal out there with lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">noise in the ecosystem. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="353">And that multiverse is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">called the internet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="356">So the question really for this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">talk, and what I really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">want to address to everyone here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">today is what can the web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">to teach us about making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">more successful games? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">And I'm not saying put all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">your games on the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="366">I'm talking about learning and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">adapting and bringing the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">principles and traits of the web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">into your game development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">process, and your game, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">make it more successful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="376">Or better yet, what makes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">clicking a link and seeing a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">cat such a compelling vehicle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">for content that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">continuously do it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">That cat right there alone has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">some ungodly number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">hundreds of thousands </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">of views. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="390">That's an amazing vehicle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">and an amazing process. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="392">So what we're going to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">about today is three ways that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">you're going to be able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">webify your game, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">hopefully, or more specifically, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">have success in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">making better games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="403">The first part is going to be to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">ship all of your platforms. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="406">Now there's a great story that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">I'm going to tell, and if this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">story's about you, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">I apologize. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="412">I was actually at a game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">developer conference a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">weeks ago, and talked to a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">of people on the floor, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">was just getting a pulse on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">what game developers were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">going through. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="421">And I was talking to this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">developer who was lamenting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">over the state of the mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">ecosystem, and how he wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">making millions and millions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">of dollars like he was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">expecting to. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="430">And so I said to him, hey that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">cool, how are you doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">in the other ecosystems? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">How are you doing not on mobile, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">or in the competing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">mobile ecosystem? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">And his response was, I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">not in those ecosystems. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="443">I'm only in this one place. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="444">You can only find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">my program here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="447">And I kind of stopped and looked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">at him, like wait, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">you're not anywhere else? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">Why are you not embracing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">these other ecosystems? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">He says, well, I don't think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">it's worth my time, and/or I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">don't have money to do it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="458">This was not news to me. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="589">And really what you should be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">doing, is because of the fact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">that games are digitally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">distributable &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">we have the ability to just go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">and download the content &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">you should really be embracing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">the ability to allow the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">to get the content directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">from you as the developer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="603">Four or five years ago, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="603">kind of was unheard of because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">of the avenues online. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="608">It was really hard for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">standard developer to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">put the product online and sell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">it to people directly. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="613">There was lots of DRM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="613">issues out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="615">Console was kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="615">the big thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="617">A lot of people didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="617">put focus in this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="618">But today, in 2012, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">is very different. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="621">I want to talk to specifically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">about a great success story. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="625">There's a game out there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">called Gratuitous Space </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">Battles, by Positech Games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="629">And it's a fantastic game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="630">It's beautifully done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="631">It's all in 2D. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="633">And it was done by basically a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">little indie developer that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">shipped it in 2009. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="637">Now the developer of this, Cliff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">Harris, actually came </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">out at a great talk called World </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">of Love a long time ago. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="643">And the whole point of his talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">was, hey, I'm an indie. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="646">I need money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="646">Here's how I'm going outside of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="646">these channels to market my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="650">game and get money from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="650">other avenues. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="652">And one of the big things he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">came to with this was that he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">believed dominantly that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">should be allowing users to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">buy from your website. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="660">And in fact, if you actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">visit the Gratuitous Battles </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">website, you can actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">see tons of icons there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="665">You can buy with Amazon, with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="665">PayPal, with Google Checkout. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="669">There is a plethora of ways </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">for you to give him your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="672">money, if you already are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="672">signed in, or have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">established rapport, or an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">account on file, and whatnot. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="678">This is really cool, because it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">allows him to effectively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">connect with his customers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">outside of the ebb and flow of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="687">digital distribution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="687">platforms. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="689">He can actually connect at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">a much deeper level. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="691">And his website goes on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="691">further to say this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="693">If you actually got us website, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">he's got a great quote. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="695">He says, you should buy from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">us because of the fact that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">when you buy from us, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">get 91% of the money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="703">Only 9% actually goes to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">credit card payment people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="707">And this is really cool, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">this allows him to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">actually connect with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">his users, say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="711">hey, I'm a real person. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="712">I have a real job. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">And this is because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">of two factors, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1644">bandwidth and latency. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1645">Now, bandwidth is typically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1645">what you pay for when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1648">actually go to your internet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1648">service provider. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1649">They usually have some sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">package system, and they limit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1652">it based upon throttling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1652">all these other things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1654">But what they're talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1654">is buying bandwidth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1657">The second problem, latency, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">you actually can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1659">control that much. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1660">Latency, or the speed of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">latency, is actually limited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">by physics, which is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">limited by how fast light can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1667">travel over time &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">or over distance. </span></p>
