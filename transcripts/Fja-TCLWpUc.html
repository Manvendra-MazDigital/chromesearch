<h1>Getting started with apps for the Chrome Web Store</h1>

<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/Fja-TCLWpUc">youtu.be/Fja-TCLWpUc</a><div id="transcript"><p><span class="line" data-startTime="3">Hi, I’m Arne, from the Chrome Web Store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3">team. I’m here to talk about some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">reasons we started working on the concept </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">of web apps for Chrome, and the ways that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="11">you as a developer can get started writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="11">these apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="15">The idea for a web store grew out of an observation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">that the way the web works has changed significantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">in the past few years. New standards such </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">as HTML5 give developers more flexibility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">in the types of experiences the web can provide. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="25">The pace of browser development has also sped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">up, so these new features are shipped to end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">users a lot faster than they were in the past. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="36">Developers have used these new features to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">write increasingly sophisticated sites. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">the idea of a web site as a place to consume </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">text-based content has become out of date. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="46">Developers are writing websites to act as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">real-time email clients, listen to streaming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">music, and play multi-player games - functionality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">that is traditionally associated with desktop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">apps. Many of Google’s own services push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">the limits of what can be done on a web page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="60">Tools like Gmail, Docs and Maps are quintessential </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">web “apps” that use the browser as an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">application platform instead of a content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">renderer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="68">We believe that the web has reached a point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">where these kinds of apps are only going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">become more ubiquitous.  We wanted to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">the experience of launching an app quick and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">direct, just like a desktop application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="76">So we’ve retooled Chrome’s New Tab page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">to display a list of your most commonly used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">apps as a series of big beautiful icons, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">that getting to the apps you love is as quick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">as possible. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="90">A lot of the new HTML5 features like geolocation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">and notifications help make apps very powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">but at the same time require explicit permission </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">from the user. A complex app may need lots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">of these features, which leads to a bad experience, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">if the user has to click on a bunch of approval </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">boxes before being able to use the app. To </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">address this, we made apps require an explicit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">“install” flow.  When a user decides </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">to install an app, they will be presented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">with the permissions that the app requires </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">in an easy to understand list.  When they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">approve the permissions, then the app will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">be installed to and launched from the New </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">Tab page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="123">Finally, while we think Google search is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">best way to find sites on the web, we understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">that users use many more metrics when selecting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">apps to use. So we built the Chrome Web Store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">as a dynamic gallery. Users filter apps by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">category, read reviews and ratings and even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">get personalized recommendations of apps to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">try. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="143">The Chrome Web Store is integrated with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">Chrome browser, so it it easy to access directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">from the New Tab page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="150">It also offers an integration with Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">Checkout, so if an app requires payment to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">use, the buying process is straightforward, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">without the user needing to input a credit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">card for each purchase. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="158">One important point to note is that while </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">we added additional UI and functionality to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">support apps in Chrome, we didn’t add any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">additional proprietary APIs or technologies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">to learn. Web apps in the Chrome Web Store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">are built using the same standards-based tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">that you would use to create any other website. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="177">In fact, any website can be deployed as an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">app simply by filling out a simple manifest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">file and uploading it to the Web Store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="181">Apps that require payment can take advantage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">of open technologies such as OpenID and OAuth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">to interact with our license server, or they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">can use any other existing payment or user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">infrastructure if they wish. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="197">The key difference, then, is more about how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">a web app should be designed, than how it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">is built.  We expect web apps to deliver </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">a tight focus and a rich user experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="206"> In this sense a web app in the store should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">be more like a mobile application designed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">for a larger screen, rather than a packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">installable website.  And because apps can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">use all of the features supported by Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">Chrome, they can be fast, dynamic and powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">without having to worry about legacy compatibility. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="221">Hopefully this video has gotten you excited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">to try creating a web app of your own and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">posting it to the store. There’s an easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">learning curve to get started, and if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">already use a developer channel version of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">Chrome and have a text editor, you have all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">the software you need to get started. Just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">visit code.google.com/chrome/apps to read </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">tutorials and documentation on building apps. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="243">Happy coding! </span></p></div>
