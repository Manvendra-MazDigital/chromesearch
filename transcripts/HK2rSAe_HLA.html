<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2">Hi! My name is Colt MCAnlis, and I am a Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">Advocate for Native Client. In this video, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">I am going to explain how you can get started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">using Native Client to create applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="12">The first thing you need to do is get the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">SDK and run naclsdk update. This downloads </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">and unpacks the up-to-date tools, headers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">and libraries that you’ll need to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">Native Client applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="21">Then my recommendation is to become more familiar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">with Pepper. Pepper is a set of bindings that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">expose the power of the web platform to C </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">and C++, giving your program the same capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">that JavaScript has. You can start by running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">some of the examples and inspect their code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="36">Understanding the build process is also critical. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="42">Start by running the SCons builders, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">look at the output. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="46">Once you familiarized yourself with Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">Client’s basic architecture, then you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">ready to build your project. If you are porting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">or building your app from an existing code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">base, then you’ll need to make three key </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">changes: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">First you’ll need to make your C and C++ </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">source code portable; for that use only the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">portable dialect of C and C++. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="63">Second you will need to use the Pepper interfaces </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">to access resources like graphics, audio, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">and input devices. This step makes the resulting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">application OS-independent, because Pepper </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">is an OS-independent API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="78">Third if your application uses hardware accelerated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">graphics, you will need to adapt it to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">OpenGL ES 2.0. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="83">Once your project is done, then you need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">package it as a Chrome Web Store app - this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">way you will be able to reach more than 200 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">millions Chrome users. </span></p>
