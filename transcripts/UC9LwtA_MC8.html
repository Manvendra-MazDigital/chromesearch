<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/UC9LwtA_MC8">youtu.be/UC9LwtA_MC8</a><div id="transcript"><p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: All right. Can everybody hear </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3">me? Cool. Well, good morning and welcome to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">the third day of Google I/O. Thank you everybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">for coming to this. And I'm excited to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">so many bright faces here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="10">And this is the Chrome fireside chat. We try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">to do this every year as an opportunity for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">you guys, the developer community, to engage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">with us, the Chrome team. So today we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">a few product managers and a few engineering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">managers here today to take your questions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="25">If you look over on that screen, there is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">a URL there that you can go to which will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">bring you to that page that you see on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">left over there where you can submit questions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">and vote on questions. So that will automatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">refresh throughout the session, and I'll take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">questions from there and I'll alternate with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">questions from the audience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="46">And so there's two standing microphones, one's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">over there and one's over there. I would recommend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">actually moving close to the edges so that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">you have easy access to the microphones if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">you want to ask any questions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="59">So that's it. We have an hour. Let's start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">with some intros. Each of us will tell you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">our name and what we work on, and we will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">try to say something about either a recently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">launched product or feature that we're excited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">about or something that's coming up. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="75">So I'll start. My name is Jeff Chang, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">I'm a product manager on the Chrome browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="81">And I'm currently responsible for end user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">features and I also help coordinate the releases </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">that we do every six weeks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="88">And the recently launched feature which I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">the most excited about, which hopefully you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">heard about by now, is tab sync, the synchronizing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">of tabs across the many devices where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">use Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="103">We had previously already had the ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">to sync your bookmarks and settings and other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">stuff like that, but tab sync in particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">allows you to see all the tabs that you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">open on all of your other devices and open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">any of them at any time, which I think is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">really useful, especially across mobile and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">desktop. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="120">And the tab even includes the navigations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">history, so you're right back where you left. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="127">But that's me. And I'll pass it off to Alex </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">now. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="131"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: Cool. Hi. So my name is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">Alex Komoroske. I'm a product manager on Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">as well. I focus on the open Web platform, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">so all the technologies that Web developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">use to build cool apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="139">My favorite stuff &mdash; and if you saw my talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">on Wednesday this won't surprise you &mdash; is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">Web components. So Web components is a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">technology, a new standard that's being developed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="149">So relatively early stages, but it promises </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">to allow people to totally change the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">they architect their Web apps and be much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">more productive. So I truly believe this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">one of the technologies that four years from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">now we'll look back and say how did we build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">stuff without this? I'm really excited about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">the Web components in particular. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="168"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Hi, my name is Erik Kay. I'm an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">engineer on the Chrome team. Actually, I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">been with the Chrome team now for a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">long time, almost since it started, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">is actually getting close to six years ago, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">believe it or not. We were secret for almost </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">two years at the beginning. And so even though </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">we've only been out for about four years now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">it's been a long road at this point. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="198">Anyway, I've done everything from the auto </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">update system to Chrome extensions, and our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">app system, and I also now help lead the Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">Client effort and a few other things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="212">The things I'm most excited about &mdash; I'm actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">really excited about Web components too, Alex, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">also. I think that's pretty awesome. But selfishly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">the new stuff we're doing with apps I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">will really be a big deal for people who want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">to use Web technologies to do more advanced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">applications going forward. So I'm really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">excited to see what people are going to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">with that. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="232"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: Hi. My name is Ian Ellison-Taylor. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="237">I'm the director of product management for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">the Web platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="241">And I'm just realizing I probably should have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">sat at that end since we already covered a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">couple of my favorite features in Web components, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">and apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="252">I think just to echo Erik's comment, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">that what is coming with the new generation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">of apps is going to be a game changer. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">kind of teased it just a little bit in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">keynote. We tried not to really oversell it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">because it's very early days, but there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">a ton of very cool stuff coming there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="271">But just is to make Pavel's life worse and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">not repeat, probably the other thing &mdash; the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">other major area I'm really excited about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">that's coming up in the next sort of 12 months </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">is around all the tools work. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="285">We've got &mdash; I think Pavel showed some amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">stuff with our own dev tools in Chrome, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">if you also saw Adobe did a fantastic talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">on some of the work that they're doing around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">Brackets and Shadow. So &mdash; and they're doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">&mdash; have done some great work with Edge and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">designer focus tools for the Web platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="302">And then there are other lots of companies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">as well, Cloud 9 to name but one. So I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">with a big investment in tooling as well as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">on top of the platform we can make it much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">easier for people like you to build some amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">experiences. So I think that's really going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">to help. So I think that's pretty exciting. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="323"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Thank you. I'm Pavel Feldman, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">software engineer working on the developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="331">And the areas we are currently focusing on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">are better authoring so that you can develop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">Chrome within the tools, its memory. As the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">platform matures we see a lot more requests </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">on the memory. As your apps are running for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">days and weeks, you better make sure you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">no memory leaks. So we have a new heap profiler, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">we have new tools for native memory measurement, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">lots of stuff there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="357">The other area that is important for us is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">support for mobile. We are working on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">remote debugging for the mobile and as well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">as emulating mobile handsets on your desktop. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="369">We do support the &mdash; we've created the remote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">debugging protocol that we are happy to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">other big players using now around WebKit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="376">The other area that is important for us is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">the rendering smoothness, and you've seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">a couple of sessions on that yesterday. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">where we make sure your apps are buttery smooth. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="389">And we are happy to see more and more requests </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">there. And overall we are happy to see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">way the platform matures and the way you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">more and more demand in the tooling. >>Felix </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="401"><span class="speakerName">Lin</span>: I'm Felix Lin and I'm on the product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">team for Chrome OS. I spend most of my time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">working with hardware partners to bring Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">devices to markets. I guess I'm most excited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">about the recent Samsung Chromebook and Chromebox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">that were just released, and the close working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">relationship over the past couple of years </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">we've developed with Intel and Samsung and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">Qualcomm and all the other folks in the PC </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">ecosystem building devices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="431">I'm a huge fan of Chrome, as you can imagine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="437">I love all the things these guys have built, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">but what we're really trying to do with Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">OS is fully integrate Chrome directly with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">the hardware and deliver the best possible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">experience in a fully integrated package. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="448">And so the benefit of Chromebooks and Chromeboxes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">and other devices is that, you know, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">we can control the entire stack all the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">down to the hardware, we can deliver the best </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">possible experience for Chrome and the Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">on any hardware that people have. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="466">And so it's not about replacing PC's or replacing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="471">other devices, but for the people who are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="471">spending more and more time on the Web, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">we want to do is just deliver an awesome, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">magical experience for all the rich, immersive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">experiences that you guys are building for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">the Web. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="485"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Great. All right. So now we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">open for questions. Feel free to walk up to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">any of the microphones and ask or otherwise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">we will trade off with the &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="498"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: We'll take precedent for the people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="498">who actually take some bravery and walk to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="507">the mic. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="507">[Laughter]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="507"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: We'll just intersperse the ones </span><span class="line" data-startTime="507">from moderator here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="511"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: All right. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="511"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi. Good morning. I've got a question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">We're seeing yesterday that it's possible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">to open tabs on other devices, and sometimes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">if you're like left at home or you have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">devices &mdash; the tabs open there and you open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">on a mobile device, will it be possible to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">close the tabs that are home because I read </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">it on the mobile device, it's done, the task </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">is done? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="538"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Yeah, I want that, too. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="538"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: So the question was it's great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">that you can open tabs that are on other devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">from your other devices, but what about closing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">them as well? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">That's a really interesting feature request. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">We'll have to think about that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">It might be possible if Chrome is running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">on that device, but if that device has already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">been shut down, obviously you couldn't do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">it immediately. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="558"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: I think we could do it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="560"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Maybe we could &mdash; maybe we could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">figure something out there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">But yeah, I imagine that could be useful. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">But yeah, when we started designing that feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">we talked about tab sync, I think we realized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">pretty quickly on that you wouldn't want the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">exact same set of tabs duplicated everywhere. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">So that's not the way it works. It's more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">or less a dashboard almost. You can see all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">of the devices you have, what's open on each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">one and you just pick and choose what you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">want. But we'll definitely keep that in mind. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="591"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Great, thank you. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">Audience member: +1! </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="591"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Can I make a question on Chrome OS? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="591"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="595"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: What's the road map on Chrome OS and VPN? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">Sometimes to configure Chrome OS to VPN's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="601">and getting to the site of a network it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="601">been a little bit of a hassle. >>Felix Lin: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="606">So Chrome OS today already supports VPN's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="606">and we're doing a ton of work through the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">management console to enable I.T. administrators </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">to centrally manage an entire fleet of devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">quickly and easily to support different authentication </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">schemes, different access control mechanisms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">and all that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="625"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Looks like we have another megaphone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="631">question over here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="631"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi. I'm wondering if anything is in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">works to improve drag and drop interoperability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">between Web apps. So A couple of years ago </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">we had the ability to do file drag and drop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">in HTML5 and it was fantastic and I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">love to see sort of the next evolution so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">I could, for instance, be in Gmail and just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">drag an attachment out of a message over to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">another application that can do something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">with that file and have that application be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">able to sort of interact with Gmail to pull </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">in the information it needs and do something, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">or vice versa, drag out of an application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">on to a Gmail, et cetera. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="666"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So that's a great use case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">And there isn't exactly precisely a standard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">respect being developed to do precisely what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">you're asking for, but something that does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">something sort of similar is Web Intents, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">which is a spec that we're driving that allows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">applications to say I have an attach or whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">and allow the users to pick which application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">they would like to sort of service that request </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">with. So theoretically you could have a loose </span><span class="line" data-startTime="692">coupling between Gmail and any other Web app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="692">that would want to view those images or what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">you have. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">But that's a good point that users are familiar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">with drag and drop and it makes sense to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">able to drag and drop these things between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">tabs, but that's not something that's currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">on the roadmap. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="709"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Yeah. I just want to emphasize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">that last point, is loose coupling. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">So Web Intents is another one of these really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">exciting Web technologies that I think is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">going to change the Web in a year. That you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">going to look and say, oh, my God, how did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">we interact without this? Because the idea </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">is that now Gmail can interact with a whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">host of Web apps that it knows nothing about. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">It didn't have to be performed with the knowledge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">that Oh, I want to save this attachment to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">Dropbox or G Drive or whatever else or that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">I want to share this picture with Twitter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">or Google+ or whatever else. That it's up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">to you in the apps that are provided. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">just that fact that we can now have these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">websites interoperate without having to hard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">code relationships between them I think is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">going to be a game changer. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="754"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Cool. Any other megaphone questions? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">All right. Let's take one from the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">moderator page. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">So offline it's pretty important for the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">OS story. What features are missing from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">Web platform that would help drive offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">application uses? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="771"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: I'll take a stab at this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">one. There already are a suite of technologies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">in the Web platform that allow you to do offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">things. You've got things like Local Storage, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">you have app cache, Index DB and others. They </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">aren't necessarily a joy to use right now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">but they do exist as alternatives to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">upon. The file API is a great &mdash; another great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">example. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="795">But I would argue actually that the way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">think about really driving offline application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">usage is the way you develop your applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="803">So if you develop your application with an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="803">always on server &mdash; always connected through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">a server mindset, you're going to approach </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">it in certain ways and architect your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">in certain ways. And then when you try to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">layer on offline it can be pretty challenging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">because you don't have that server connection </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">all the time. So actually orienting yourself </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">as a developer and saying I'm going to start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">at the beginning working in this world where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">I don't know if I have internet connection, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">it sort of forces you actually to pivot your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">thinking and to design your apps in a different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">way. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="833">And that's a great thing about the new &mdash; the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">next evolution of Chrome apps is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">they encourage you as a developer to start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">from this world where you are sort of offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">by default, and connecting to the server is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">almost an exception. So that really orients </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">you to sort of the architecture app in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">way that really works for offline. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="852"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Right. So thanks for the shout-out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">to the Chrome apps, but the &mdash; we really want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="859">to emphasize that this is one of these key </span><span class="line" data-startTime="859">architectural things that we are building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">in from the beginning for Chrome apps is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">say that apps should be written to be offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">by default and we're doing a lot of things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">built in to them to make it possible to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">it easy for you to not get &mdash; you know, get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">your app into a bad state. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="876">One of the interesting things about offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">is people sort of get hung up on, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="880">Oh, well, I've got connectivity everywhere. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="880">Why do we need offline? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">And it's because offline isn't such a straightforward </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">thing. It's not a question of am I on an airplane </span><span class="line" data-startTime="892">with no connectivity? It's, Oh, well, sometimes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="892">I've got spotty connectivity on my cell network </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">or other times I'm at a trade show with 5,000 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">people all using the same Wi-Fi, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">connection or other times I'm at a hotel with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">a captive proxy or, you know &mdash; there's &mdash; offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="914">is &mdash; has a wide spectrum actually, and making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="914">your apps that is resistant, resilient to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="920">these network conditions takes a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="920">of forethought. You have to build app, assume </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">that it's offline and basically you're operating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">on local data and syncing with the server. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="930">And all these features that Alex was talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">about with local storage, operating on that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">local data, having your code running locally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">to begin with and then synchronizing the server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">and as you get network connectivity is sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">of the key to making offline work. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="948"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: All right. The computer that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">was projecting the URL for the questions just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">died and won't start up. So we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">try to replace that, but hopefully we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">a pretty good queue of Google moderator questions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">there and audience questions, so let's keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="967">going. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="967"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Morning. So Chrome is a leader of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="971">HTML5 standard, no doubt. I was curious on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="971">the roadmap for the mobile Android version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="977">of Chrome, when that would kind of catch up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="977">to the current platform. Specifically in my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">case for the WebGL implementation, being that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">that's super hard in Tegra and Intel chipsets, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">but I just wondered if it was on the roadmap </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">and where that might fall. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="993"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: Is anyone from that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">team here? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="995">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="995"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: Oh, is there someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">in the back? Oh, yes. Oh, Mrs. Smith, good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">Lord! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">Yes, Grace, come down and maybe answer this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">question, otherwise I'll make up something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1008">like it will be there next week, maybe Tuesday. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1008"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yeah. [Indiscernible] is also here. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">So WebGL we are under development behind the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">flags. There's a performance issue that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1018">just mentioned and then there's a potential </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1018">DOS attack. So we try to work with like OEM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">device drivers to try to address these problems. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1026"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: The high level strategy, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1031">of course, is that all these features end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1031">up on mobile. There's implementation issues, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1036">and also recognizing that the unique power </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1036">management requirements make it a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">tricky, but generally when we do new features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">in the Web platform we're thinking about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1048">mobile scenarios. Almost &mdash; I would say first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1048">and foremost generally. We worry a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">bit less about the desktop because that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">an easier scenario. So pretty much everything. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">I can't think of anything off the top of my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">head that we're not thinking about being in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1062">mobile sooner or later. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1062">So hopefully we'll &mdash; that lag between desktop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">and mobile will get shorter and shorter. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1069"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: So there's also &mdash; there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">a little bit of this temporary lag, but the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">fact that Chrome for Android is relatively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1081">new. So we're still going through and making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1081">sure we get all those pieces that we worked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">on to make Chrome for Android work back into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">Chrome. So that process takes a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">of time, which is why it takes a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">for us to catch up to where desktop Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">is right now, but that's a temporary problem. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">So there's a long-term problem of some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">these features that you have to make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">you design it in the mobile &mdash; to work well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">in mobile use case and other ones that it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">just takes awhile for us to catch up to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">desktop. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1107"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Okay. Next question from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">moderator page is, OSX 10.8 has a power nap </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">feature that keeps various bits of a user's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">data synced while the machine is suspended, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">email, et cetera. Any plans for such a feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">in Chrome OS? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">Felix, do you want to try to take this one? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">I guess, you can look at it on that screen, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">too. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">Since that machine is broken anyway, maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">we can get that screen mirrored on that screen. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1144"><span class="speakerName">Felix Lin</span>: So this is definitely a feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">that we're looking at. I don't know exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">when we'll have this feature in Chrome OS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1150">Certainly as we work with Intel and other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">hardware partners, these types of capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">are much easier for us to implement because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1162">we have full knowledge of the hardware that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1162">running in these systems and we can actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1166">design them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1166">The great thing about Chrome OS, though, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">that you could buy a machine today and if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">that machine has the capability at all to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">make this possible, we'll roll out that feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">and you will get it automatically. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">So a lot of these features, when we spec the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">minimum requirements for Chrome OS boxes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">a lot of what we're doing is looking forward </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">and making sure that we've got the kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1192">head room that we need to be able to add new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1192">features, new capabilities, even though what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">we release on any given day may not include </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">this full set of capabilities. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1200"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: I should point out as well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">this basic feature, this basic request, makes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">sense in a lot of different scenarios. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">makes sense, especially on mobile as well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1210">where you don't know, you don't want to constantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1210">have your radio powered up. There's also been, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1215">with these event pages. Generally we're moving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1215">towards a model where it's possible for Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1222">apps to sort of allow Chrome to wake them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1222">up, do a little bit of work, put them back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">to sleep in response to events. That's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">basically the core of what power nap is doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1231">as well. So we are looking into this on multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1231">fronts. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">So while Jeff is figuring that out, I'll move </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">on to the next one. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">Okay. Will I ever be able to run Chrome OS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">on a tablet, maybe even a Nexus 7 tablet? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1249"><span class="speakerName">Felix Lin</span>: That's a great question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1257"><span class="speakerName">Felix Lin</span>: Um, Chrome OS was really designed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1257">to run on a variety of form factors, so there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">nothing about Chrome OS that says that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">can't run on a tablet or pick your device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">form factor. The first device that we focused </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">on, because of the complexity of use case, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1274">is the calm shell where we just bring full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1274">capabilities of Chrome to bear. You know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1281">today, Google's OS for tablets is Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1281">and we are able to bring all of the capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">of Chrome to Android for Jelly Bean and Ice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">Cream Sandwich. We're working on creating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1295">a completely seamless, coherent experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1295">across all devices, regardless of whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">the underlying OS happens to be Android or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">Chrome OS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1303">So from the user standpoint, whether you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1303">buying content from the play store or whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1309">you are running an app, our goal is to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1309">it such that you don't have to worry about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">whether it's actually Android or Chrome OS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">running on that tablet; we want that to work. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1320"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Next. How will the two operating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1320">systems, Android and Chrome OS, eventually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">converge? Yeah, we get asked &mdash; we've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">asked about this in the past, you know, one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1334">thing to keep in mind is that Chrome OS has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1334">the goal of designing an end-to-end computing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">experience that &mdash; that embodies kind of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">same core principles as Chrome does, the security, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1345">and, you know, over time we've been thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1345">about what parts of the technologies between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1350">those two makes sense to integrate, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1350">We are very happy to say that Chrome for Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1355">came out of beta this week, so Chrome for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1355">Android is now stable. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">And maybe Felix you have some other comments </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">on this or &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1362"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Well, I can add a few things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1362">I mean, one thing is that you'll see, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1367">you are going to see more and more convergence </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1367">over time. You know, we &mdash; first off just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">bringing Chrome, you know, to Android was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">sort of the first big step. But there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">many places where we &mdash; where we can integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">more. First off, getting the same set of apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1385">running, using the same cloud infrastructure. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1385">But I think the opportunities doing some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1392">the &mdash; I think the Chrome-to-phone stuff that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1392">we had before, we're looking to &mdash; to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">&mdash; to leverage a lot of the same infrastructure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">and to have more and more integration over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1401">time. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1401"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: All right. Any other microphone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">questions? Don't be shy. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">Any plans for a messaging platform inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">of Chrome or Chrome OS, similar to C2DM or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">iOS notifications, which I believe are coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1420">to the desktop? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1420"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: So we actually do have some &mdash; effectively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1426">with the sync we have a notification system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1426">built into Chrome and into Chrome OS and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1432">turns out that behind the scenes a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1432">the, you know, infrastructure is very similar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">and, again, as I said, that we're looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">to unify some of the basic infrastructure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1442">that we share across Android and Chrome. I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1442">would expect to see our messaging systems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1447">converge as well. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1447"><span class="speakerName">Alex Komoroske</span>: You can imagine the solution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">wouldn't just have to be about messaging, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">per se. It could be about notifications, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">different apps could decide different things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">that were worthwhile to do. In fact, actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1460">in the meet the Web platform video series </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1460">we showed off a mock of what that could look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1466">like. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1466"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Cool. All right, audience question. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1470"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: A question about Chrome apps. What's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">plan to get Chrome apps for Chrome on Android, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">and how is it going to work? Is it going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">the Chrome Web store, it's going to a (indiscernible) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">to play? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1480"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Okay. Let's see, how do we start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1484">with this? First off, you know, it's a common </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1484">question that we get about what's our plan </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1490">for getting, you know, Chrome apps to mobile. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1490">So you heard Sundar say at the keynote, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">said the other day at the apps talk we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">intending to get Chrome apps to mobile, basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">everywhere that we have Chrome. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">Now how are we going to do that? The details </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1506">of that? The timing of that? You know, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1506">too early to say. I can say that we're looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">for your feedback. We want to know from you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">what you want. What are the most important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1516">features that you want to see brought to mobile? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1516">And just one last little plug, we are hiring. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1523">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1523"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: So if you want to help make this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1526">happen, you know &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1526"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Cool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1528"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Exactly. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1528"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Cool, another audience question. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1534"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Also about Chrome apps, you launched them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1534">from within Chrome but with a new version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1538">that will act a lot like they are native to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1538">the platform. Any thoughts about setting them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">up so you would be able to launch them as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">if they were a native app? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1545"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Absolutely. That's one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1545">key features of the next evolution of Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1550">apps here is that we are pulling them outside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1550">of the browser. It's not just that they have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1555">standalone Windows; it's that the way that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1555">you launch them will be without even necessarily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">having to have Chrome running. So basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">you will just launch them from the native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">desktop. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1564"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: When will we have private key SSH? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1572"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Right. So I know that the engineers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1572">working on that pretty &mdash; on the SSH thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1580">for Chrome OS is a top feature request. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1580">I know that it's going to come. I don't know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1586">what the timeline is. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1586"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: All right. Looks like we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">got someone walking up to the microphone. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">Go ahead. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1600"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Why was the change to Aura made? I know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">when the Chrome was initially announced, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">launch video mentioned that you didn't even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">have a desktop background. And the change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1611">on &mdash; to Aura in the newer version of Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1611">OS did make it a lot more like a desktop operating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1617">system. What was the decision, why did that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1617">happen? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1620"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: It was 99% user feedback. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1620">I mean &mdash; I think when we launched Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">OS in the particular UI model, it was something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">of an experiment. It was something that no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">one had ever done before. We said that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">were going to update it based on user feedback. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1639">And obviously I think Sundar made the point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1639">about performance improvements and feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1644">improvements, but people just gave us their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1644">feedback that they wanted it to be a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1648">bit more like a &mdash; you know, a "traditional" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1648">OS and particularly I think that model, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">mean this is just for me personally &mdash; I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">let Felix talk a little bit. For me personally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1659">the tab model I think worked really well on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1659">the smaller screen. But once you get to sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1667">of Chromebox style and you're on a large monitor, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1667">that's &mdash; that single large window gets a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">little weird, you know. It's like you get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">a huge crick in your neck going from one side </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">of the screen to the other. So being able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">to like open multiple windows, switch between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">&mdash; then multi-tasking, now I've got three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">or four things going on at once, I want a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">quick way to switch between them. There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">just a use case that seemed pretty important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1694">And that you can very easily configure it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">so it behaves like it used to if you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">like that. Then you just run everything full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">screen, keep everything in a tab. So if you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1704">in that model, you don't really lose anything, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1704">but if you want something a little bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1709">traditional with multiple windows, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1709">do that, too. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1712"><span class="speakerName">Felix Lin</span>: I think the biggest benefit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1712">having a windowing system is that people can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">do more than one thing at one time, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">So a very, very common use case is writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1722">an email and checking your calendar, if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1722">have to flip between tabs and you only have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">one pane, it's a pretty miserable experience. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">Also, as &mdash; as Ian was mentioning, you know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">with the Chromebox we are now able to deliver </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">an experience on dual 30-inch monitors, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1738">you have got a huge desktop having one full-screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1738">window is not a great use of space. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1744"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Also, one other kind of funny </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1744">thing that we discovered by having a full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1750">screen browser, which is there's sort of an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1750">interesting psychological effect for users. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">So users have sort of preconceived notions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">of what a browser can and can't do, it turns </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1761">out. And so they see tabs, they see an address </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1761">bar, they see a back button and they immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1767">assume, oh, well it's, you know, it's only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1767">a Web page, it can't do everything an app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1771">can do. Or it certainly can't run offline, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1771">so there's sort of these interesting things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1777">that sort of get in the way just by having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1777">it there. And as we move to more focus on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1782">apps within Chrome OS and wanting to bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1782">apps fronts and center, it was important to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">pull those out of the browser and really give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">them their own windows. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1790"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: That actually reminds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1790">me since I tease this on Twitter about there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1793">being an Easter egg. It reminds me of one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1793">of them. So Kan, if you saw the keynote yesterday, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">Kan did the sort of the spinning window thing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">so that's in Chrome OS. So that wasn't just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1803">something we rigged up for the keynote. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1803">You can &mdash; it shows the power of the window </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1808">manager, so one of the keys is very obvious. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1808"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Control alt and then refresh button or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1814">something like that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1814"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: Sorry, what was that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1815"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Isn't it like control alt and then the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">refresh button? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1818"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: It may or may not be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1818">that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1820"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I have done it before. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">Ian Ellison-Taylor:. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">[ Laughter ] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">You give it away. But there's another &mdash; another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">Easter egg that was in the keynote as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">I don't know if anyone spotted that one, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">I'll maybe talk about that later, if the questions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">are good enough. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1837"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Go ahead. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1837"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yeah, so the current Chromebook runs on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1846">Intel or Celeron, but all of your Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1846">devices currently run on ARM, video, Qualcomm, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1854">TI, respectively, if you're ever going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1854">get to a point in the future where you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1858">going to be able to dual boot a device, whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1858">it be a tablet or a laptop, desktop, or even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">a smart phone down the road, into either Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">OS or Android, you have to get on the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1868">CPU hardware platform, is there anything inherent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1868">that makes it difficult for Chrome OS to run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">on say an ARM chip or is this just a matter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">of timing that this is basically something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">that you should expect at some undescript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">point down the road? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1883"><span class="speakerName">Felix Lin</span>: I think &mdash; we can't talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1883">any future products obviously. But there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1889">nothing about Chrome OS that limits it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1889">a particular processor architecture. Completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1896">open source. In fact, many of the ARM vendors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1896">have brought Chrome OS up on different ARM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">SOCs, and it's really a matter of, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">timing and price point and, you know, a variety </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1910">of other things with respect to, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1910">packaging a product and bringing it to commercial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1916">release. So I don't &mdash; you know, basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1916">there's nothing holding anybody back. Other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">than, you know, commitment to ship the product. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1924"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: There is one thing that I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1928">toss out. Which is it's not a limitation of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1928">Chrome OS. It's more just sort of what our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">chip sets have been building &mdash; what the ARM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">chip sets and manufacturers have been building, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1940">so their main focus is on phones and now tablets, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1940">and what's interesting is that phones and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">tablets have smaller screens. And it turns </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">out that &mdash; that the thing that you need that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">one of the biggest performance bottlenecks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">on computers in general is memory bandwidth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1958">between the CPU and the display architecture. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1958">And the bigger the screen, the more memory </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">bandwidth that you need. Turns outs the smaller </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">the screen, the less you need, right, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1967">know, conversely. So it's an optimization </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1967">that you can do to make it use less power, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1973">to be cheaper and that sort of a thing. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1973">many of the ARM chip sets are designed to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">really be only efficient up to a certain screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">size. So it turns out, this is one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">things that held ARM back getting to the desktop, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">bigger monitors, you know, hi-res. But now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1988">as tablets have had &mdash; now get an increased </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1988">density, increased size, increased number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1993">of pixels, they've had to solve those same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1993">memory bandwidth problems. So I think we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">right in the cusp of being able to see really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">awesome desktop and laptop ARM form factors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">coming and you will see it probably for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">variety of systems. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2007"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Thank you, next question. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2007">moderator page. Speaking of sync, any plan </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2015">for app syncing as well, with an API that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2015">would allow apps to sync their data as well? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2019"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: So, yes. That already exists. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2019">There's an extension API people can start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2028">playing with today, storage API, Chrome.storage.sync, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2028">basically it's a simple key value store so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2037">you can sort of maintain your state and your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2037">preferences and that sort of a thing. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2042">an easy way to sort of move app and extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2042">settings from &mdash; from machine to machine. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">We have much more planned for doing more cloud-based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">storage and making APIs available to apps. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2055"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: And obviously there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">a quick plug for our colleagues on drive that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2061">for applications to be able to store their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2061">application, the user data, that's obviously </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2066">one of the goals for drive and getting drive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2066">onto lots of devices. So you get sort of both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2071">&mdash; both parts of the equation, your settings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2071">and your data that can travel with you. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">sync is a huge part of the overall strategy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">about what we think is really interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2080">about having lots of devices, but a Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2080">experience on one of them. So I think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">pretty key. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2084"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Okay. So regarding Chrome OS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2091">and the enterprise, what plans do you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2091">for enhancing the management and performance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2094">of Cloud Print, particularly around management </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2094">of over 1,000 printers at a given company? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">I know that in Chrome, we don't usually talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">about version numbers, but Chrome 20 stable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">&mdash; just went to the stable channel this past </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">week. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2116">Actually, I take that back. I'm mixing up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">my versions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2119">We are always managing multiple releases at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2119">the same time, so we have four different channels, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2122">I'm actually thinking about 21, 21 I know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2122">has Cloud Printing more directly integrated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">into the Chrome's print dialogue itself, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">it's easier to find your printers more easily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">when you are printing. And know that that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">dialogue has a search box that you can search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2136">across all of the printers that are available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2136">to you. So I hope that's &mdash; that the UI team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">has considered the issue of &mdash; of when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">have lots of printers there, although I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2146">this question might be around more from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2146">enterprise. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2149"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: Yeah. Actually, I wonder </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2149">if any here &mdash; if they have any from Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">Print here. They have a session today, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">if there's no one from the cloud print team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2157">right here, definitely go to that session </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2157">and ask them if they have done a lot of work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2161">there. So they can probably answer the question. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2161"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Cloud Print is actually the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2164">last session in this room today, I think. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2164"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Actually, just so you know, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2169">mean one of the big strengths that we've seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2169">with &mdash; with Chromebooks and Chrome OS has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2173">been enterprise management. This ability to, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2173">you know, drop in, you know, a thousand new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2181">devices and just hand them out. And you not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2181">have to image them and configure them on a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2186">per user basis and deploy a whole bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2186">stuff to them is one of the key strengths </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">we see of Chrome OS. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">And so we've been investing pretty heavily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2195">in the enterprise management console to really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2195">make that better. So if there's any limitations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2200">on that, we want to hear about it. File bugs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2200">you know, talk to us. Because we think that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2207">this is an area that we can really own. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2207"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Yeah, we have an audience question. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2216"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So I came in a little bit late, I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2216">know if you addressed this yet, but I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">curious about what's the state of eating your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">own dogfood within Google? If you could talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2224">about the transition of getting people to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2224">be full-time Chromebook users instead of regular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">desktop users. Are people doing that? How </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">successful is it? What kind of experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2235">have you had? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2235"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Sure, yeah. The question is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2238">asking, you know, about the phrase eating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2238">our own dogfood, which means using our own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2242">products as they are being developed at Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2242">I can say for sure for Chrome browser, I definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">eat my own dogfood. I run Canary, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">the nightly auto update, built side-by-side </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">with the beta installation on my machine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2253">So I actually use Canary every day, so I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2260">stay with the latest engineering. But I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2260">recommend that to normal folks. It's painful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2266">at times. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2266">And in terms of Chromebooks, I certainly carry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">around my Chromebook with me. I have it right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">over there and I use it and it's really convenient </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">when I'm going to meetings and stuff, especially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">when I want to get out an email in like 60 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2279">seconds or something. Open it up on my lid, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2279">press the button and be able to fire off the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">email and close my lid within 30 seconds while, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">you know, like my other Windows laptop might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">be churning away on the anti-virus thing for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">like a minute because Google corporate makes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">us run anti-virus on them. So, yeah, we definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">see that a lot around the office. But I do, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2300">you know, use multiple devices and multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2300">operating systems. And for Canary on Windows, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2306">I run that, because I want to get the latest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2306">code from our engineers as soon as possible. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2310"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Do you have anyone going cold turkey, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2310">just Chrome OS exclusively? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2313"><span class="speakerName">Felix Lin</span>: I can tell you that the dogfooders </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2313">at Google who are using Chrome OS have skyrocketed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2320">since we released the latest Chromebooks running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2320">on Intel Corp. You know the great thing about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2325">Google &mdash; two things, right? We have access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2325">to whatever computer we want. If you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2331">a Macbook Air or Macbook Pro, whatever high-end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2331">system you want, you can have it. If you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2336">a Chromebook, you can have it. We don't force </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2336">anybody to dogfood Chrome OS, so everybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2343">who is using Chrome OS uses it by choice, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2343">and when you think about it, the fact that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2348">you see people, more and more Googlers who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2348">have their pick of any hardware that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2353">want walking around with Chromebooks, typically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2353">which cost often a fraction of what they could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2359">be spending, it's pretty remarkable. I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2359">tell you that with the latest Chromeboxes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2369">and the latest Chromebooks, these devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2369">are just completely hassle free, battery life, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2379">power management, superb, you know, even the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2379">&mdash; the first generation Chromebook, just because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2386">of the fact that we have so many existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2386">customers on older hardware and the fact that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2391">we're constantly updating even older hardware </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2391">with newer releases of Chrome OS, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2398">I switch devices continuously, and so yesterday </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2398">during a keynote when you saw Brian talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2404">the fact that, you know, he's got 7 or 8 different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2404">machines and he just walks from one machine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2408">to the next, he doesn't carry a single machine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2408">he has to worry about, you know, that is all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2412">possible because of Chrome and Chrome OS. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2412">You know, when you're using a machine which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2420">is a year old and you pick it up one day, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2420">and it's running 30% faster than the day before, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2425">because you've got the auto update pushed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2425">to you, it's really noticeable, and users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2430">really love it, and so even today, even though </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2430">I've got, you know, you know, the latest Samsung </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2440">Chromebook, when I switch to the device that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2440">I've been using for over a year, I really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2445">don't notice much of a performance difference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2445">for most of the things that I do. I'll notice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2449">some things for, you know, high-end video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2449">and things like that, but the device is completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">usable, it's just great. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2455"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: So let me give you another perspective. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2460">I do use my Chromebook exclusively as my laptop, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">I have to use a different laptop, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2467">in engineering we to test on a bunch of different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2467">platforms, but I do live on my Chromebook, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2472">and it's pretty common now within Google especially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2472">with the hardware, I'll say that the IT staff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2478">within Google, you know, loves it and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2478">want more people to switch over, as soon as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2485">they can, and Google &mdash; Googlers are a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2485">demanding audience. It turns out that, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2493">Felix said, they can use whatever hardware </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2493">they want, and &mdash; and a lot of them are doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2498">heavy-duty development tasks and that sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2498">of thing, and so making hardware that is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2502">to be good enough for the majority of Googlers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2502">to actually get their job done is a tall task, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2507">and the biggest bit of feedback that we heard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2507">early on was that for Googlers the previous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2512">generation of hardware wasn't quite powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2512">enough. And now the feedback that we've gotten </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2518">from people, is like, wow, this is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2518">&mdash; this has crossed the line and it's great, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2524">it's easy, and totally what they want. Now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2524">they want more of course and so we're working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2530">to make &mdash; build even more powerful machines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2530">and a wider variety of form factors, and trust </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2536">us when we say that Googlers are some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2536">most demanding audience out there, and &mdash; but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2540">the rate that they're growing and they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2540">selecting in and using it themselves is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2545">through the roof. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2545"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: It is a great idea to have kind of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2548">computer as like an appliance or kiosk, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2548">I feel very nervous if I have anything on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2553">a single machine, that is my only copy, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2553">like moving everything to the cloud, just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2558">being able to &mdash; but I know that there's lots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2558">of little, you know, dusty corners of our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2563">lives where they're not all, you know, able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2563">to be pushed to the cloud on Chrome OS yet, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2568">so it's nice that you guys are kind of filling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2568">in those holes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2571"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: That's a great point. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2571">I'm the same way. Since I don't do development, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2576">I'm 99% &mdash; 99.9% of my time is spent on a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2576">Chromebook, and mostly that &mdash; honestly it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">about I'm old and I need a keyboard, I love </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">tablets, but I spend all my time in e-mail, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2589">I just need to be able to type on a real keyboard, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2589">but I love the battery life, that sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2593">8, 9 hours, I can get through the day and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2593">I don't have to carry the little power brick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2597">around, so the battery life thing is huge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2597">for me when I'm running around campus. Another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2603">thing that's really nice about Google, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2603">I bounce between different offices, I'll often </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2607">not carry a machine with me, and I'll go to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2607">the other office, we have these little tech </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2612">stop places and I can grab a Chromebook from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2612">tech stop, I just log in, carry on from where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2617">I left off, and then I just hand it back at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2617">the end of the day, and I just don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2621">to travel with anything, so when I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2621">through security, and, you know, just everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2625">gets so much easier when I can just pick up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2625">that machine, log in, carry on, hand it back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2630">and not worry, like what did I leave on that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2630">machine? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2631">What was I doing? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2631">Did I do anything weird today? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2636">So for me, that's a hugely important use case, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2636">and I think we'll see more of that as time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2641">goes on. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2641"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2642"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Let's take a question from this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2642">side. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2646"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: My question is on moderator but it seems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2646">to have dropped off. I just want to know about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2650">international availability of Chrome OS devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2650">particularly the new Samsung Chromebook, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2656">I'm from New Zealand and, yeah, we just don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2656">have access to them there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2663"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: What's the international </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2663">access for Chromebooks, particularly the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2669">one. Particularly New Zealand? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2669"><span class="speakerName">Felix Lin</span>: So the new Chromebooks are currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2675">available in US and UK. We're looking at getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2675">them certified in more countries as quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2681">as possible, but, you know, as with all things, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2681">it's a matter of just figuring out where the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2689">demand is and how to role out in more countries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2689">and get the certifications. You know, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2694">demand for the new Chromebooks, i think, have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2694">greatly exceeded the expectations and so, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2701">again, it's just a matter of time, but we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2701">working on getting it out there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2706"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2706"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: All right. Back to this &mdash; actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2710">I'll go ahead and let's do a couple of these. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2710">At least one of these. How far is Web GL support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2717">for mobile versions of Chrome? I think we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2717">already answered that earlier up at the microphone. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2722">Next question here is about Chrome on iOS. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2722">So for you guys in here, we launched Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2726">on iOS yesterday, we actually it's like the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2726">number one ranked in the app store now, right? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2734"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: Yeah, Chrome on iOS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2734">was number one, and drive on iOS was number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2738">two. We'll see how long that lasts. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2738"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: So we're happy that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2742">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2742"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2745"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: We are definitely very happy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2745">that we were able to get that out to you guys, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2751">especially with the think store we've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2751">telling, it's very important that we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2756">Chrome available on as many platforms as possible. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2756">In terms of how Chrome runs on iOS, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2762">we obviously have to follow Apple's technical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2762">specifications there, so in terms of the actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2767">Web content it does use the UR WebView. I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2767">don't know if anyone else has any comments </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2773">there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2773"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: So there's two things: You have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2778">to think about performance on a number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2778">different axis, right? So one is how long </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2782">does it take &mdash; how fast is it to just get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2782">around and get your work done and do stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">like that and then the second thing is there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">raw compute performance or rendering performance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2790">within the page. I guess you could count those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2790">as three areas. So on the compute &mdash; on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2796">pure compute side of things, like if you were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2796">to download just a JavaScript benchmark, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2801">limited by what Apple provides us in that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2801">they don't allow you to run your own jitted, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2806">you know, JavaScript engine. They don't allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2806">you to provide your own rendering &mdash; you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2814">Web rendering engine, it's just not allowed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2814">by the terms of service, and so we have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2818">use UI WebView, and the UI WebView is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2818">more restrictive than what's in Safari. Even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2824">though it's some of the own code, they actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2824">turn off some features. And one of the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2828">they turn off is the use of the JIT in their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2828">JavaScript engine, so that slows down heavy-duty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2835">JavaScript things. The second thing it does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2835">is it affects some of the GPU acceleration, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2842">how that interoperates. So we have some limitations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2842">there, so if you wanted to do just sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2846">the raw how fast is this particular page spinning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2846">in a loop doing stuff, we aren't going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2852">be as fast as we are on other platforms just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2852">due to limitations; however, the good news </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">is is that that's not the entire story. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">usability, you know, in terms of how long </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2862">does it take you to get from point A to point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2862">B is how much we predict what you're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2869">to type, that helps with sync, your usage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2869">patterns, the Omni box, how we're able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2874">pre-fetch &mdash; guess what you're able to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2874">using our pre-rendering and some of our DNS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2881">pre-fetching stuff. We have a lot of tricks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2881">within Chrome beyond just the JavaScript engine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2886">and what we're doing inside the Web rendering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2886">engine. So actually if you read some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2893">reviews that are floating around out there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2893">if you see the ones that load up a benchmark </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2897">and compare them AB, you'll see that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2897">slower. If you see the ones that try to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2902">it and say I navigated to the following three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2902">sites and time that, you'll see that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2907">actually way faster, that some people are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2907">getting things done twice as fast. Getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2911">to their web pages, so if what you're doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2911">is surfing and navigating around, actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2916">I think you'll find Chrome on iOS is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2916">fast. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2918"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Yeah, for me just the fact that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2918">all my favorite websites all ready auto complete. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2922">It just helps a ton, and for me I use a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2922">of tabs. I tend to open a lot of tabs in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2929">background when I'm reading stuff, like read </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2929">it or something. Being able to flip through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2934">really easy, switch through them is a huge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2934">usability improvement for me. All right. Go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2941">ahead. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2941"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: On a similar note, one of the things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2944">makes Chrome so much more fast than anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2944">else is the extensions, and in particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2949">for me, the Omni box extension capability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2949">of making completion work. When are you considering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2956">bringing this to mobile? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2956"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: So I think we talked a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2961">bit about this before, but basically, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2961">know, Chrome is a pretty big set of features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2965">and the Web has a very broad set of features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2965">and so we only just got, you know, Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2971">to &mdash; Chrome to Android a few months ago, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2971">and we only just got Chrome to iOS today, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2977">or yesterday. So we've got a little ways to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2977">go to get to feature parity, and extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2983">is one of those parts that we actually like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2983">to take our time with because it has, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2988">know, deep integration to all of the various </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2988">hooks in the browser. We also think that in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2992">mobile it's quite likely that how you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2992">to extend the browser is going to be different. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3000">Also the performance needs of mobile are different. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3000">So &mdash; so some of the changes we've been making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3005">in the desktop has have been anticipating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3005">our needs in mobile. If you look at the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3010">stuff we've done with event pages in extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3010">where basically there's no longer going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3014">be an always-running persistent background </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3014">page for every single extension, that way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3019">we can be a little more on demand, this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3019">partly to reduce the resource function of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3023">extensions, and we think will make it more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3023">adaptable to mobile down the road. Unfortunately, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3027">you know, I don't have a good timetable to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3027">tell you, but it is something we're interested </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3031">in. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3031"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: All right, switch over to this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3035">side again. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3035"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I'm curious if there's going to be any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3039">advancements in printer support without Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3039">Cloud Print. Right now it seems like you need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3045">a separate machine in order to be able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3045">print. Is there any way that it's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3053">be possible with a Chromebook alone. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3053"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Sounds like you're asking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3058">printing outside of Google cloud but specifically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3058">for Chrome OS. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3062"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3062"><span class="speakerName">Felix Lin</span>: Today people can use any of their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3065">legacy printers by using Cloud Print through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3065">an existing machine on the network. On my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3072">home machine I have windows XP set up, I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3072">got Cloud Print installed and I can get to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3078">any of my legacy printers on the network through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3078">that with pretty much every printer I'm aware </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3085">of on the market today. They're already Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3085">Print enabled, so by simply going any new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3092">printer that you get today pretty much can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3092">just be on the network and accessible to any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3096">Chrome OS or any other device that uses Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3096">Print. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3100"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Oh, okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3100"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: All right. Back to this side. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3106"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I found out I think next year that Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3106">is giving my daughter's school a bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3113">Chrome OS netbooks and we live right next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3113">to Mountain View, so I was just curious like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3120">what's the thinking behind that, and is it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3120">more than just a local thing? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3124">Is it like going to be in other places around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3124">the country? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3127"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: So I know for sure that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3127">had a lot of &mdash; a lot of schools around the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3134">country starting to adopt Chromebooks. Felix </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3134">can probably tell you the exact numbers, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3136">I know that the feedback has been very positive. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3136"><span class="speakerName">Felix Lin</span>: Education is one of the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3142">&mdash; most aggressively verticals adopting Chromebooks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3142">And the beauty of the Web and education is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3150">that, you know, the Web is really a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3150">equalizer, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3153">All the best content, apps, information, accessible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3153">to students, very, very low cost, always up-to-date. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3162">Chromebooks are phenomenal platform for schools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3162">because schools have, you know, shrinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3167">budgets, no IT staff, and being able to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3167">a device that has zero maintenance, zero management, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3173">always up to date, doesn't require a ton of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3173">care and feeding, and gives people access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3178">to all of the tools that they use is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3178">just a great formula for education. We're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3187">&mdash; in addition to, you know, the hundreds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3187">and hundreds of schools I think in 48 states, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3193">there are schools that are deploying Chromebooks, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3193">we're seeing huge initiatives at national </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3200">levels where in many emerging markets countries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3200">are looking to Chromebooks as a way to, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3207">know, transform education and really transform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3207">great economic transformation across the country. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3215">And, you know, it's really all about, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3215">know, the rich content that's available, all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3222">the educational material that is available, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3222">and just the ability to get a situation where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3229">instead of, you know, a 20 students to one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3229">computer type ratio in a school, giving students </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3236">a one to one opportunity where every student </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3236">has a computer that they're using to enhance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3243">their learning, is truly transformational. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3243">And so, you know, from our standpoint, and, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3249">you know, this is the great thing about working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3249">with many of our hardware partners, in education </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3254">we're finding a great willingness on the part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3254">of companies to be able to foster education. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3262">People don't seem to have as large a profit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3262">motive in education as they do in other verticals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3268">where they need to be making, you know, an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3268">enterprise profit, but this is just a huge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3273">opportunity for us and for &mdash; for future students. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3273"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: All right, back to this side. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3281"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. Congratulations, by the way, on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3281">shipping Chrome for iOS. It's a good thing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3287">I was in a session yesterday afternoon, optimizing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3287">your HTML for &mdash; for a mobile device, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3295">the presenter invited us to follow along, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3295">give URL for slides, and said we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3301">to working on this interactively, so I pulled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3301">out my iPad and downloaded Chrome for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3305">iPad, and was following right along, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3305">he said, okay, now we're going to install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3310">the page speed extension, so we can watch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3310">and see what happens, and I said, great, search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3315">for page speed, right here, Chrome Web store, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3315">and it said umm, the Chrome Web store is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3321">supported on your OS. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3321"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: I tried to touch on this earlier, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3327">but extensions are something we definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3327">want to support down the road on mobile and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3331">other platforms. It's just very early days </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3331">and getting into mobile is going to take us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3337">a fair amount of work. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3337"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3340"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Go ahead. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3340"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So another Chrome on iOS question. I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3345">just wondering if it does or is going to support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3345">URL schemes so that iOS developers launch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3351">Chrome if they choose to. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3351"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Do we have anybody from the iOS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3359">team around here that can answer that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3359">Tell you what, why don't you &mdash; if you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3367">we can look that up for you and leave your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3367">e-mail for us. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3369"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: We can put you in touch with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3369">the right people. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3371"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3371"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3373"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Hi. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3373"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I have a question about my Chromebook. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3379">I would like to use it as a Web development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3379">platform with my HTML JavaScript files, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3389">I tried that yesterday and then I ran into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3389">two problems. One is that I don't have a text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3398">editor for my HTML files, and I saw one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3398">the presentations that was using an app, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3405">want to know which app that is. And the second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3405">problem is how to run my HTML files from Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3412">Drive. I only get a preview of the source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3412">code. I don't get a run. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3417"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: So I can talk to that. So that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3417">you're probably talking about our presentation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3423">where we had some text editors running on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3423">Chrome OS, and this is using some of the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3429">apps features that we've been working on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3429">They're pretty early on, so they're right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3434">now available to people developing in Canary, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3434">but we hope to have them more broadly available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3438">later this year. If you're a developer, want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3438">to ride the ragged edge, you know, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3443">come check out &mdash; we've got some sample code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3443">I think that particular little micro editor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3449">is checked into GitHub, and our Google Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3449">repo, but a warning is that it's early, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3457">very simple. It actually isn't as cool as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3457">it looked. We &mdash; we &mdash; we actually hit over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3465">all the rough spots. But there are &mdash; I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3465">tell you that just one of the cool, fun things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3470">about the new apps stuff we've been doing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3470">is just once you add these new capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3474">of seeing what people want to build with them, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3474">and within Chrome team, one of the first things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3479">people wanted to build actually was code editors, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3479">and in fact we have like three of them already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3483">that people are just doing different things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3483">with, and so we actually expect there to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3489">a plethora of code editors. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3489"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: I don't know if you mentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3492">it already or not, there's definitely IDEs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3492">available in the Chrome Web store. A bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3496">of them are pretty highly ranked. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3496"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: The number of cloud ID's emerging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3504">and you can use them, and as the Chrome, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3504">are providing them with the extension APIs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3510">so they could plug into the instrumentation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3510">and get the dev tools integrated into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3516">cloud tools, so you have both complete ID </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3516">with the remote persistence and the debugging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3524">capabilities on the Chrome OS. But it's all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3524">coming. We're working on that. We're working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3529">with base teams on these capabilities. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3529"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: And then how do I run my HTML file? When </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3534">I clicked on the file from Google Drive, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3534">just got a preview. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3540"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: So you have to ask the Drive team, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3540">so unfortunately none of us are from there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3546">so I don't know if they have any plans to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3546">allow direct hosting of HTML straight from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3551">Drive. I assume that's what you mean for public </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3551">consumption, but if you just want to do local </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3557">development, it should be possible to do &mdash; to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3557">read the files locally and render them, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3562">know, in Chrome. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3562">Ian Ellison-Taylor: (inaudible) </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3562"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Yeah, we can check with the drive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3562">team. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3564"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: Yeah, we can check with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3564">Drive team. It looks like we pretty much ran </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3570">out of time. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3570"><span class="speakerName">Ian Ellison-Taylor</span>: Hang on. I forgot one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3573">other Easter Egg, you probably already know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3573">there's another Easter Egg in the video, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3578">History of Chrome, so you might want to study </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3578">that video and &mdash; and there's something pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3584">cool in there so &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3584"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Chang</span>: All right. Perfect timing. Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3588">So thank you for coming.
