<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3">Hey there. I'm Paul Irish. I'm a Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3">Advocate on the Google Chrome team and today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">I'm going to show some advanced uses of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">core Chrome Dev Tools features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="11">First, let's enter into the dev tools. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="11">common to use the app's menu. And you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">also use a keyboard shortcut, like Ctrl-shift-I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">on Windows or Cmd-option-I on Mac. But I prefer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">to open them by right-clicking on an element </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">and choosing Inspect. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="28">Now that we have this open, I can navigate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="28">the DOM by clicking on the arrows, but it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">much quicker to use the keyboard arrow keys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">to traverse up and down the DOM tree. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="36">You’ll notice as I'm selecting these elements, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">I get an onscreen blue highlight, but I also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">get a css selector that represents that element, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">along with its current width and height. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="46">Sometimes, I like to zoom out of the page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">with ctrl - to get the full view while I do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="49">Now, over in the Console tab, I'd like to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">share a few things. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="53">Let's say that you have a big string coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">from your app, and you want to copy it into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">your clipboard. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="59">While you certainly could highlight the entire </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">string with your mouse, it's much more effective </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">to use the console's built in copy method. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="63">I can now paste this wherever I am going. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="76">Sometimes you get too much text in the console. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="76">You can use the clear() function to clear </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">it out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="80">Or, of course, the clear icon below will do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">just the same. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="83">Now sometimes, you have a reference to a DOM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">element, and you want to inspect it. Right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">now, I have a reference to the big headline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">on the page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="90">A simple way to do that is the console's inspect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">function. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="95">Now, let's say you have the reverse: You're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">looking at an element in the Elements tab, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">but you want to access it via scripts. What </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">I used to do is add an ID onto the element </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">and use getElementById. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="112">You’ll notice I brought up the console right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">here. In fact, I can toggle on a console on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">every tab of the dev tools with the escape </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">key. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="119">But instead of setting a temporary ID to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">element, to save time, I can just type $0 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">in the console. This is a shortcut reference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">to whatever element is currently selected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">in this panel. It's just a regular reference, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">so if I'm using jQuery I can toss it into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">it's dollar method easily. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="134">Now over on the Network tab, I'd like to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">a few things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="138">In this waterfall chart, two lines are added. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="143">The blue one points out where the DOMContentLoaded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">event fires, which is basically “document </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">ready” and the red is window's load event, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">which waits for all images and iframes to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">finish. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="151">Now you probably have had to inspect the cookies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">that are associated with your page request </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">before. The Headers tab has that info as one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">of the request headers, but you can now view </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">the current cookies in table format. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="164">You also have the size of each cookie, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="164">you want to keep as small as possible, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">all the cookies are sent in the HTTP header </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">with every request of the page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="172">Now, I'd like to show you a few handy features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">when doing Javascript debugging. I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">to bring up a page with some basic script. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="176">So here, I can filter our results here using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">search or a category filter. Easy enough. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="182">This gallery.js contains most of the functionality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="189">Now I'd like to add some logging to see what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">going on. In Chrome, I can edit the script </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">on the fly inside the UI. This feature is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">unique to Chrome because of how the V8 Javascript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">engine executes your code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="199">I’m going to jump down to the showGallery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">function. I can use cmd-G or ctrl-G to jump </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">to a specific line number. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="209">Now I'd really like to dig into this JSON </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">argument here, so I'm going to console log </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">it out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="214">Now when I filter, I get the object logged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">to the console, where I can poke around with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">it further. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="229">You'll notice I'm also getting an exception </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">thrown on the page. Sometimes it's difficult </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">to figure out where these errors are coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">from. By clicking on this pause button, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">can ask the dev tools to pause execution whenever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">an exception is encountered, effectively giving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">me a breakpoint at that position. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="242">I can now open up the console, again by hitting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">Escape, and figure out what's going on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="247">Whoops! Looks like that element doesn’t </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">exist yet. I guess it’s time to file a bug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">report. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="258">If you'd like to dive into the dev tools, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">I definitely recommend picking up a dev channel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">version of Chrome. It updates weekly and gets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">new features in the dev tools very regularly. </span></p>
