<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="294"><span class="speakerName">Slava Rubin</span>: All right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="295">First, let me just say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">it's a real honor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">to be on this panel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="298">Just several years ago, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">I went to I/O when it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">was at Google campus. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="301">And just to be here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">incredible, and obviously, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">incredible panelists. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="308">Indiegogo was from 2006. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="310">There's two co-founders and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">I, we got together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="313">Eric, Danae, and I were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">overlooking the Golden Gate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">Bridge and we were sharing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">experiences of how frustrated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">we are to try to use the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">internet to raise money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="322">So if you could just go back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">seven years to 2006, you have, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">YouTube is not owned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">by Google yet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="328">Twitter is nascent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="330">You have MySpace is way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">bigger than Facebook. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="334">And Obama is not a word </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">for most people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="338">And it was really difficult to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">raise money using MySpace, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">essentially, and Paypal. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="343">And my dad died of cancer when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">I was 15, and then 10 years </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">later, I decided to do something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">about it for a New </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">Year's resolution, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">I started a charity. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="351">And I wanted to use the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">internet, because I thought I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">was a little tech-savvy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="354">And it was very difficult. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="355">Eric was on the board of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">theater company and he was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">trying to raise money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="359">And Danae was working with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">different filmmakers and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">entrepreneurs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="362">We thought, huh, YouTube is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">doing something interesting in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">the media space, and there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">other companies that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">disrupting other spaces, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">eBay, and Prosper was new. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="371">Why is it that the ultimate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">democratization tool hasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">really created access to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">capital for anyone? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">It is still all a gated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">experience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="380">So we were actually completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">naive, and had not been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">entrepreneurs before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="385">And we launched in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">January 2008. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="389">I would say that there's a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">of myths out there as to how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">you need to become an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">entrepreneur, whether it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">you need to have a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">money to start off with. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="399">Whether it is that you need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">have a perfect marketing plan. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="404">You need to have a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">good business plan. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="406">You need to have done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">a lot of research. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="409">I think the barriers to entry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">are so low that you could so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">quickly be able to identify </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">whether or not you could gain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">traction and move fast in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">whatever direction you can go, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">based on data. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="419">And that is something that 20 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">years ago, you used a business </span><span class="line" data-startTime="423">plan to get that feedback. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="424">Hey, professor, what do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">think of my business plan? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">Then give me feedback. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="428">Now you can actually very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="428">quickly use your business plan </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">online, which is actually just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">right away getting validation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">from the market. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="437">A perfect example of that, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">I'll end here, is we just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">actually had &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">the company that got second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">place at CES for most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">innovative new product was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">founded on Indiegogo, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">Misfit Shine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="448">And they raised nearly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">$1 million and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">this was just an idea. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="451">And it was an idea that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">VCs weren't sure if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">they wanted to fund. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="454">And it's just so interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">now, how it's becoming very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">validated and it's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">out to the market. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="460">And we balanced that with things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">like the first ever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">crowd-funded baby. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="464">Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="465">[LAUGHTER] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="466"><span class="speakerName">Slava Rubin</span>: The couple was not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">able to get insurance as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">needed, and they were able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">get the in vitro fertilization </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">funded through the public. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">Or you have Oscar award-winners </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">from just this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">last February. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">So I think it's a great time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">to really press forward and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">have other thoughts. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="484"><span class="speakerName">Julia Hartz</span>: Wow, I wish I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">have thought about that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">crowdfunded baby. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">Could you do that retroactively, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">or no? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="490"><span class="speakerName">Slava Rubin</span>: What's that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="492"><span class="speakerName">Slava Rubin</span>: You could try. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="494"><span class="speakerName">Julia Hartz</span>: So I'm the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">co-founder and president of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">Eventbrite, and I started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">Eventbrite with my now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">husband, who was my fiance, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">and our third co-founder, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">Renaud Visage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="504">And I wanted to echo some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">sentiments that Slava had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="507">about what you need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="507">to get started. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="511">And I think that what we did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">in the beginning was we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">started with the notion that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">we really did want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">democratize an industry by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">harnessing the power of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="520">And I think that what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">we thought about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">back then, in 2007 &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">which seems like so long ago &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">was that everybody was thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">about the future and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">about the proliferation of our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">online world, and how we'd be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">living in a more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">virtual world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="533">And over the course of a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">years, that our entire world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">would be completely online, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">that we would move farther </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">and farther away from personal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">relationships. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="544">And our thesis was that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">actually, you could use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">technology and the social graph, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">really, to bring people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">together offline easier. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="553">And I think what we've seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">happen is just that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="557">I think that going back to those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">early days, the three of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">us, we bootstrapped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">the company. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="562">We didn't need many resources </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">to test this theory out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="566">We needed a community that liked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">to get together, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">just so happened to be the tech </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">community, of all places. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="571">And we needed to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">a great product. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="574">And so we are very heads-down on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">what mattered to us, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">was truly just the product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">and our customer. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="579">And it was like that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="579">for four years. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="581">And I think that when I look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">back at when we did actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">end up raising money, we knew </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">a lot about ourselves. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="587">And we also knew a lot about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">what was happening in the tech </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">world, what was happening with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">social, what was happening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">with mobile, what was on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">the horizon for data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="595">And that helped us understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">how powerful this product that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="601">we had built could be. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="602">And it helped us, obviously, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">raise money quite quickly at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">that point. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="606">And so from a very small germ </span><span class="line" data-startTime="606">of an idea and, really, no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">money, we are able to set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">our own pace and test </span><span class="line" data-startTime="615">this theory over time. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="617">And I think what comes to mind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="617">today is when you think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">how you spend your time &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">whether it be at a conference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">like Google I/O, or at a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">festival, or running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">an obstacle race &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">those offline experiences are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">incredibly powerful, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">those are indelible memories. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="635">And while we're capturing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">memories on our Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">Glasses, those are the types </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">of things at these offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">experiences that you're never </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">going to quite forget as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">easily as a newsfeed article </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">that you read. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="647">And so I think we're really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">understanding the power of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="650">live experience, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="650">hopefully, you guys are all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">experiencing today. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1651">But see, there's certain types </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1651">of people who say, oh, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1655">didn't get to do that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1655">because there wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">enough this, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1659">I didn't have enough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1659">money, enough time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1662">That person didn't let me. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1663">We couldn't partner </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">with that company. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1665">And there's certain types of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1665">people that say, I got to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">figure it out this way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1669">And the people who don't take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">no for an answer and don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">really care what the obstacle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">is in front of them are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">entrepreneurs. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">That's the spirit of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">entrepreneur, which is, "See </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">wall, run through it."

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1713">Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1714">Now it's become obvious </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1714">that we should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1716">all learn code, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1718">So you have code.org. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1719">You have Chicago starting to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1719">teach code into every high </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1722">school, all this good stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1724">It's just a matter of time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1724">before it becomes obvious that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">teaching, in an experiential </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">way, entrepreneurship should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1730">be part of your curriculum </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1730">from seventh grade, third </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1733">grade, or whatever grade. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1735">And I've written stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1735">about this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1736">Which is kind of sad, in my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">opinion, that when you're a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1739">little kid in kindergarten, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1739">you have those little toys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1741">that you play with, you get to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1741">play with fireman or woman. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1744">You get to play with nurse. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1745">You get to play with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1745">lawyer, doctor. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1747">You don't get to play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">with entrepreneur. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1749">[LAUGHTER] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1750"><span class="speakerName">Slava Rubin</span>: And it might be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1750">because it's really hard to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">say entrepreneur. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">So we could just call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">it Google, whatever. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1754">[LAUGHTER] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1755"><span class="speakerName">Slava Rubin</span>: But really, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">a statement as to how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1758">we grow up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1759">And it's funny, because when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">we graduate high school or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1761">college, we're all told to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1761">innovative and leaders and all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1766">this stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1766">But really, what we're prepared </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1766">to do is to become </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">bankers or developers or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">consultants or whatever you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">want to call it inside somebody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">else's organization, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1777">which is inside of a system that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1777">somebody else created. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1781">Why isn't it that we are being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1781">taught to be able to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1784">risk, be creative, fail &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1786">it's totally good to fail. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1787">We just have to learn that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">Learn from it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1790">So for me, the idea of whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1790">it's equity crowdfunding, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">which is where Indiegogo has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">had a lot of participation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">with the SEC and the White </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">House and all that stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1797">But also in terms of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1797">empowering more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">entrepreneurs &mdash; if you get off </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">on the sixth floor of our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1801">office, which is at 965 Mission, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1801">which is right on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">corner, the first word you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">see is a huge sign of the word </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1807">"Empower." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1808">I mean, that is Indiegogo. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1809">Which is to empower people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">to do what they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1812">didn't think is possible. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1813">See, if you empower an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1813">entrepreneur to do something, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1814">you could change the trajectory </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1814">of the future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1818">There could have an air there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1818">yesterday, and an entrepreneur </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">will create reality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1822">So it's just fascinating. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1823">So I think more of you should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">have raised your hands. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2079">I think you have to do what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2079">Slava said, which is, be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">willing to run through as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">many walls as possible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2085">I, too, agree with him, in terms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2085">of that's what makes an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">entrepreneur an entrepreneur, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">just that eternal optimism. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2093">But I think that having that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">idea and having that moment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2098">that Stewart had, when he woke </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2098">up in the middle the night, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2100">exactly what goes into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2100">this mixture. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2103">And then vision is something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2103">that really matters when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">you're trying to get people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">to sign on to your idea. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2109"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Yeah, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2109">nowadays, also, we just feel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">like ideas, we have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">lot of same ideas. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">But no one just go ahead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">and execute them. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">So probably execution is one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">the most important when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2122">have the idea. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2124"><span class="speakerName">Julia Hartz</span>: Well, I mean, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">that's how you make the idea </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2125">into a reality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2126">You have to execute. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2127">And honestly, like day to day, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2127">we're put to the task of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">executing, even seven years </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">into our vision, I guess. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2138">If you're not executing, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2138">you really aren't able to grow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2142">a viable idea into a company and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2142">get people to support you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2147">So yeah, I think they're all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">incredibly important. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2150"><span class="speakerName">Slava Rubin</span>: I would say that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2150">"idea is super important" is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2154">one of the ten myths of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2154">entrepreneurship. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2157">Meaning, it's not. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">If it was so big of an idea, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">it mattered so much, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2162">the idea of a coffee shop would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2162">not become Starbucks. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2166">Obviously, other people know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2166">that idea as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2168">So it's really about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2168">execution. </span></p>
