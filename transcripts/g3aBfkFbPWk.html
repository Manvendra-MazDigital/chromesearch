<p><span class="line" data-startTime="34">And so two, three years ago, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">someone posed the question of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">what would it be like if we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">could run native code inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">the browser? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">And that seemed like a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">interesting question, and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">sort of broke down into two main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">goals for that, that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">started really investing in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="54">The first, of course, was how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">to bring native applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">to the web in terms of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">performance and the power. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="62">But also maintaining what's good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">about the web in terms of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">security and portability, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">that was goal number one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="69">Goal number two was really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">about enriching the web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">ecosystem by bringing a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">of other programming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">languages to the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="78">Particularly programming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">languages that had been around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">and were in popular use, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">and had been in popular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">use for a long time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="85">So that started a long road, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">and I think it was pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">entertaining, and we've come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">a long way I think in those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">three years. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="92">So to talk a little bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">about the technology and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">goals, I'm going to start with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">the technical lead for Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">Client, Brad Chen, come on up. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="144">We needed to make a system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">that was powerful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="147">We needed to make a system that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">would enable developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">to deliver applications that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">were new and exciting, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">that weren't already happening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">on the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="157">Now, in the three or so years </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">that have transpired since we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">first started the research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">project, we've made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">significant progress towards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">solving these problems. With </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">our Chrome 14 release, we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">shipped a browser that allows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">application developers to ship </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">real applications using the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">Native Client sandbox. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="179">Together with a core set of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">Pepper interfaces that support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">facilities such as 2D graphics, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">real-time audio </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">playback, URL loading, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">asynchronous messaging with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="193">And we've really enjoyed seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">our early adopter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">developers deliver vintage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">arcade games to Native Client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">on the web, by porting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">emulators </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">like MAME and DOSBox. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="207">In our more recent release, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">we've actually added some more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">ambitious and yet very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">important features. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="216">One really key feature is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="221">This enables developers to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">do real-time rendering of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">detailed scenes, providing the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">kinds of rich interactive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">experience that we're all trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">to deliver these days. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="233">We also provide sandbox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">local file storage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="238">This is a critical feature for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">developers who want to provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">a really great user experience, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">both online and offline. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="245">It enables application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">developers to provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">applications that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">start quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="251">Because graphics, audio, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">other kinds of application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">data are stored once on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">local disk, and so they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">already available the next time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">the application starts. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="263">We also provide, in our most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">recent releases, dynamic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">loading and the popular GNU libc </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">implementation, making it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">that much easier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">to port complex </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">applications to Native Client. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="279">I'd also like to mention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">full-screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">mode and mouse capture. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="283">These are critical features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">for application developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">that are trying to provide a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">truly immersive experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="292">The result of all of this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">that today, through Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">Client, application developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">can use native code safely in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">Chrome across all popular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">desktop operating systems.

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="329"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Thanks, Brad, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">and hi everyone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="332">So you've heard that developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">are now going to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">able to bring their native code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">to the web, but what does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">that really mean for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">the web at large? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">Well the first thing is, is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">it means that decades of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">native code that's been built, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">and the expertise that comes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">with it, and those millions of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">developers who are experienced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">in developing native code, can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">now bring that to the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="352">It'll now be an easy decision </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">for them to decide to port </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">their applications to the web, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">because they no longer have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">rewrite them from scratch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">in HTML and JavaScript. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="363">There's now no reason why </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">many desktop and mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">applications can't also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">run on your browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="370">We're also going to enable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">higher performance computing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">on the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="374">Now, native code, running in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">NaCl will often run multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">times faster than JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">today, and that's in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">single-threaded mode. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="383">But Native Client also has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">access to efficient </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">multi-threading, which means it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">can take full advantage of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">your multi-core CPUs. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="392">This is going to enable a wide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">variety of applications that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">weren't possible on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">the web before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="398">Now, it's going to do this while </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">maintaining the security </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">model of the web today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="404">Now the main reason for this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">is the sandbox that Brad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">mentioned earlier. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="408">But it's also because of our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">philosophy and what kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">APIs that we've brought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">to Native Client. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="414">Unlike previous technologies, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">like NPAPI and ActiveX, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">not bringing new capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">to the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="421">Instead, what we're bringing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">is the web capabilities to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">Native Code. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="426">Now this means that Native Code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">will run with the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">security level as JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="432">Now we believe the applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">you're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">see tonight are going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">demonstrate the real need for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">this technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="439">It's bringing applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">that were never before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">possible on the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="443">And as such, we think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">important for this technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">to not be limited to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">a single browser. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="450">We've developed Native Client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">from the beginning in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">public as an open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">project, and are committed to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">working with other browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">vendors to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">bring it to all users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="459">We work closely with the open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">source community, accepting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">external contributions, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">we're looking forward to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">continuing that close </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">relationship. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="468">Now that's what it means for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">the web, but what about for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">developers? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">Well, one of the big problems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">developers have today is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">there are so many platforms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="480">You're having to develop for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">Windows, for Mac, maybe iOS, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">and Android, maybe a game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">console, then there's the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="489">This often involves you having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">to maintain multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">development teams, multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">code bases &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">trying to keep them all in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">sync is a very expensive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">proposition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="498">With Native Client, you're now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="498">going to be able to leverage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">your existing code base, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">and quickly and easily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">bring it to the web. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="505">We've seen already developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="505">bring million line code bases </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">to Native Client, in just a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">couple of weeks and a handful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">of developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="513">And that's including the time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">necessary to just learn the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">technology to begin with. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="518">Now, for many developers, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">best part is going to be the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">fact that now on the web you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">going to be able to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">your favorite programming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">language. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="526">You don't need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">learn new stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="528">You can leverage your existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">knowledge, your existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">tools, your existing technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">that you've spent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">so much time and effort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">investing in. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">So this is really where kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">a partnership with Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1560">around Native Client made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1560">a lot of sense. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1563">And we actually think this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1563">going to benefit developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1567">and consumers alike. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1569">If we can roll the first video, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">that would be great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1572">So this is actually the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1572">Unity tool chain. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1574">So this is what it actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">looks like when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1575">you're making a game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1577">And as you can see, there is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">little check box that says </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">enable Native Client, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">then you push Go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1584">So our goal in working with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1584">Google, and our goal to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1588">our lives easier for developers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1588">is really kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1591">that simple. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1592">Let's make it that easy. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">The other way we think it'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">benefit developers is through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">distribution and monetization. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1602">And we're always looking for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1602">ways to help our developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">reach new audiences and monetize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">their games better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1608">Because after all, everybody's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1608">got to make a living, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">So our web plug-in has an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">installed base of about 90 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1615">million, but we're really happy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1615">to be able to add the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1618">200 million and growing Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1618">users worldwide to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1625">distribution channel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1626">And we also think having a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1626">monetization channel through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1629">the Chrome web store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1629">will help our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">developers earn a nice living. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1636">But we think the benefits will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1636">also extend to consumers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1639">We think that having that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1639">frictionless gaming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">experience &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">and if you can roll video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">number two, please. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">So this is a game by a company </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">called SilverTree Media based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">in Palo Alto, and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">game is called Cordy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1653">And you can see how easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">it is to launch. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1655">No plug-in, no dialogues, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1655">frictionless. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1658">We think this will make the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">consumers much more likely to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1661">play games and to spend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1661">money in games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1664">The other way we think the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">consumers will benefit is from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">the native level performance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1669">And this is where we've done a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">lot of work with Google to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">make sure that we hit native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">quality performance, so you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1677">can really have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1677">beautiful gaming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">experience out of the box. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1682">And finally, we think consumers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1682">will benefit because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">there's just going to be a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">of great games out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1687">So we've got over 2,000 games </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">on mobile, we'd love to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1691">them all come to Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1691">Client, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1693">we think they will. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1695">So why are we &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1697">you can finish the video &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1699">why are we here today? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1701">Today we're announcing the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1701">deployment of five Unity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">Native Client games to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">the Chrome web store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1708">And they are two by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">SilverTree Media &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">Cordy, which we showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">you, and Sleepy Jack. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1713">Two by Exit Strategy, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1713">Pirates of New </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1716">Horizons and Planet Buster. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1718">And finally, one by a company </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1718">called Dedalord. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1748"><span class="speakerName">Christian Stefansen</span>: Right, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1748">these examples really show how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">Native Client can push the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">boundaries of what's possible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1754">on the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1756">And on that note, we're really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">excited to see several other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">middleware being ported </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">to Native Client. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1763">These include Unity, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">as you've just heard. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1765">It includes Bullet, the physics </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1765">engine; Moai, another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">game engine; FMOD and Wwise, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">audio engines; and Mono which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">enables you to write your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">in the entire dot net family </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">of languages. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1780">And this is really exciting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">because it means the Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1783">Client platform is much more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1783">accessible to the hundreds of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">thousands of developers who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">are already using these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">middleware products. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">So then the question is, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">what's next for Native Client? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1796">And I've got it right here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1798">We are adding features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1800">We'll be adding more APIs for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">networking, in particular for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1803">web sockets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1804">We're scoping out APIs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">for game pads. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1806">I'm sure a lot of people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1806">in the audience will be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">interested in that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1811">And we're adding more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1811">features, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1813">memory mapped files. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1815">This means that when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">reading or writing large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1818">files, you can get a performance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1818">increase of orders </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">of magnitude, really. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">What's more important is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">notice that these interfaces, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">the Pepper APIs, are going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">continue to evolve in tandem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1829">with the web platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1831">And what that means is whenever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">a new capability is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1834">added to the browser, you would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1834">expect to see JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">APIs for that capability, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">Pepper APIs for the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1841">capability being added at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1841">roughly the same time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1845">And whenever that does happen, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">we're going to make sure to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1848">have an SDK ready with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1848">header files, and all you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">need, in the hands of developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">at the time where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1853">that version of Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1853">is in beta channel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1856">So you'll have time to develop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1856">apps that take advantage of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1859">these features before it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1859">shipped into stable channel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1865">Another key thing for Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1865">Client has always been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1868">portability. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1868">And the portability benefits </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1868">of the system today are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">already pretty compelling, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">but there's more work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1875">In order really to be as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1875">portable as JavaScript, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">need to eliminate any barriers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">to the introduction of new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1882">instruction sets or new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1882">operating systems. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">And to that end, David </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">Sehr who's in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1889">audience here today &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1891">David, do you want to &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1893">David Sehr is leading </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1893">an effort called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">Portable Native Client. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1896">And Portable Native Client will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1896">introduce an instruction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">set mutual wire format to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">Native Client, while </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1902">maintaining the performance and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1902">the security benefits that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1906">we've already established </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1906">for the system. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1909">And this is really important, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">because this means that Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1911">Client is going to run, not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1911">just on today's operating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">systems, and today's instruction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">set architectures, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1917">but on the future operating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1917">systems, and future </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1920">instruction set architectures. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">So with that, I'd like to invite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">Ian back on stage for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1927">couple of closing remarks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1928">Ian. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1931">IAN ELLISON TAYLOR: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1931">So hopefully &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1934">there's obviously a lot we could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1934">cover, and in the time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1937">available we can only give you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1937">a brief taste of what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1942">possible in Native Client. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1943">But hopefully we've given you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1943">at least a good sense of how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1948">we've achieved on some of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1948">original points that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1950">mentioned way back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1950">in the beginning. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1952">How we can really push the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">boundary in terms of the kinds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">of applications that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">run on the web by bringing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1959">native-like performance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1961">But also maintaining the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">portability and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">scalability, and the reach, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">and the deployment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1967">benefits of the web. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">So taking those things together, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">and these amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1971">demos, and many others that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1971">couldn't show, hopefully that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1974">all comes together into a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1974">pretty compelling story. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1977">So we at Google, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">are very excited about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">possibilities and what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">we've seen so far. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1983">More to the point, hopefully you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1983">are getting excited about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">what you could maybe come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">up with that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1989">haven't seen today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1991">So I very much look forward to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1991">seeing what kinds of amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1995">experiences you come up with in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1995">the weeks and months ahead, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">as we continue to drive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">the platform forward. </span></p>
