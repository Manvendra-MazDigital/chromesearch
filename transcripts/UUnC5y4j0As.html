<h1>Native Client: When to use the technology</h1>

<h2></h2>

<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/UUnC5y4j0As">youtu.be/UUnC5y4j0As</a><div id="transcript"><p><span class="line" data-startTime="2">Hi! My name is Christian and I am the Product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">Manager for Native Client, a technology that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">allows you to run native code in the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">in a safe way. In developer events, I am often </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">asked in what ways Native Client can help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">developers. In this video, I am going to present </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">the most common use cases where our team thinks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">Native Client can make a huge difference. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="21">Many developers have large code bases written </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">in C or C++ and want to use this code to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">web applications. So, rewriting everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">in JavaScript would take a long time. With </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">Native Client it is fairly easy to port your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">existing code to the web platform. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="35">For example one engineer working at Spacetime </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">Studios ported Star Legends - an MMO with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">half a million lines of code in just 2 weeks! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">There are also many cases where an application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">has significant performance requirements. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="46">While we’ve seen amazing improvements in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">JavaScript performance the last couple of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">years, some applications need all the performance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">they can get. Native Client runs native code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">so you can create these performance intensive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">applications for the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="60">If you’ve developed a desktop app that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">want to make portable across operating systems, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">we believe Native Client can help you out, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">especially if your app performs heavy computation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">like many games, photo editing and video editing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">apps. With Native Client you only have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">maintain one code base but your app can run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="79">Finally, we understand that for some web apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">you may prefer to write parts of them in languages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">other than JavaScript. Native Client currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">has the tools that allow you to write web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">applications that run C and C++ code in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">browser. Mono also works on Native Client, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">so you can run the .NET family of languages, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">such as C#. And in the future we’ll work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">to support even more languages. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="105">These are the most common use cases where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">we believe Native Client can be helpful for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">developers.
