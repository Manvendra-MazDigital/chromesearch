<p><span class="line" data-startTime="35">And it was really funny because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">the hardest thing for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">me to find was dedicated game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">servers to run my game engine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">and test with players. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="42">I would be trolling IRC at late </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">hours of the night, just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">trying to find somebody willing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">to host my game and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">get 32 friends on it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">really stress test it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="50">It was extremely hard to find. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="52">And it's interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">today that that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">is no longer a problem. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="55">You have a vast amount of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">computing resources available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">for building out amazing games, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">and now the challenge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">is really, how do you create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">those games and create them in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">a way that's really going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">scale as the number of users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">playing your game scales? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">And at the end of the day, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">really comes down to building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">in a way that when your game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">becomes an unexpected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">success &mdash; there's just massive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">growth, 20 fold </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">over what you expected &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">that you can survive that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">onslaught scale and make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">everyone can get in and have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">really great experience on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">your platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="81">And that's really what we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">talking about with this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">session is how to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">that possible on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">Google Cloud Platform. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="87">So the game plan starts off with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">a very high level Compute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">Engine and App Engine and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">Google Cloud Platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">overview, just highlighting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">the fundamental building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">blocks that we'll be working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">with throughout the session. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="97">Up next is looking at mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">gaming architecture that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">really shows you how all these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">pieces fit together to solve a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">lot of common problems mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">developers face when they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">building out games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="106">And then up next, what better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">than to hear it from people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">who have done this themselves </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">and scaled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">to a huge user base? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">And so some great guys from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">FreshPlanet are going to come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">up and talk about how they used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">this platform to power </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">their game "SongPop." And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">finally, wrapping it up with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">dedicated game server that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">really targets the real time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">gaming where you need tens of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">thousands of virtual machines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">running all of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">game servers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="126">So that's really what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">we have in store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">over the next 45 minutes. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="130">So many of you have probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">seen this slide if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">attended the Cloud Platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">keynote, and it really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">highlights all of the amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">technology we've exposed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="138">And really, it's amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">how you connect it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="141">But as a developer, the biggest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">challenge is, what do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">I need to know here? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">What is relevant? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">How do all the pieces </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">connect together? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">And furthermore, how do I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">augment all these other Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">services, such as the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">Play Games that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">was announced yesterday? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">What value can that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">bring to my app? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">So what's really interesting and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">what continues to blow me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">away is just the scale of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">Google Cloud Platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="159">We announced that we have over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">three million active </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">applications yesterday </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">and over 300,000 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">developers every month. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="165">And just every day, we seem to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">run into really amazing game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">studios pushing the limits of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">the technology in creating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">these next generation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">gaming experiences. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="174">So this is just a sample of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">the game studios that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">building on the platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="178">And what's really interesting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">it's a huge spectrum. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="180">You're looking at AAA Studios </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">all the way down to small </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">indie studios, and they're all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">leveraging the platform to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">deliver these next generation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">experiences. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="187">And what's even cooler is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">it's not just one game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="190">They really get hooked on App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">Engine, and it becomes a way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">of building out their games. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="194">They understand the platform, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">they know how to scale on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">Google, and they trust Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">to scale based on past </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">experiences they've had. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="199">For example, EA Games has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">launched over five games on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">the platform from "Tetris" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">to "The Simpsons Game" to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">"Yahtzee." You don't even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">realize what's powering these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">games because it just scales </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">seamlessly as these games take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">off and you see all of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">friends playing them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="213">And another one that really blew </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">me away was Epic Games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="217">I had no idea "Infinity Blade </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">2," the compelling social </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">features were all powered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">by App Engine &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">no idea until I was talking to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">them at GDC and they mentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">this, and it's just absolutely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">amazing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="226">And what blew away the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">about this example was the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">fact that it was done by mostly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">one guy in six weeks. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="232">Could you imagine having to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">build out the back end for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">"Infinity Blade 2"? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">You have six weeks, you're one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">guy, and you know that tens of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">millions of people are going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">to download this game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="239">That's pressure, and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">really when they turned to App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">Engine because they know and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">trust it to scale and deliver </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">and allow them to really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">launch and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">have a great success. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="248">They also used it for "Vote!! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">The Game" as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="250">That was a very timely piece, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">but it was also pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="253">Check it out as well for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">"Infinity Blade" meets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">election politics. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="258">And looking at the core </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">fundamental aspects of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">building on the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">Cloud Platform, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">first one is App Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="264">Most people know what this is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="266">It's been around for five or six </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">years, and really that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">the Platform as a Service that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">easy to build, easy to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">deliver, easy to deploy, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">easy to maintain your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="273">You write it in a language of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">your choice that's provided, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">and then you can use this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">platform to really scale up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">with respect to your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">user base. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="281">Another real, foundation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">building block of gaming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">solutions is Compute Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="285">It's looking at that scenario </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">where you need your own open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">and flexible platform to run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">any code, any packages, any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">software, to run your custom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">game engine, to run some large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">game engines. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="296">If you want to run NoJS, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">provides that flexibility. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="298">And I'm going to touch a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">bit on really what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">we've seen Compute Engine being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">great for for developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">and what kind of experiences </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">they've been having on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">platform with Compute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">Engine specifically. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="308">And time and time again, it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">the consistent performance and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">the amazing network that has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">blown developers away and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">pushed their imagination of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">what's actually possible on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">Cloud Platforms. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="318">Here's just one of them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="319">Actually, Ed's in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">audience right now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="320">You can talk to him more about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">this, that I didn't just make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">this quote up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="323">So Chrome JAM, you may have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">heard about this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="325">It was a project that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">basically you log in, jam out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">with four friends, real time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">audio streaming, and it had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">extremely tight latency </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">requirements. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="333">And it wasn't even possible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">on some of the other cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">platforms, but it was possible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">on Compute Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="338">So when I got this quote that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">your latency's crazy low, pat </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">the team on the back, definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">fired it off to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">networking team. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="343">And they love seeing feedback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">like this because it really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">justifies all the hard work we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">put into the technology over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">the many, many years. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="350">Also, you may have seen this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">MapR Terasort World Record. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="354">The MapR broke the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">Terasort World </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">Record on Compute Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="357">Amazing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="358">What's really cool about this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">for game developers is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">fact that they broke it in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">cloud-based environment, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">the past record was held by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">dedicated hardware in their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">own data center. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="366">So this really challenges the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">expectations as a developer if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">you're building out a game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="370">OK, I need 1,000 servers in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">East Coast to support my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">traffic there, 1,000 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">in Europe. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="375">You can really now leverage the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">Cloud Platform and start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">to scale up where your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">user base is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="379">And the key message here is if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">you tried cloud platforms in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">the past for running these game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">engines, and they just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">haven't been able to scale </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">or have the latency or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">performance you expect, check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">our Compute Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="387">You'll be happily surprised. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="388">And this is just one of the many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">examples that show how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">that performance is delivering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">real results. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="393">And finally, it really can be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">summed up in a nice, neat </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">little package with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">a little bow. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="398">Kunal from Wizard Ops, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">moved their application over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">to Compute Engine and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">immediately, they went, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">"Everything is just noticeably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">faster in the application." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">And we're not talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">going in the logs and seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">10 milliseconds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="409">It's actually in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">application, playing the game, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">firing off requests, doing all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">the actions, everything just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">responded quicker, and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">performance blew them away </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">from what they were expecting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">based on past experiences. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="420">So that is Cloud Platform in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">nutshell, and now we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">to jump into an architecture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">that highlights how to piece </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">together all of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">components. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="430">And with that, we always try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">to highlight the key design </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">requirements a lot of developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">face when building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">out these applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="439">Firstly, iOS, Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">devices &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">and if you're building a game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">now, quite often you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">looking at multi-platform. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="445">And the other really big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">important thing is being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">scalable to millions of users, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">but not just being able to hit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">a million users, ten million, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">100 million users, but scaling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">in a way that makes sense so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">you're not over and under </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">provisioned, and you're not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">spending a huge amount on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">servers when you only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">have five players. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="458">And at the end of the day, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">really about creating an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">engaging social game that just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">grows virally and gives you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">some really great growth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="463">And actually, FreshPlanet will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">talk a bit more about things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">they did with that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="467">And whenever we do one of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">reference architectures, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">we love to show an application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">that highlights it is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">straightforward to get up to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">speed and start running and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">piecing together all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">these components. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="477">And so with that, we created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">a sample application called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">Griddler which we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">open source very soon, and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">just highlights how you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">build a mobile game very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">quickly on the platform. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="486">And so if I switch over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">to the overhead. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="490">It works. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="490">So essentially, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">join in this game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="492">It's an asynchronous-based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">mobile real game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="494">And so you can go there, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">can challenge your friends, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">you can play by yourself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="497">And so if I jump in and I go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">to Challenge An Opponent, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">you'll see that I only have one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">friend, but Greg, he's my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">best friend. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="504">We play this game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">all of the time. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="506">And so you go in here, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">challenge him to a game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="509">So this will basically then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">hit App Engine, send off a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">push notification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">to his device. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="513">And then once he accepts that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">device, it'll start a count </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">down, and we'll be competing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">in real time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">against this game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="519">It's kind of unfair because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">Greg worked very closely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">developing the game and knows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">all of the answers to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">riddle, where I've only made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">it through the first three. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="526">And so once he accepts the push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">notification that makes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">it to his device, that should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">start, assuming we don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">any unexpected Wi-Fi challenges </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">and so forth. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="535">Anything on your device yet? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">Well, what you will see &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">we'll try one more time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="542">I don't want to have one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">these mobile demos that goes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">down in flames. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="545">We seem to have really bad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">experience with doing mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">demos in Cloud Platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="548">Always, the unexpected stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">happens regardless of how much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">you'll test. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="551">But you'll notice that I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">actually plugged into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">power on the phone, so we learn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">from our mistakes very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="556">quickly at Google for anybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="556">who was at the keynote. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="559">So it looks like the phones in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">this room and the wireless </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">isn't quite working right, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">let's jump into Single Player. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="564">And so this is exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="564">what you see. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="565">So you're hitting App Engine, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">you're getting requests for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">all of the game boards, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">and you jump in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="569">And so you get something like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">what has to be broken before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">it can be used? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">I know the answer because I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">done this one a few times. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="574">Egg. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="576">Feed me and I live, yet give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">me a drink and I die. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="579">Fire. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="580">Let's see. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="581">Where's fire? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">Right here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="583">And so you go through, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">you're competing against your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">friend to get the quickest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">time, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="586">highest score, et cetera. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="678">And really where the magic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">begins is when you connect it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">to App Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="681">Cloud Endpoint is an amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">piece of technology for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">creating a RESTful API and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">seamlessly connecting your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">mobile applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">to your front ends </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">running on App Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="690">It provides RESTful APIs and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">strongly typed libraries for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">your devices that make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">very simple to call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">that from code natively. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="697">I had the misfortune of having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="697">to do this before Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">Endpoints existed, creating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">a RESTful API with full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">authentication, and it is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">easy to do that, and Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">Endpoints makes everyone's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">lives a lot easier now. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="709">And so what does that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">actually look like? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">It really is dead simple to put </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">together an application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">that calls Cloud Endpoints. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="716">You add this annotation to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="716">declare the path you would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="718">like and the variables, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="718">you'll see essentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">within App Engine in Java, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">define the function, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">define the variables you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">looking at, and then what will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">be generated is this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">client library &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="727">for example, shown here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="727">for Android &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">that just makes it very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">simple to call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">gameBackend.sendInvitation, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">and that's it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="733">One of the really cool things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">here you may not have noticed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">is the fact that we have a user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">parameter in App Engine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">to use, but there's nothing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">we're sending actually from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="740">the client application. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="741">And that's populated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">automatically if you need that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">for application and making sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">the user is who they say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">they are, and you have the full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">authentication baked in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="747">Really, really cool stuff, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">that all uses Google's API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="752">The other aspect is looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">pushing notifications out to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">the device, such as this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">push notification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="758">that I sent to Greg. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="760">And this is really where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">Google Cloud Messaging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">provides all that functionality, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">and you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">even leverage some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">of the stuff that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">was announced yesterday. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="767">But another thing that's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">cool here is Apple Push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">Notification works </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">from App Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="771">So some people in the room might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">have tried this a year </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">ago and realized it wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">possible very quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="776">But now, it is possible because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">the socket's API makes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="779">it seamless to integrate Apple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="779">Push Notification Service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">directly with App Engine and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">call that without much effort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">on your end. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="785">And so it really is seamless. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="786">I mean, within App Engine, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">import the required libraries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">and so forth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="791">And then from there, it's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">standard exactly what you'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">expect, the push.Alert, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">send the device IDs, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">messages, et cetera. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="797">So we actually are going to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">a paper published very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">soon to show you how to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">that out on App Engine, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="802">also a sample application to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="802">give you something to get up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">to speed very quickly. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="806">So the only nuances that come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">into play here are just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">working with Apple Push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">Notification Service. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="810">For example, they don't like you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">opening many, many socket </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">connections, so you'd be looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">at using something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="814">like maintaining a socket </span><span class="line" data-startTime="814">connection in the back end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">that lives around forever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">and doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="818">terminate after every request. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="819">And then you can use mechanisms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="819">like the task </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">queues to really batch those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">up and send them through. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="823">So all the components of App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">Engine really provide the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">scalable framework to allow you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">to scale up to sending out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="827">tens of millions of push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="827">notifications. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="831">And so one of the secret </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">sauces of App Engine &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">one of the many, many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">secret sauces. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="837">I mean, it's a delicious thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="837">full of crazy secret sauces, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">but the Datastore, in my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">opinion, is one of the biggest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">things that really gives App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">Engine, makes it a great place </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">for developers to work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="846">It's a NoSQL database </span><span class="line" data-startTime="846">that just scales </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">to ridiculous size. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="850">And when you combine that with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="850">Memcache, you can really scale </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">up to 80 million users without </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">having any hiccups at all in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="855">your database layer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="856">And so with that, for Griddles </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">for example, all of those game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="859">boards are frequently accessed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="859">and requested, it makes sense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">to cache those in Memcache. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="864">I mean, Memcache isn't an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">infinite service, and you need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">to use it wisely. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="866">But those are being requested </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">for every single player, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">it's a perfect use case. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="870">However, the Datastore is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">great place to store all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="873">those user scores, profiles, et </span><span class="line" data-startTime="873">cetera, all of the games, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">all of the challenges. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="878">And of course, you'll keep all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="878">of the boards in there long </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">term and just refresh </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">them in case the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="881">Memcache gets evicted. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="883">So that's one example of how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="883">you can think about using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">Datastore and Memcache when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">you're building out these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">mobile applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="888">And then the other aspect really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">is the Tasks Queued, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="890">Schedule Tasks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="891">These we kind of highlighted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">when talking about Apple Push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">Notification Service. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="894">And Schedule Task, for example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">would be great if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="896">want to go through daily and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="896">send out a notification to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">anybody who hasn't played the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">game in a week just saying, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">hey, we have new content. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="903">Would you like to try, or a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">of these things you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">mobile applications doing. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="908">And up next, a lot of times, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="908">you need to have an online </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">object store to store video or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">pictures or a lot of this rich </span><span class="line" data-startTime="914">content that users expect. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="916">You may have seen this in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">Cloud Platform Overview where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="918">we're storing video on Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="918">Storage, and this is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="920">straightforward to connect to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="920">App Engine, connect to your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="922">mobile devices, and start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="922">storing all that content here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="924">And if you're looking at things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">like using images, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">Image service is a great way of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">rescaling any images a user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="929">uploads so it matches whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="929">UI you have set up with your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">mobile application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="935">And finally, Compute Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="937">I mean, it's amazing to be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">to fork out to Compute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">Engine any of these batch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">processing workloads or any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="941">time you want to run any code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="941">at all that doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">necessarily work within App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">Engine, and that is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">where Compute Engine is a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">use case in this example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">for mobile applications. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="950">Although you want to leverage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="950">App Engine for a lot of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="951">scalability aspects &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="951">that'll get you up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">to speed the quickest &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">Compute Engine is there to back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">you up when you need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">run your own Linux virtual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">machines and custom software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="958">packages and so forth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="960">The example we really like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">to talk about is video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">transcoding, for example. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="963">You have videos in the Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="963">Storage, pulling them out, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="966">doing the transcoding, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="966">and putting them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="967">back in Cloud Storage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="968">And then the Task Queue is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="968">really the key mechanism to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="971">orchestrate that communication </span><span class="line" data-startTime="971">between Compute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="973">Engine and App Engine. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="975">And that is also very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="975">seamless to set up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="977">I realized during this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="977">presentation, I say "seamless" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="980">many, many times, but it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="980">really is seamless. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="982">Talk to anybody who has built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">on the platform and created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="984">these massive games, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="984">will echo the exact same sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">of sentiments. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="988">So when you create the instance, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">all you have to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="990">to set up Task Queue is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="990">straightforward. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="992">You just specify the service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="992">scope to give access to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="995">Task Queue within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="995">that project. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="997">From there, if you were in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="997">instance on Compute Engine, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1000">you'll have access to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1000">metadata with the access token </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1002">or to call out like that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1003">Otherwise, if you're using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">things like the Client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1005">Library, it's very seamless to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1005">go in and just one line of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">code, to configure that, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">then from there, you can start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">calling Task Queue and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">can perform a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1012">of operations there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1015">And those operations are similar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">to what you'd expect. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1017">I mean, you can pull a lease </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">down on a task, do a bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1019">processing work, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1019">delete that task once </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1022">everything's completed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1024">And one of those completion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">steps might include putting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">another task back on the queue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">where App Engine can be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">pulling that information back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">down and doing some more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1030">processing, notifying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1030">the user, et cetera. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">And finally, if you're looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">at things like autoscaling, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1035">the Task Queue Stats </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1035">is a great place </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1036">to go there as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1037">So if you see you have 1,000 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">videos waiting to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">transcoded, increase the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">number of instances. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1041">That's just one of the many ways </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1041">you can scale on Compute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">Engine, and you can really have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">the flexibility to tweak </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1045">that to whatever kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1045">techniques you're familiar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">with using. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1051">So the last aspect of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1051">solution is BigQuery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1054">BigQuery is absolutely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1054">amazing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1056">I was talking to a customer a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1056">couple days ago, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1058">thought it was voodoo magic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1058">because it's real time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">analytics for massive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">data sets. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">And so they ran a query over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">five billion rows, and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1065">returned in three seconds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1066">That didn't make any sense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">to them at all. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1068">This is impossible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1069">Something must be wrong. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1069">But actually, it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">working correctly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1072">It's based on proven, bullet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1072">tested Google technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1075">And it's really great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1075">for mobile games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1077">Almost every studio we talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">to that is building on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1079">platform and has scaled up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1079">to millions of users uses </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1081">BigQuery for getting a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1081">really great insight into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">their application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1085">A great example of how you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">use it is you have every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1089">single action per </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1089">user per day. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">It's a great opportunity to run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">a MapReduce over that job </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1093">and aggregate it down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1093">to a level that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">you really care about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1097">For example, total actions per </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1097">user per day instead of every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1100">single action. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1101">At that point, you can put it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">into BigQuery and start asking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1104">really insightful things, such </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1104">as, what happens to users who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1109">stop playing for a week, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1109">we send them a promotion? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">Do they come back? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">Or if I have a double experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">weekend, do people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">spend more? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">Do people play longer? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">It's a really powerful component </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">for getting a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">this insight that is key to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">building a mobile application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1122">And finally, you've actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">come to the best Glass session </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">in my opinion, although I might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">be a little bit biased. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">When looking at building out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">apps on Glass, I mean, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">have the Mirror API, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">can do native Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1132">But really, it's the back end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">where the magic happens. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1135">When you're creating the next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">generation of applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">powered by Glass, Google Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">Platform is the best place to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">go and build those applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">out because you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1143">can leverage all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1143">this technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1145">And when you only have a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1145">of developers with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">devices, there's not going to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">a lot of cost, but once it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">takes off, you'll be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">to scale up massively. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1151">And so really, you can use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1151">things like Cloud Endpoints, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">you can connect it through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">Mirror API. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1243">About one year ago, we released </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1243">"SongPop."

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1327">In terms of scale, what it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1327">represents when you're at this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1329">point, it's 300 million </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1329">requests a day on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">infrastructure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1333">It's three billion Datastore </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1333">operations per day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1338">We were streaming around 20 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1338">terabytes a day of songs and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1342">album covers for the music. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1344">So let's dig a bit and see how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">we structure that and which of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">the Google Cloud products we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">used to reach this scale. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1352">On the left, you can see that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1352">have those three different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1354">clients that we support, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1354">iOS, Android, the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1358">They're all talking to our App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1358">Engine back end written in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1361">Python with the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1361">simple JSON API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1365">Then they fetch all the media </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1365">contents, so the song samples </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">and the album cover on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">Google Cloud Storage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1373">And we have to push data back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">to our users when we release </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">new playlists, when we think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">they might be interested, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1379">they have a new challenge. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">We also have a chat enabled in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">the game so when you receive a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">new message. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1385">For that, we use Google Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1385">Messaging for Android. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1387">We use Apple Push Notification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">with Socket. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1390">We use a channel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1390">API on the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1393">We integrate deeply with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1393">Facebook for friend requests </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1396">on all of the API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1399">But really at the centerpiece </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1399">of it all is our App Engine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1402">code written in Python, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1402">it integrates with all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1406">different pieces of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1406">Cloud Platform &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">the Datastore, Memcache, Task </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">Queue, we use all of that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">So let's see what kind of logic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">we have to run because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">at first, it seems like a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">simple game somewhat, but I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1419">think we do a few interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1419">things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1422">On the left, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">see the matching. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1425">So you can, of course, challenge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1425">an opponent on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">Facebook with username and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">email, but we manage to run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">more interesting queries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">on App Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1433">For instance, we have a feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1433">called Best Match. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1436">What it does, it's going to try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">to find an opponent for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1439">you that wants to play with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1439">strangers, that's currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1443">active, that's close to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1443">you geographically &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">so we look at the state and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">even the city level &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">and then we match you on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">music taste because you will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1454">have a way better experience if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1454">you play with someone that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">likes the same kind of music </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">because you're going to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1459">back and forth with music </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1459">you both like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1461">So it was very important. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">After we released this feature, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">we looked at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1465">metrics, and it was very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1465">beneficial for us compared to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">just random matching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">to take user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1472">music tastes into account. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1474">Those kind of things can run on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1474">App Engine even if they are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">very complicated. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1478">On top, we also have lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1478">Playlists to manage and lots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1481">of quizzes to generate. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1483">We have to create hundreds of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">playlists with up to 500 songs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1486">each, and when you generate a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1486">playlist, we have to take into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1489">account you as a player and your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1489">skills in this playlist, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1493">but also the person that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1493">going to receive it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">Based on that, we have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">balance and pick the right set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">of songs that we want. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1501">But I think the most interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">part is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1503">[INAUDIBLE] button because most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1503">games, their results are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1507">on one user in terms of data, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1507">in terms of scalability. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1510">But SongPop is different because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1510">it's purely one versus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1513">one, so most of our data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1513">is between two users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1516">It's what we call the Player </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1516">versus Player, or PvP. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1521">It means that our database is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1521">really a graph structure, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1525">so we store the current quiz </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1525">there, we store a bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">stats on your histories of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">scores and playlists sent. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1532">We store the Chat messages. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1534">So it's a bit of particularity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1534">and we are pretty heavy users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1538">of the back end, both in terms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1538">of data and logic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1542">But to dig even deeper on that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">I'm going to let Alexis </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1545">talk about it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1549"><span class="speakerName">Alexis Hanicotte</span>: So let's first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1549">start with how we define </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1551">our models. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1552">That's pretty straightforward. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1553">We have our user model that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1553">holds the list of playlists he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1557">has purchased. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1558">Then our playlist model, that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1558">just a collection of songs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1562">Then the song model, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1562">belongs to an album that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1565">from an artist. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1566">Then we have this PvP model </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1566">that represent the link </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">between the user and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">the opponent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1571">This holds the current state of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1571">the game and the history of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">the interaction between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">the two users. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">In Google App Engine, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">this translates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1580">directly into the code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1581">For instance, we have to write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">a Playlist class with all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">properties we want on it and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">the type we want for these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1587">properties. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1589">And that's all you need to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1591">Then App Engine will create the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1591">necessary entries into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">Datastore as soon as you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">start using this class. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1599">I would like to go further and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">show what is the real code you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">actually need to write on App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">Engine from when the request </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">hits your back end to when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">can deliver the response. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">To do that, we can do it with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">real example from "SongPop" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1614">that we call user/data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1615">This handler is used to keep the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1615">device up to date, so it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">called every time the user opens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">the application or goes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">back to this main screen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1624">And we have to pull all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1624">active games he has, so it can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">be up to 80 games, and this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">called many times for each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1631">user session. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1632">So that's a critical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">call for us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1634">If it fails, the user can no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1634">longer see what he can play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1639">So what we really have to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1639">is we query for the games, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">that is, all PvP models. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1644">And for each PvP, we have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1644">retrace the playlists linked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">to the current quiz and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">the user model and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">his opponent profile. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">We structure it this way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1655">So first, we fetch the current </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1655">user, then we query for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">list of games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1659">Then we can extract the playlist </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1659">we need from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">games and the user and get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">the opponent's data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1666">Finally, we combine and format </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">everything and send that back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">to the client. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1670">So I will show you, for each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1670">of these steps, how we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">implemented them and why </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">is it efficient. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1677">So let's start with getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1677">the current user. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1680">So we just extract the User ID </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1680">from the incoming requests, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">and then we use a Python </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">NDB API to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">retrieve the user model. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1688">So by just coding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">User.get_by_id. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1693">Why is this efficient? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">Well first, it goes through the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">Cloud Datastore that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1698">designed to be highly scalable, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1698">in fact, it's built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1701">on top of BigTable. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1703">That is what Google uses </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1703">internally for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">some of their products. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1706">But what really makes this line </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1706">efficient is that it goes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1709">through a Memcache layer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1712">So when we call our user/data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1712">handler again, it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1716">directly fetch the user model </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1716">from Memcache, saving us lots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">of time and Datastore </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">operations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1723">Also a nice feature with NDB is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">that the model is added to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1727">the instance memory. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1728">So when you have other parts of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1728">your code that also want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">retrieve this user by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">this ID, you will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1734">directly get the model. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1736">You don't have to manage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">all of that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">Now that we have the current </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">user, we can query for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">list of games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1744">So here is how we write a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1744">query using the NDB API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1749">You can just do that and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1749">works, but that would not be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">very efficient, and that would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">be expensive because this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">doesn't make use of Memcache. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1757">Indeed, NDB can't guess when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1757">each was invalidated, so it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1761">up to you to implement this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1761">but that's still very easy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1766">We just define our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1766">own Memcache key. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1768">Look it up in Memcache. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1770">If it's not there, re-perform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">a query </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1772">and set it into Memcache. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1776">Now that we have the list of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1776">games, we have the keys of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">playlist we need, the keys of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">the opponents we want, so we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1782">can just group all of these keys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1782">and perform one single </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">call to the Datastore to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">retrieve all of the models. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1789">Finally, we just have to process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">all of this data and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">move it into JSON to what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">want to send to the client. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1795">I will just spare </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">you this code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1798">So that's it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1799">We implemented a request </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">handler, and here is what real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">production code looks like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1805">It's about 40 lines of code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1805">to implement this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1807">and optimize this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1809">And this has run billions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">of times serving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1811">over 80 million users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1814">So once we have this code ready, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1814">all we have to do is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1817">hit Deploy and let App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1817">Engine do its work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1821">It will create the necessary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1821">entries into the Datastore, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1824">will spawn the necessary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1824">instances as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1826">your traffic grows. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">So just sit and watch your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">app scale effortlessly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1835">Here are a few more things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">I would like to share, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">especially with App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">Engine developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1839">One of these is make use of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">Memcache wisely because you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1844">will be allocated more space as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1844">your app grows, but that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1847">still limited. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1849">So if you put everything in it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">you will find that it's no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1852">longer efficient when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1852">you reach really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1854">high traffic limits. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1856">One other thing is that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1856">should really only index what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">you really need to query </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">on your models. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">By default, everything is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">indexed, and that's very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1865">convenient. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1866">But if your models are often </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">updated, that will be really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">expensive, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">will significantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1873">increase your bill. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1874">That's just an easy thing to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">do, unindex what you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1877">need to query. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1879">Then don't worry about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">documented quotas on the limit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1883">about App Engine, because they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1883">are just there to make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">one single app doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">abuse any resources. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1889">But actually, for "SongPop," </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1889">most of them have been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1892">increased more than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1892">tenfold for us. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">So App Engine can really scale </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">more than the limits that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">documented. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1901">Finally, we were pleasantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">surprised with the support we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">got with the Premier Accounts. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1907">You get to talk with qualified </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1907">people that are responsive, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1910">and they really give you useful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1910">insights about what is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">going on in your application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1917">So that was for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1917">technical part. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1920">Olivier can continue. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1922"><span class="speakerName">Olivier Michon</span>: So to conclude, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1922">I would like to say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">that App Engine really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">allowed us to scale. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1927">Scale to us, it's not really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1927">about not having to worry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1931">about hardware. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1931">We expect a lot more. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1933">When we worked on "SongPop," </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1933">we worked less than three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1937">months on it with our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1937">own two developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1941">We released it on iOS, Android, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1941">and the web, so we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1943">were on a very tight schedule, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1943">and we had no idea if it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1946">going to succeed or not. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1948">But scaling means that it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1948">very important to us that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">write a line of code the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">way if it's going to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">executed 10 times or 10 billion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">times, like Alexis </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">showed you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1958">Because once we release </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1958">"SongPop," it's when things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1960">really start for us. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">We're not shipping a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">box and move on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1965">We are shipping a first version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1965">of our game, but it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">more of a service. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1969">And actually, most of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1969">efforts we put into SongPop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">were after the launch. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1974">So it's very important, if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1974">want to keep your audience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">engaged, to release features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">and features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1981">Alexis here wrote most of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">back end code all by himself, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1984">and when we started scaling to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1984">five million users, he was not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1988">worried about [INAUDIBLE] the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1988">database or things like that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1990">He was worried about the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">features that we wanted to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">implement to really keep the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">momentum of our game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1995">So this is what scaling means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1995">to us, and I think it's very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1999">important for small </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1999">teams like us. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">Now I would like to mention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">something about cost, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">I think a lot of developers can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">be worried about cost on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">App Engine because it has a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">very different structure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">compared to what you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">see elsewhere. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2013">But I want to tell you that even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2013">for a game like us with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2016">more than 80 million people, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2016">we give the game for free </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2019">to all of our users, we still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2019">manage to make a profit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2023">App Engine is not a prohibitive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2023">cost at all. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2026">In terms of cost to us, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">more of the cost of the missed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2029">opportunities. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2030">What would have happened </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2030">if we had crashed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">when we were growing? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2033">What would have happened if we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2033">took six months or 10 months </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2036">to deliver a full version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2036">of the game? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2039">So this is really what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2039">cost means to us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2042">I would like to say one last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2042">thing, one quick example about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2045">scaling with App Engine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2045">with a little example. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2049">Every week in "SongPop," we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2049">reset the score because we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2052">want to give you a chance, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2052">you lost against your friend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">the previous week, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">win the next week. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2058">So what happens is during a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2058">period of time of around five </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2061">minutes, we have tens of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2061">millions of push notifications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">that are sent to our users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">to re-engage them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2068">It's a great and important way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">for us to re-engage them at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">this point. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2072">But at the same time, what it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2072">does, it's going to have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">huge impact on our traffic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2077">And for less than five minutes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2077">we go from, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2080">say, thousands of queries per </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2080">second to more than 10,000 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">query per second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">on App Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2086">So it's very important to us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2086">that during this time when we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">are re-engaging all of our users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">and preparing them for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">the next week so they have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">a good user experience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">For that, App Engine is perfect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">because it autoscales </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2099">and it autoscales very fast, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2099">which means that it pumps new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">instances very fast because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">they are so lightweight. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2106">So we are pretty confident to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">say is that App Engine was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2109">very instrumental in the success </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2109">of "SongPop," from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">fast prototyping to scale </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">to 8 million users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2117">Last slide. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2119">We are all day in the Sandbox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2119">with Alexis, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2123">it's just over there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2124">Don't hesitate to stop by. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2152"><span class="speakerName">Chris Elliott</span>: It's absolutely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">amazing talking to developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2155">and hearing these same kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2155">stories again and again. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2157">And the fact that it was mainly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2157">one person scaling to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2160">code that executes 11 billion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2160">times without any major </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2163">issues, that's absolutely insane </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2163">and really highlights </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">the benefits of the platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2168">And it was funny how you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2168">threw in the, we are hiring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">note, because we see such a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">huge demand for App Engine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2174">developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2174">If you're a qualified App Engine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2174">developer, please give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">us your resume because we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">tons of people that keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2179">asking us time and time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2179">and time again. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">So it's great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2183">And that saying, code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2183">deploy, and enjoy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2185">When I first read it, that's an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2185">absolutely amazing way of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">phrasing it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2189">And so if you see that at next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2189">I/O as more an official </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">keynote or anything, you'll be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">firsthand witnesses to where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2195">the origin of that saying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2195">comes from. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2198">So last is our final reference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2198">architecture, and this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2202">really dealing with dedicated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2202">game servers on the platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">and harnessing the power </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">of Compute Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2208">And I play mobile games </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2208">all day long. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2213">I realize my boss is here, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">I do play games all day long. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2216">Luckily, it's part of my job. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2217">But when I get home, I sit down, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2217">I boot up my gaming PC, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">and I jump in for some real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">time, competitive, player </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2224">versus player, 64 people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2224">on a battlefield, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2227">all just going crazy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2228">And that is really the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2228">side of gaming that you see a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2231">lot of people having a blast </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2231">with, and that is directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">what we're targeting with this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">reference architecture. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2237">And so it's creating a full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">featured game experience that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2240">has all the functionality you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2240">expect, and once again, being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">scalable in a way that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">makes a lot of sense. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2247">So with that, once again, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">created a sample application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2250">and this is the sample </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2250">application we put together. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">You may recognize GRITS from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">last I/O if you were here or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">watched any of the talks, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">and it's essentially an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2259">application to highlight HTML5 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2259">player versus player NoJS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2263">And we took this core outline, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2263">and then we really applied a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">lot of the scalability concepts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">we're going to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2268">to, to the application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2268">to show you exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">what it looks like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2271">And so we'll jump over to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2271">a demo real quick here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">So this is what it looks like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2276">You basically log in, and you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2276">hitting App Engine, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2278">you can see a bunch of game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2278">servers that are allocated and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2281">how many people are playing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2283">From there, you can directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2283">jump in and do a quick match, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2285">or you can find a game with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2285">reasonable number of players. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2288">So if I'm brand new, I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2288">probably going to want to play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">in a small server just I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">can pick up the game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2292">And from there, you'll notice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2292">we're actually no longer on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">App Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2294">We're actually at the IP address </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">of Compute Engine. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">Obviously, there's lots of ways </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">of doing it, but this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2299">just a very verbose way of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2299">showing you what's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2301">happening under the covers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2302">From there, you jump in, start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2302">a quick game, and all of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2305">assets will be pulled down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2305">from the server &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">so the media, the music, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">all of the graphics &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2310">onto the web browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2310">client here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2313">And while that's happening &mdash; it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2313">usually takes a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2315">longer up here on stage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2315">on the Wi-Fi &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">we also have an admin console </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">that you can log </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2320">into and see here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2321">And this allows you to start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2321">up a cluster, spin down a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323">cluster, and it's also a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323">place to go to experiment with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2326">autoscaling, which we actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2326">implemented in here as well. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2329">So after the average load on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2329">server passes 80%, you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2333">end up adding new servers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2333">automatically and spinning up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2335">to handle the number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2335">of players who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">keep joining the game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2339">So if we jump back, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2339">we should be in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2341">And basically, we're in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2342">So you respond, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2342">it's fairly basic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2345">It's highlighting some cutting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2345">edge web technologies. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2347">I mean, it's developed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2347">by Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2348">We don't have a massive team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2348">of AAA developers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2351">But it kind of highlights </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2351">running around, real time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2353">motion, shooting, et cetera. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2355">A bunch of people can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2355">join in and play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2356">And it's always really funny </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2356">after showing this in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2358">presentation, especially at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2358">Google, usually I look in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2361">afterwards and there's 50 people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2361">playing, even though </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2363">there's somebody else up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2363">presenting afterwards. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2366">It's kind of fun to see people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">get in and really have fun </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2368">with the application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2370">And so jumping back to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">slides, all of this source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2373">code is actually open sourced as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2373">of two days ago, so you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2377">go in, pick it up, start playing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2377">with it, and get a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2379">really quick way to start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2379">scaling on the platform with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2381">dedicated game servers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">And swap in whatever you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">to replace the game assets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">that we provide. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2387">So with the architecture, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2387">big difference here when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2390">look at the devices is it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2390">no longer mobile devices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2393">You're looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2393">everything from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2394">gaming PCs, to web browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2396">It's up to you as a game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2396">developer to really use what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2399">technology makes sense for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2399">game you're developing and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2401">players that will be using it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2403">From that point on to the magic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2403">of Cloud Endpoints, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2405">really connecting to Server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2405">Matchmaking, and this can be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2408">as simple or complex </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2408">as you want. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2410">It could be, I want to play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2410">Capture the Flag with people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2413">of reasonable skill nearby, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2413">have all the matchmaking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2415">logic to make that happen and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2415">return a single IP address to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2418">the client. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2419">Otherwise, you could do things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2419">of just give a large list of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2421">IP addresses in a region and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2421">allow the client to go in, see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2424">which one has a lower latency, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2424">and join whatever map they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">choose to play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2427">That's just one of the many ways </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">of building it out, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2429">the key aspect is App Engine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2429">has a scalable component to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2432">really scale up and provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2432">the technology to power </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2435">whatever type of matchmaking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2435">algorithm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2436">you choose to implement. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">From there, you saw on GRITS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">what we looked at, very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2442">straightforward. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2442">List of IP addresses and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2442">also just Quick Match. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2447">And so from there, this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2447">really where the magic happens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2450">and where a game developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2450">should spend the majority of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2452">their time, is really focusing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2452">on creating the core game play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2456">experience that keeps people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2456">riveted on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2458">edge of their seats. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2459">And so that's really connecting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2459">your game clients </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">to the over full duplex sockets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">to the game engines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2464">running on Compute Engine, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2464">having that real time gaming, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2466">low latency, all the benefits </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2466">of the platform there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2469">really what power these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2469">type of applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2473">And what's really interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2473">here as well is as you start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2475">to grow, you can increase </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2475">capacity in different regions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2477">and you're not necessarily tied </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2477">to being overprovisioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2479">in an area where it turns out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2479">your game is not as popular. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2483">Next up, going back to App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2483">Engine, a lot of cases you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2486">have in game requests. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2487">So it could be something as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2487">simple as at the end of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2489">match, you have a bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2489">players, and you want to keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2492">track of their scores, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2492">kill death ratios, et </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2494">cetera, long term. </span></p>
