<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="22"><span class="speakerName">Chris Lyon</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="22"><span class="speakerName">Andrew Bowers</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="23"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Now, the Chromebook </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">Pixel, it's just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">been one of the best devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">I've ever had. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="27">Just straight out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="29">Chrome OS has really been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">something that's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">intriguing to me for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">a long time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="33">We've really enjoyed having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">the ability to have all my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">content in one place. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="36">And you can switch from computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">to computer, and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">follows you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="40">But for the first time ever, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">this is a device that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">completely designed in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">hardware by Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="46">So I wanted to talk to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">you guys about that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="48">And talk me through that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">process, in terms of how did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">that happen? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">And what were we trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">to achieve? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="54"><span class="speakerName">Andrew Bowers</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">So the first thing we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">trying to do is really just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">create the best Chromebook </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">possible, no holds barred, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">really thinking about someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">who's using a Chromebook all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">day long as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">So a lot of focus, attention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">to detail, on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">how the device feels. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">We really want the hardware </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">to disappear. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">We want to make it feel like an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">immersive movie, where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">forget that you're in a movie </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">theater and you're just really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">focused on what you're doing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">And so part of that's making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">that hardware disappear so you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">don't feel the keyboard, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">trackpad, things like that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="82"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Now, what are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">kind of attributes in hardware </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">that you were trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">to get to? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">How did you decide whether it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">had an 11-inch screen or a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">15-inch screen? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">What were the things where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">made a decision on that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">How do you go about deciding? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="94"><span class="speakerName">Chris Lyon</span>: So for those items, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">when we were setting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">out in the early design process, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">we did a large number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">of user studies on various </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">screen sizes, various </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">configurations, keyboard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">placement, et cetera. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">And a lot of those various </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">parameters all fit together to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">give us the proper shape </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">of the laptop. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">One of the early goals was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">we definitely wanted an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">absolutely full metal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">enclosure. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">It feels very nice hold, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">really solid design. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">But that comes with a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">additional challenges as to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">how you fit all of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">other components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">together inside the system. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="124"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: OK. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="125">And so when I look at this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">having tried the previous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">Chromebook models that were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">plastic, they'd come out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="130">They were very light. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="131">This one has a stronger feel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="133">It's kind of more industrial. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="134">And one of the things that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">happened as a result of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">making, I guess, the ultimate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">Chromebook is it's a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">bit more expensive than the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">original Chromebook. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="143">We've been looking at. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="143">Samsung. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="144">I've got three of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">at my house. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="146">Got one for my wife. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="147">Got one for myself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="148">Got two for my parents. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="149">And they're all $249. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="150">And obviously, the Pixel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">is a different beast. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="152">It's starting at, I think, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">$1,249, and you basically got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">a little bit more expensive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="157">So what was the thought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">behind that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">Was that something where we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">wanted to set it up kind of as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">a reference model? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">Or do we expect these to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">be for the mass market? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="165"><span class="speakerName">Chris Lyon</span>: So Pixel should be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">thought of as a halo device, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">something where we really want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">to showcase a large number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">new technologies that aren't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">necessarily in the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">Chromebooks, but things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">we want developers to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">experiment with &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">things like the high pixel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">density touchscreen, things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">like keyboard backlight. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="183">I'm not sure if you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">aware, but there's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">microphone array in here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="187">There's two up top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">for beam forming. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="189">There's noise cancellation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="191">There's the LTE. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="194">This is the first Chromebook </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">with that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="195">And again, these are a number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">features where the hardware </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">has to lead the software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">a bit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="199">We have to get the features out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">there, build a critical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">mass of users, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">encourage the developers to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">target those features. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="207"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: You mentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">the high screen density. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="209">One thing about the Pixel is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">that you shouldn't have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">ever see a pixel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="212">I mean, that's sort of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">we've been talking about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="214">You say Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="215">You want to get the Chrome out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">of the way, the browser, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">really have the user be directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">interfacing with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">their data, with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">their content. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="221">I'm glad you mentioned LTE. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="222">I'm actually on LTE right now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="225">The Wi-Fi at the conference has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">been really exceptional. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="228">It goes up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="229">It goes down. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="229">There's a lot of people fighting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">for attention, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">I've really cut through all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">of that by getting on LTE. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="234">And having it on this type of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">a device has really been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">exceptional. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="237">And so when I look at the Pixel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">specifically, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">really those three things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">that have set it apart &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">the inclusion of the LTE, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">high density pixel screen, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">the touch aspect of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="248">Now, touch is something you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">traditionally accept with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">tablet or a mobile phone. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="252">What was the thought process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">behind having a touchscreen? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">And how are we seeing users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">behave with the touchscreen, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">or possibly developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">coding for it? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="261"><span class="speakerName">Andrew Bowers</span>: So I think that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">you hit on it right there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">which is touchscreens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">are becoming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">pervasive in our lives. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="266">So they're on your phone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="267">They're on tablets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="268">They're even on ATMs and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">the gas station pumps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="271">And so if you look at children </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">interacting with a laptop, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">they've probably used their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">parents' phone or their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">tablet, and so they're touching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">the screen already. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="279">And so it's just a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">intuitive way versus an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">indirect on a trackpad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">or a mouse. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="285">And so we're seeing it become </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">more and more pervasive, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">we think of it as yet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">another way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">interact with the computer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="291">It's not the only way you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">interact with a laptop, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">it's another way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="293">So to give you an example, on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">Tuesday I spent five hours on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">a plane, a cramped seat. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="298">But I could hold my Pixel like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">this, and I could scroll and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">archive email on the plane </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">much more easily. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="304"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: The viewers at home </span><span class="line" data-startTime="304">can't see your hands. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="307"><span class="speakerName">Andrew Bowers</span>: That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">a good point. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">So a lot of times, you'll find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">you'll use something in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">different way. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">Like for instance, when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">cramped in on plane, using it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">like this rather than having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">to use the trackpad. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">So it opens up new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">opportunities. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="321"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="321">Absolutely. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="321">And I've seen that a lot. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="322">There's one really cool thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">that you get the right screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">combination, you can rotate the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">entire screen 90 degrees </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">or 180 degrees to be fixed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="329">And literally, you look at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">Chromebook right side up, even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">if it's on its side, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">is kind of entertaining. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="335">And so for a lot of people who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">have like a vertical monitor, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">I can see them possibly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">extending out and having that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">vertical monitor. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="341">And the processor in here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">strong enough that they can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">push all those pixels even in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">that new configuration. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="348">So I want to talk a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">bit about the speed. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="349">This is obviously faster. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="351">It's faster. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="352">It's brighter. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="353">It's got a lot of attributes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">to it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="355">So what about the speed? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">How did that come into play? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="357"><span class="speakerName">Chris Lyon</span>: So we designed the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">Pixel to be Chrome fast. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="359">The idea here was hardware </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">should not get in the way of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">the experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="363">We wanted this to be able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">show off the browser and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">operating system as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">well as possible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="369">This is an Intel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">i5 CPU in here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="372">There's four gigabytes of RAM, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">pretty standard other features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">internally aside from that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="378">But it's more than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">enough for web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">applications, for HTML5 games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="386">And it should actually enable a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="386">significant amount of future </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">development coming there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="391">One of the things we're really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">excited about is HTML5 games </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">are becoming more and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">more popular. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="395">And actually, we're seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">developers make use of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">touchscreen, of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">high PPI display. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="400">And we're really hoping that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">as we can build more of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">critical mass of systems out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">there with those features that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">people will be implementing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">more and more higher end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="410">So we really wanted to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">sure that it had the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">horsepower under the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">hood there to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">able to handle that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="414"><span class="speakerName">Andrew Bowers</span>: And just to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">add to that real quick. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">I think one of the ways we also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">think about is not we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">don't want consumers to have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">think about what processor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">do they have in the machine. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">We just want it to be, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">it fast enough for what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">I want it to do? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">And so we want to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">to that world too. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="428"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: And one of things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="428">that I've experienced having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">the touchscreen on the laptop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">is you can have more of an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">immersive experience, be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">it with Maps or Photos. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">There's something really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">breathtaking about diving into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">Google Maps or the Google+ </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">Photos experience and just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">being able to pinch to zoom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">and getting right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">into what you want. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">And you just swipe to the side </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">and have it go away. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">And it's something that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">really become natural. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">It's one of those funny things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">about having a glossy screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">that you touch all the time. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">I was in the car the other day </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">making a quick web change &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">I was on LTE &mdash; and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">saw my fingerprints </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">all over the screen. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">How do you guys handle just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">managing that type of thing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">where you get a little bit dirty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">and you clean it off? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">So what do you think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">that kind of stuff? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="463"><span class="speakerName">Andrew Bowers</span>: It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">called a cloth. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="465"><span class="speakerName">Chris Lyon</span>: It is actually a big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">engineering challenge, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">it is something that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">put a fair amount of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">work into with Pixel. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">Obviously, there's still a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">long ways to go in that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">direction, and it's something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">we're continuing to research. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="475"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Yeah, it's one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">of those fun things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">And you don't realize how often </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">you touch it until you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">get the little bit of glare, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">you're like wow, I touch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">this thing all the time. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">You've got the hands on there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="482"><span class="speakerName">Chris Lyon</span>: One of the nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">things though &mdash; the screen is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">Gorilla Glass coating, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">just very resilient. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">So at least even if you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">smudging it, you don't have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">worry about damaging it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="492"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: What I find is I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">often am reaching to other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">people's computers and expecting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">that I can impact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">the touchscreen. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">And I'm like, are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">you kidding me? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">Why are you using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">that product? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="500"><span class="speakerName">Chris Lyon</span>: Actually, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">been an interesting problem in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">the office. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">So when we were using these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">initially internally a lot, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">people got in the habit of when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">they'd written an email </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">then just pushing the Send or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">the Compose button on there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">And you'd see people walking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">around when this was still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">secret and we couldn't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">them in every meeting. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">And they'd have their ThinkPad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">out, and they'd push the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">screen, and they'd get mad. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="517"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Nothing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">would happen. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="518"><span class="speakerName">Chris Lyon</span>: Definitely a number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">of our vendors and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">partners probably caught </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">on to that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="522"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: We have like five </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">minutes left, so I want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">talk a little about Chrome OS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="525">Now, you know Chrome OS is still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">a little bit new for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">lot of people, and it's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">kind of growing in maturity in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">terms of the capability. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="530">Every time Chrome gets better, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">Chrome OS gets better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="534">And about two years ago &mdash; maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">it was even three at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">this point &mdash; with the Cr-48 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">model coming out, really kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">of the first reference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">point of having a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">Chrome device out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="542">It wasn't super fast. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="544">There were some aspects of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">hardware which were not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">perfect, but it was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">fun reference point. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="548">And since then, we've continued </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">to see iterations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">from Chrome via devices from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">Samsung, Lenovo, HP, Acer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="555">I hope I've mentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">them all. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="557">And you've seen people come up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">with different price points </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">and different sizes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="560">Now, what has been your kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">response to see how Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">OS is evolving? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">And what is left? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">What is kind of the last things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">that the Chrome OS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">should be doing, where people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">can really safely leave more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">traditional operating systems? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="576"><span class="speakerName">Andrew Bowers</span>: So the Samsung </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">Chromebook has been the number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">one laptop on Amazon for about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">190 days since its launch, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">consecutively. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">And so I think that speaks for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">itself in terms of what people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">are ready for. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">With the Pixel, we've taken it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">a step further as well in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">terms of there are a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">people that wanted high-end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">hardware, precision hardware. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">They spend 10 hours a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">day on a Chromebook. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">And so when we say for everyone, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">we don't just mean </span><span class="line" data-startTime="601">people that want a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="601">affordable laptop, but also a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">precision experience with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">great keyboard and trackpad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">and touchscreen. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">And so with the Pixel, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">bringing that as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">So you cover different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">needs out there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="613">for different people. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="614"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Sure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="614">And I think you're mentioning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">that you say for everyone, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">it's also for everything. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="618">As someone who's very Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">Drive-centric, with all of my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">files and my applications there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">going to Gmail, going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">to my Google+, I really believe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">at this point every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">computer is my computer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="629">So long as I can get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="629">to my Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">content, it's all there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="632">But actually, I'd much rather </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">be using a Pixel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="634">If you handed me a ThinkPad, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="634">I'd be fine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="636">I'd be able to boot up Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">and do all my work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="638">But with the Pixel, it just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">has such kind of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">professional, high quality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="642">You don't want to suffer the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="642">screen display of something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">else which isn't as strong. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="646">And even just the little bits </span><span class="line" data-startTime="646">with like the keys and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">hardware and the trackpad are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">so professionally designed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="652">And so I think you can really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">see that, for those people who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="654">do get an opportunity to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="654">get their hands on it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">to check that out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="657">So for the many people who are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">watching on the livestream, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">how do they get their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">hands on a Pixel? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="662"><span class="speakerName">Andrew Bowers</span>: So they can go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">to the Google Play store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">online or bestbuy.com as well. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="667"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: And Best Buy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="667">has them in display. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="668">I remember that's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="668">where I bought the three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">Samsung Chromebooks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">that I got. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="672">I almost cleaned them out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="674">And I think I sold five other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">ones in the 10 minutes I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">there just playing demo. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="678">And so I think it's great that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">you have the Pixels out there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">getting really big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">distribution. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="682">Anything else that the viewers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">should know about the Pixel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">before we cut? </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="686"><span class="speakerName">Andrew Bowers</span>: I think that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">really have to experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">it to understand what it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">is and what it means. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">And I think it brings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">Chromebooks to a whole other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">level of user that want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">to use Chromebooks. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">And so we hope that it'll open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">up a lot of opportunities for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">people to experience Chromebooks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">and how easy they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">are to use and how great it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">is to live with them. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="706"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Well, thank you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">very much, both for you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="708">joining me on stage and for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="708">all the work that you did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">putting into this product. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="712">It's obviously something I use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">every single day, not just at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">the conference. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="715">And I constantly run into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">my kids saying, hey, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">Daddy, look at that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="718">And they'll click on my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="718">touchscreen and accidentally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="720">click on an ad or something. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="721">But they understand exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">how to interface with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">touchscreen, because they've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">been growing up with tablets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="725">And we're seeing really the next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">generation of personal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="728">computing happen right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="728">in front of us. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="729">So thank you very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">much for that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="730"><span class="speakerName">Chris Lyon</span>: Thank you. </span></p>
