<p><span class="line" data-startTime="0"> TENG: Hi there, my name is Karen Teng, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">and I lead the development effort over at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">Adaptive Blue. Adaptive Blue is a New York-based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">startup, focused on using semantic technologies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">to create a better web browsing experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="13"> What is your extension about? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17"> TENG: Get Glue is an innovative social </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">recommendation network from movies, books, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">and music. The Get Glue browser extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">brings filtered friend reviews, personal recommendations, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">and contextual content to popular sites around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">the web, such as Wikipedia, Amazon, IMDB, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">and hundreds more. Get Glue can understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">that you're on a page about a recognized object, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">like a movie, book, or album. When that happens, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">it calls the Get Glue API, which then determines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">which object it is. The Get Glue API also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">returns information about that object, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">core information, recent visitors, and similar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">things. The output from these calls are then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">transformed via XSL to create the HTML of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">the Get Glue bar. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="57"> How does Glue determine what is currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">being viewed by the user? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60"> TENG: Each object on Get Glue has its own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">identifier that is generated from its primary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">key attributes. These key attributes are category </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">specific. For example, books can be identified </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">by title and author, and movies by title and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">director. When somebody visits a book on a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">recognized site, we extract the title and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">author from the page, and query a semantic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">database to find a match. Querying a centralized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">and authoritative source helps us normalize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">across different spellings and editions to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">ensure that the same book across sites is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">recognized. Semantic DBs are also category </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">specific. For example, we use Amazon for books </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">and Netflix for movies. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="97"> Why do Glue's social features belong in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">the browser? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98"> TENG: The browser acts as a lens as the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">user surfs around the web. And this lens is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">an ideal layer to introduce contextually correct, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">highly relevant information for the user. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="109">Social connections happen to be a specific </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">type of contextual information that can be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">surfaced by the browser. Get Glue is capable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">of understanding the context of a page, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">is then able to pull in the right contextual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">information from across the web automatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">onto the page. The extension pulls information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">that provides the best experience for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">user, regardless of what the website operator </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">wants to surface on their page. For example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">when a user looks at a movie on Amazon, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">cannot only see filtered friend reviews for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">that movie, via the Get Glue extension, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">they can also watch the trailer, or add it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">directly to their Netflix queue. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="146"> What was your experience like developing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">a Google Chrome extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149"> TENG: We found that developing an extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">for Chrome was a different experience than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">doing it for Firefox and Internet Explorer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="153">The main difference is in the philosophy and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">the architecture of Chrome add-ons, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">in turn guided us to a different kind of implementation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="162">Get Glue is a sophisticated add-on, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">includes semantic analysis of information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">on the pages, focuses on the content of hundreds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">of popular sites, and surfaces friends' recommendations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="172">Basically, it wasn't exactly trivial, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">the port to Chrome required substantial effort. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="178">Our main focus was on preserving a common </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">code base between the browsers while fitting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">into Chrome's model of background pages and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">content scripts. Once we've figured out the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">best way to re-factor our code to make the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">two sides communicate, the process became </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">straightforward. Overall, we found the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">platform to be very flexible easy to code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">on. The documentation forms were excellent. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="195"> How did your vision evolve as you were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">working on your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202"> TENG: Since we already had a working extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">for Firefox and Internet Explorer, our main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">focus was on building the Chrome extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">in a way that fit our architecture, and reuse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">most of the code. Throughout the process, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">we've focused on optimizing our code, ensuring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">that the extension worked quickly and did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">not degrade the user's main experience, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">is surfing the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="218"> What were some challenges you faced when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">writing your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221"> TENG: One area that gave us trouble when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">porting the extension was that there was an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">architectural mismatch. Our code was relying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">on synchronous calls which were impossible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">within Chrome. So, we mimicked the behavior </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">of synchronous requests by creating a cache </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">facade within the content script. This is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">done based on the suggestion from the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">team, who was very helpful throughout the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">entire process of the port. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="242"> How did you promote your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242"> TENG: It's important for an extension developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">to find additional promotional opportunities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">beyond the great value that the extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">gallery provides. Promoting the extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">on the Get Glue website has definitely helped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">with adoption. We show a specific "add to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">your browser button" for Chrome users that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">includes a Chrome logo, and we've heard that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">the familiarity helps them convert. The Get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">Glue service rewards users for specific achievements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">by awarding them with stickers. Individuals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">are prompted to add the extension in order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">to earn a unique sticker called "add-on adhesive". </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="274"> What advice can you give someone before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">starting to work on a Google Chrome extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279"> TENG: The advice is to think about whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">they're building a cross-browser solution, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">or just for Chrome. If the extension is for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">Chrome only, then it should be designed to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">take maximum advantage of Chrome's infrastructure, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">and native UI. If the goal is to build a cross-browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">solution, then a lot more time needs to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">spent in the architectural phase and making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">sure that mismatches between the platforms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">are understood and accounted for. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="302"> What are the next steps for your extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">and your involvement with the platform? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306"> TENG: We're solely focused on a single </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">Get Glue extension. We follow an aggressive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">release schedule and are routinely shipping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">updates for the extension. It's great that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">Chrome makes the upgrade process so seamless </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">for us, so that we can be confident that everybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">is on the most recent version. We've upgraded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">twice already and both times, it's been seamless </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">and awesome. </span></p>
