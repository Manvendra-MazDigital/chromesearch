<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1"><span class="speakerName">Ankit Jain</span>: Good morning, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1">everyone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3">Morning. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="4">So great to see so many of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">here so early on day three of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">Google I/O. Last night I wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">sure if I was going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="11">make it this early. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="14">My name is Ankit Jain and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">I lead [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">Search & Discovery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">for Google Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="18">And I'm extremely excited to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="18">be here and share this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">material with you today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="22">As most of you know, we've never </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">discussed our search or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">discovery engines publicly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">before today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="29">But before I get started, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">wanted to get to know you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">a little better. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="32">So with a raise of hands, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">many of you are making money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">on Google Play today? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">OK, great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="39">How many of you would like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">to make even more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">money on Google Play? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">Great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="44">For those on YouTube, pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">much everyone would like to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">make even more money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="49">Let's step out of our normal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">role as developers or business </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">owners, and for a second, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">step into the shoes of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">our users, and think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">like a user when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">you come to the store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="58">How many of you have installed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">an app, just while browsing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="61">You were bored, you opened the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">Play Store, saw something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">interesting, click through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">and installed it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">OK, how many of you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">installed an app because you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">thought about, I need to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">something done, I need a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">recipe app or I need to find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">the train schedule, went </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">looked for it, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">installed it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="80">That's a smaller portion. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="83">And how many of you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">installed an app because a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">friend of yours told you, hey, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">you really have to go check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">out this app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="88">And then you go to the Store, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">look for it, and install it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="91">Great, so my goal today is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">talk to you about how we try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">to bring these online and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">offline thought processes of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">how all of us install apps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">and how we try to get that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">discovered on Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="103">So I'm going to present you with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">three high-level sets of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">information. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="106">The first one is our vision for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">the new Google Play Store, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">the second is some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">details of the Search & </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">Discovery algorithms that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">have, and how you can take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">advantage of them to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">discovered more, and, finally, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">I want to leave you with five </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">very concrete examples of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">you can do to get discovered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">more on Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="124">Sounds good? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">All right, great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="126">So let's get right into it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="128">A few weeks ago, we rolled out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">the new version of the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">Play Store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="132">It's very different than what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">we had in the past. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="134">About a year ago a group of us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">stepped aside and said, if we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">could re-imagine the entire </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">Store, the new Google Play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">experience, what would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">it be like? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">The goal was to come up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">something that was dynamic, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">very fresh, the user should be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">trained and look forward to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">coming back into the Store, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">something that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">personalized, yet personal. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="155">So some of you might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">be thinking, Ankit, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">what are you saying? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">Personalized, yet personal, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">what's the difference there? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">Well, personalized to me is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">something that is personally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="164">relevant, related to what you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="164">told us in the past, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">what you users have purchased; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">what's personally relevant, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">because it's popular in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">user's area; personally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">relevant because the user has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">shown interest in certain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">categories or in certain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">developers; or personally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">relevant because your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">friends are showing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">interest in those things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="183">And then we want to take it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">the next level, we want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">make it personal by showing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">you and annotating each of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">these recommendations or each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">of the pieces of content in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">our Store with why you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">should get it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="193">This could be a +1 by a friend, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">this could be a review </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">by a friend, or this could be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">something based on the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">Google Play Game services. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="199">That should be and three others </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">are currently playing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">"Puzzles and Dragons." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">We should really tell the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">this is why you should get. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="207">And our goal was to help each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">and every one of you, each and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">every one of our developers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">to get more engaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">installers, because at the end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">of the day, that's what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">really going to move </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">the needle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="216">Those are the users that build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">sustainable and great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">businesses. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="220">So our goal was threefold. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="223">First, to help our users find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">what they're looking for as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">effortlessly and seamlessly, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">and possible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="228">Second, to help Android ship </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">more and more beautiful apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="233">And finally, to help all of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">build even more thriving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">businesses on top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">of our platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="241">So let's get the meat </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">of today's talk. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="244">Let's talk about our major </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">install source. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="246">At the end of the day, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">nothing can be built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">unless you've got installs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="249">And specifically, I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">to talk about how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">to get engaged installs. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="252">So many of you reached out to me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">in the past and said, hey, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">I'm ranked number five, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">number 10, or number 50 on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">these top lists, or on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">these trending lists. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="262">These are what I call our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">browsing discovery features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="265">And I like to break them into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">three sub-components. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="268">The first are these top charts, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">the top list, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">editor's picks, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">trending lists. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="272">The next are the features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">that we launched at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">Google I/O last year. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="276">These were the personalized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">recommendations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="278">Some of you saw these as part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">of the Google Play homepage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">experience in the cluster there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">others might have seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">this on the widgets, on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">Nexus 7 and the Nexus 10 on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">the home screens there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="289">And the last set of features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">that we have for discovery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">based on your context, are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">related and cross sell items. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="297">These are the users who viewed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">x, also viewed y on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">details page of all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">of your app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="302">Also the other set which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">users who installed this app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">also installed these other apps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">which is also on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">details pages. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="308">And we'll get into details about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">each of these and how we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">look at them, and how the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">algorithms are built. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="314">What most developers don't think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">to think about as much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">is the search component. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="318">And for the average app search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">actually makes up the vast </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">majority of installs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="323">And when I think about search, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">I like to break it down and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">look at our query stream in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">terms of two kinds of queries. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="330">The first are the kinds of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">queries that many of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">raised your hand for, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">are I had to get something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">done, so I looked it up; I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">needed to look up a recipe; I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">wanted to find restaurant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">reviews in a city that I'm in; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">I want to find multiplayer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">games or free </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">games, or RPG games &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">the kind of categorical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">queries. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="347">You know the general idea of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">what you want or what you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">to do, and then you search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">to find the right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">app to fulfill that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="356">The second kind of query is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">when you know exactly what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">you're looking for. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="360">This is when a friend has told </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">you about an app, or if you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">heard about it through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">marketing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="364">Navigational queries, hey, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">want to get hotel tonight; I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">want to get "Beautylish," or I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">want to get "Angry Birds," </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">which is not necessarily a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">single app, it could be a set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">of apps, but you know which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">direction you want to look in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="376">That's navigational queries. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="379">And just to show you how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">important search is, in any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">given day 12% of our active </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">users come back to the Store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="386">and search at least </span><span class="line" data-startTime="386">once for apps. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="389">In any given week, half of our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">users come to our Store and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">search for apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="394">And even given the number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">apps we have in any given </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">month, there's over six million </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">unique phrases that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">are being searched for. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="401">So really thinking about search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">is important, as you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">try to figure out how to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">get discovered on Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="408">So just to put what we've talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">about, we've talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">about our vision for Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">Play, and how our goal is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">present each user with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">personalized play made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">personal; how Search and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">Browse are the two main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">sources of installs in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">Store; and finally, a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">this happens because our goal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">is to bring the rest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">of Google to Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="427">That was the transition from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">Android Market into Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">Play, it was to integrate all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">of our systems together and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">make Google Play a very smart </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">Store, make it your store. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="438">So now that we've talked about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">it, let's step back and think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">about how we think of our Search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">& Discovery systems. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="444">When we build our search engines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">and our discovery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">engines, we have two options &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">either we can spend a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">time trying to detect the apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">that are bad or spammy, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">simply annoying, or we can spend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">a lot of time trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">figure out which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">apps are good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="457">And we spend a lot more time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">focusing on what's good, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">because if we can promote the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">apps that are not just good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">from what we can tell, based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">on your APK, based on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">metadata, based on what users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">are telling us about each of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">the apps, then other users are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">also going to find these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">delightful experiences. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="474">And so this part of the talk is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">going to be talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">how you can compliment your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">with good app metadata. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="482">So the most important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">piece of your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">metadata is your title. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="486">It's important to be creative, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">but it's just as important, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">not more important, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">been very clear. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="493">So this example up on screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">is about an app named </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">"Beautylish." As you can see, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">most of you might not have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">heard of it, some of you might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">have heard of it, but right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">after you see the title, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">know this app is about makeup </span><span class="line" data-startTime="505">and beauty tips. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="507">So what this title helps you do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="507">is it helps the developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">reinforce, not just their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">branding, but also what their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">app is about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="516">So as you see this more and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">more often, either in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">Store, or even once you have it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">installed in your list of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">apps on your home screen, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">very clear that "Beautylish" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">is the app I go to for makeup </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">and beauty tips. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="527">So I highly recommend thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">about the name of your app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="531">It also helps a lot for SEO. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="533">When someone looks up "beauty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">tips" or "makeup tips", these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">guys are at the top of that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">list, just because everyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">associates the two of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">terms together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="544">The next important part of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">your details page in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">metadata is your description. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="550">You can write as long a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">description as you want, but I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">always say, get the main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">message out first. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="557">"Star Chart" does a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">great job here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="558">Their first sentence says that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">you can now have a virtual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">planetarium in your pocket. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="563">Again, if you've never used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">this app, you already know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">what it's about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="566">After that, you can go on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">describe it in more detail, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">list the awards you have, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">just have your sales and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">marketing pitches for users. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="574">But right up front, make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">sure your user knows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">what your app is about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="579">And on a smaller phone, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="579">the part that's above the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">fold, so you want to make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">on that first screen itself </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">it's extremely clear what your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">goal is &mdash; what utility you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">provide or what entertainment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">value or whatever the goal of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">your app is &mdash; what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">it provides. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="593">Now, that also again helps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">a lot with getting found. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="596">This app is extremely optimized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">for star charts, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">star maps, virtual planetariums, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">so the beginning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">of descriptions are extremely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">important, both from a user's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">perspective, and also from our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">search engine's perspective. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="610">The next couple of slides I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">going to talk about how you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">can use your app details page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">to mimic the real user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">experience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="618">It's important that you set the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">expectations of your user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">to be very realistic to really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">be what your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">is going to be like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="625">The first place to do this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">is in your screenshots. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="628">In our developer console, we let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">you upload screenshots for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="631">tablets, for phones, and really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="631">show the user what it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="634">going to be like once </span><span class="line" data-startTime="634">you install the app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="636">Now, if you don't do this, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">your app experience is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">actually very different from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">your screenshots, it can have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="642">a very negative effect on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="642">all of your systems. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="644">Why? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">Because, well, the user loves </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">what they see in your details </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">page, they install your app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">they open the app, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">they see something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">very different. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="652">What are they going to do? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="654">Well, most users will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="654">uninstall the app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="657">Some of those users will go back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">to the Store and give you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">a low rating, maybe even write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">you a negative review. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="662">And that negative feedback cycle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">is going to hurt you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">more than help you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="666">And so really thinking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">how do you present the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">with, setting the right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">expectation and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="672">delivering on it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="674">That's the message here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="675">We're looking for apps that do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">deliver on their promises. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="679">Video previews are the next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">level of screenshots. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="684">With a short video you're able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">to show the user really what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="687">it's like to play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="687">with your app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="690">And developers have told us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">that uploading a video can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">really help gain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">user adoption. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="695">And users in a lot of studies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">have told us that video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="697">previews are amongst the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="697">convincing features of an app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">details page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="702">Again, the whole goal here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">is to tell your user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">what your app does. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="706">If you can convince them and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">make sure and communicate what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">your app promises and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">deliver on it, you're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">delight them, and they're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">to recommend you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">other users as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="719">So I talked about reviews and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">ratings in terms of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">feedback loop. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="722">And this is a key part of our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="722">Search & Discovery experience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="726">Now, the first piece of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="726">comes because people come back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">and review your app, whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">it's good or bad. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="732">The second piece is we really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">try to order our reviews and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">ratings in an order that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">relevant to the user. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="739">So you're going to see reviews </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">that are on the same device as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">the current user, in the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">country as the current user, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">and as time goes on, people that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">are in a user's circle or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">people that the users trust are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">going to come at the top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">of these reviews. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="751">So investing in making sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">your users are reviewing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">and rating your apps will be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">key going forward, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="758">that's a very strong signal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="758">for us at Google Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="762">So I'm going to step back and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">tell you a story about a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">developer, a developer in India </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">that I was talking to a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">few weeks ago. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="768">And his goal was to target </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">the rural population. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="772">As you can see on the graph </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">on the right, about 75% of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">India's population lives </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">in rural cities. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="778">But his goal was to target the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">audience that had low- to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">mid-end phones, and was on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">slow to 2G networks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="785">So he had really optimized his </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">app to give a delightful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="788">experience for these users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="791">But then he reached out to me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">and said, Ankit, when I look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">at my reviews, I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">this polarized view. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="796">There's a whole bunch of stars </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">with people saying I could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">never have imagined technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">would change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="802">my world this way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="803">And also a lot of one stars, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="803">with people saying, complete </span><span class="line" data-startTime="807">crap, I can't believe I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="807">downloaded this, uninstalling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">it right now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="812">And he was perplexed, he wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">sure what was going on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="814">And we dug a little deeper. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="816">And one of the things we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">noticed was that he was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="818">getting a lot of positive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="818">reaction from the people in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">rural areas, his target </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">audience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="824">And he was getting a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="824">negative reviews from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">people on the 4G networks, on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">the top-of-the-line devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">because his app just was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">not designed for them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="833">His goal was not to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">after that market. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="835">And so the thing that he ended </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">up doing was he went to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">developer console and targeted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">his app to the countries and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">carriers where his target </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">audience really was. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="844">And since then, he's already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="844">seen an uptick in his average </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">reading and his reviews, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">and hopefully that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="849">continues over time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="850">But my message here to you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="850">is think about who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">you're trying to target. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="854">For most apps, you don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="854">to worry about this, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">let your app get to everybody. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="857">But if your app is targeted at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">a specific set of the target </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">audience, make sure those are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">the people helping you get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">even more adoption. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="866">You don't want people not in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">your target audience polluting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">your reviewer rating. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="874">So we've talked about creating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">a very creative, yet clear </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">message to your title and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">description, to mimic your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="880">real world experience through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="880">your images, your screenshots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="883">and your video previews; and, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="883">finally, really about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">understanding your audience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="887">This is what's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="887">help you optimize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">your app details page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="894">So let's see how this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">manifests itself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="896">At the end of the day, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="896">the top charts and the search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">engines, what are the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">that we look for? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="900">How, once you do all of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="900">great things in your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">details page, how does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">it feedback? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">And no search or discovery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">system would be complete </span><span class="line" data-startTime="908">without really taking into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="908">account the statistics that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">we're constantly collecting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="913">So the first piece of this, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">most of you probably already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">figured out, are the installs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="917">Of course, we care about how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">many installs each app has. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="920">The more you have, the higher up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="920">in the rankings you'll go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="923">We also care about how many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">uninstalls you have, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">that's a metric for us to know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">whether users are having a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="929">good or a bad experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="930">Now, some of you are game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">developers out there, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="933">might say, hey, my game overall </span><span class="line" data-startTime="933">takes 1 gig of memory, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">or 2 gigs of memory on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">a person's device. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="939">So after they're done playing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">my game, of course, they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="941">going to uninstall my app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="941">because they want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">play the next game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="945">They've already won every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="945">level there is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="947">Why are you going to hurt me? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">And that's why we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">the third statistic, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">which is long installs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="951">If a person plays through or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="951">uses an app for a long period </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">of time, we don't want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">to penalize it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="956">Our goal is really to detect the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">behavior which is, hey, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">installed the app, I really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">did not have a good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">experience, so I'm installing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">it right away. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">Last year at Google I/O we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">launched Personalized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1464">Recommendations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1467">As I said, these were on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">home screen of the Google Play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1469">homepage and they've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1469">performing extremely well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1471">And with the new launch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1471">Google Play, we really decided </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">to double down on this and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">start personalizing many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1478">different parts of our system. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1480">So I thought it's a good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">opportunity for me to tell you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1482">what really we look for. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1483">We have over 80 signals not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">just from Google Play, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1487">also from the rest of Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1489">But some of our major signals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1489">include apps that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">complementary and supplementary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">to apps that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1494">users installed in the past. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1495">We look at apps that are popular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">in the user's area. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">We look at apps that are being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">+1'd by a user's circles. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1501">Apps that were reviewed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">by a user's circles. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1504">We also look at apps that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1504">developed by some of you, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1507">the users are already showing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1507">interest in your developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1510">account, by other apps by you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1513">So here are some recommendations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1513">for three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1516">different users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1517">You can see +1s by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">people's friends. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1519">You can see apps that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1519">similar to other things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">they've bought, also apps that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">are popular in their area. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1525">So how does this manifest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1525">itself? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1527">So this is the homepage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1527">that we envision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1531">This is going to start rolling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1531">out to different users over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1534">the coming months. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1535">On the left, is my grandmother's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1535">home page, that' </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1539">what she sees. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1540">She grew up very close to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1540">military quarters in India, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1544">because my grandpa lived </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1544">in that area. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1546">And she was very interested </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1546">in getting stuff done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1551">We call her the colonel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1551">of the family. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1552">So for her actually the tasklist </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1552">makes so much sense. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1556">But growing up in a military </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">area also means that you play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1560">a lot of cards. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1561">She actually plays two to four </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1561">hours of card games a day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1564">It's ridiculous, I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">know how she does it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">Imagine the user researches </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">for free games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1649">If we know that they like word </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">games, showing them free word </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1652">games makes a lot of sense. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1654">If they like RPG games, showing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1654">them those kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">games is going to help get a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">much faster acquisition rate. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1662">For train schedules, a user in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1662">New York should get the subway </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">train schedule, a user in San </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">Francisco should get either </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">the BART train schedule or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">the Caltrain schedule. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1671">It just makes sense. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1672">And so over the coming months, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1672">we're going to roll out more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">experiments. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1676">And, finally, to everybody, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1676">personalization across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">categorical searches. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1681">So I've thrown a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1681">things at you so far. </span></p>
