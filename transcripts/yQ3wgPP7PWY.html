<p><span class="line" data-startTime="34">A lot of the features that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">you'll see next have really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">been developing by working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">with you, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">getting your feedback. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="41">So let's continue that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="42">Let's continue that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">conversation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="43">Keep sending the feedback &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">the good, the bad, the ugly &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">and we promise we'll keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">working on it, and making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">things better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="50">We'll start off with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">office hours, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">happening next. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="53">So come on by the Google Play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">office hours section, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">we'll talk there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="57">So the agenda for today, we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">first share some data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="61">These are metrics that we feel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">are interesting for you as you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">build your business </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">on Google Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="65">Well then give you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">a product update. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="67">These are features we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">launched recently and their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">impact, as well as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">things we look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">forward to in the mid-term. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="73">Finally, we'll talk about some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">case studies about what some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">of our most commercially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">successful partners are doing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="78">And finally, we'll close out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">with a Q&A at the office hours </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">by the Google Play section. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="85">All right, so let's get started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">with some data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="90">Last year, Chris Yeager </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">got on stage &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">I think exactly this room &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">and showed us the growth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">trajectory of in-app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="96">It looked something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">like ridiculous &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">well, reversed, but growing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">up to the right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="100">And we were very excited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">about that growth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="102">This year, we've actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">done something even more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">incredible, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">that we multiplied </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">in-app revenue by seven. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="109">So over the past 12 months, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">there are very few industries, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">countries, anything that grows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">that fast over 12 months. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="117">And is a testament to all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">work you've all been doing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="120">Users are engaged with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">applications you're building, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">and they're willing to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">pay for them, and are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">really enjoying them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="126">And so that's just incredible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="128">So we wanted to look beyond the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">number, and say what is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">this telling us about the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">Play and Android user? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">And one thing we've learned &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">and we've heard this a lot from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">our Japanese partners &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">which is omotenashi. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="140">And what omotenashi means in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">Japanese is essentially, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">hospitality, but it's got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">a bit of a deeper sense. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="146">It's got more of a personalized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="149">It's almost like not a buyer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">and seller relationship. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="152">It's a host and a guest. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="154">And what this is is essentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">what in-app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">represents, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">I mean in-app is about getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">the user to enjoy the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">application, to really get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">immersed into it before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">getting to monetization. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="164">We've heard this a lot in all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="164">sorts of sayings, where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">know, focus on user experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">and the money will follow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="170">And that's exactly what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">in-app represents. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="172">Now, in-app is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">for everyone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="173">And we've got very successful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">subscription partners, as well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">as paid app developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="178">But if you're able to inject </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">some omotenashi in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">application, then please </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">do, and give it a try. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="183">And that's the message </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">from this number. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="187">Subscriptions launched about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">12 months ago, as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="190">And since launch, we're very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">excited that the number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">subscribers has doubled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">each quarter. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="196">Now subscriptions have a pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">high hurdle, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">I mean, the user has to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">continuous value, they have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">commit to a recurring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">subscription that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">ordering you in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="204">And so it's got a pretty high </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">hurdle for subscription. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="207">But yet, we're seeing more and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">more users taking that step. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="210">And that's, again, because of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">the applications and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">content you've all been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">created for our users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="215">There's no better example today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">than Pandora, which is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">partner that's now in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">top grossing list. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="220">One of the few non-games that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">completely based on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">subscriptions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="226">Now Android is a global </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">platform clearly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="228">And Google Play store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">is exactly &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">is equally global. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="232">We have buyers in 134 markets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="235">So by pushing that button in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">the Google Play Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">Console, and pushing your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">for sale, you make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">available to buyers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">in 134 countries. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="244">This is unprecedented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">distribution. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="246">Never before has distribution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">been this easy and efficient. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="250">And for you as a developer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">wherever you are in a world &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">whether you're a solo developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">or a multinational </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">corporation &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">we take care of everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">for you. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="259">And we just have to push the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">button, and get your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">application out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="263">Now the countries that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">overlaid on the map are those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">that are &mdash; some of them are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">probably already in your mind. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="269">They're particularly large, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">growing fast. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="271">But there are also other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">countries that we feel like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">are going to play a big part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">of the next 12 months. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="275">And so we're excited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">about that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="277">And we've launched a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">features around localization </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">and translation at I/O, so take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">advantage of that, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">map them up to that set of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">countries &mdash; the 134 &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">and hopefully you'll see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">success globally. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="291">Tablets have been a big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">part of Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="294">over the past 12 months. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="295">And the way the conversation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">generally goes is that we ask </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">you to optimize your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">apps for tablets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="301">And as a business owner, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">look at the costs, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">say, well, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">additional cost. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="306">Is that where I invest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">my resources? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">And I know you have very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">limited resources like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">everyone else. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="311">And the number I want to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">with you today is that a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">tablet monetizes at 1.7x </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">the rate of a phone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="317">So that additional cost of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">optimizing your tablet &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">your application for tablets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">is well worthwhile. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="324">And we want to see more from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">developers doing just that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="327">We've launched a lot of features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">on our end, as well &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">what are the optimization tips </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">for tablets, or the guidelines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">to help you do this, as well. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="335">The other metric that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">interesting is recent platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">releases monetize at 2.2x </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">their prior versions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="343">So what this is telling us is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">again, as you build your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">application, take advantage of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">the latest platform features, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">whether it is Google+ sign-in, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">or all the APIs that launched </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">at I/O this week. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="357">All of that coming together </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">actually has a tangible impact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">on your revenue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="361">It is not just nice to have. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="363">They might be actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">required for you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="365">And you can more than double </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">your revenue by actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">adopting these new features. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="371">Next is, this is a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">intuitive message, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">Higher-rated applications, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">monetize better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="376">But I wanted to give you a sense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">of just how much better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="379">If you go from one to two &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">let's not talk about those. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="382">But if you go from two- to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">three-star, you're actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">almost doubling your revenue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="387">And then again, if you go from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">three to four stars, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">actually almost tripling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">your revenue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="392">So the conversation we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">around quality, and reply to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">reviews, and fixing bugs, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">good customer experience, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">good support &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">all of that has now a tangible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">impact on your revenue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="404">And that's what we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">demonstrate with these metrics. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="407">Finally, as it was mentioned in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">the keynote, over the past </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">year, we've more than doubled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">average revenue per user. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="414">This is even given the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">incredible growth that Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">itself has been having &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">900 million devices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="420">We've actually grown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">ARPU by 2 and 1/2x. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="423">This is the baseline metric </span><span class="line" data-startTime="423">that every platform is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">measured by &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">how profitable are we for you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="429">And this is really exciting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">for us, this particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">development. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="431">And it's a testament, again, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">the type of experiences you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">have been creating, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">how engaging and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">immersing they have been. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="438">So we'll go now into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">product update portion. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="442">And I know it might be obvious, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">or it might be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">intuitive, but I always like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">to start with a baseline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">understanding of our mission. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="449">Everybody &mdash; we've got a bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">people who work on payments </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">who are sprinkled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">around the room. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="453">All of us, we show up to work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">every day because we want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">make our developer successful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="457">And in the context of payments, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">we want to make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">we maximize your income. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="461">So when you work hard and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">build an application &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">an awesome application &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">we want to make sure you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">getting the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">value out of that work. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="468">That's just a baseline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">understanding. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="470">That's why we show up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">to work every day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="472">And a lot of us, that's our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">goal and objective. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="476">So with that in mind, again, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">like to think of things in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">terms of frameworks that just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">simplify the conversation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="481">In this case, I picked a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">simple framework. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="484">We try to maximize your income, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">which means we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">going to increase your sales </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">and reduce your costs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="489">So our conversation going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">forward is going to be around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">in this context &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">how are we maximizing your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">sales, and how are we reducing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">your costs in order to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">maximize your income? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">We've also talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">to you about, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">what drives your sales. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="503">And you told us a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">bunch of things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="505">One is the number of devices out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="505">there &mdash; how many tablets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="507">do we have. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="508">The other thing was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">how many markets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">you're targeting, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">So if we're growing really fast </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">in a particular region </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">but you're actually not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">localizing to it or tailoring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">the experience to it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">you're not really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">benefiting from that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="520">The other aspect is the quality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">of your application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="522">We just saw, if you go from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">three to four, you're tripling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">your revenue. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="526">Your aspect is, how many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">buyers do we have? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">How many credit cards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">do we have on file? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">How many carrier billing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">accounts do we have? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">And then the purchase </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">experience &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">how smooth is it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">How well does it convert? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">This all impacts your sales. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="539">And finally, all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">these things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">happen after the fact. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="542">What if there's cancellations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">because of a poor user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">experience? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">The user did not get the item </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">they purchased, and then they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">call, and that becomes a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">poor user experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="550">So all of these things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">drive your sales. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="552">Now in terms of cost, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">you've told us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">about three big buckets. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="555">These are things we've talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">about in terms of tablets and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">optimizing for them, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">or adopting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">new platform features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="560">It's engineering work, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">You've got to have engineers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">and you've got to have QA, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">you've got to have back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">office and accounting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="567">You've got your acquisition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">costs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="569">Right, so marketing, paid </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">installs, whatever it is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="572">And then you have your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">support costs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="574">So these are the three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">buckets that your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">costs largely fit into. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="579">So with that in mind, I want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="579">show with you some things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">we did to help in each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">of those areas. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="585">So more forms of payment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="586">This clearly comes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="586">up all the time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="588">What have we done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">over the past 12 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">months to address that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">First off is a Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">Play gift card. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="593">It actually only launched </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">in July of last year. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="597">And since then, it's &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">woo, that's right. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="599"><span class="speakerName">Bob Meese</span>: Right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">Somebody's happy. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="602"><span class="speakerName">Ibrahim Elbouchikhi</span>: It only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">launched in July of last year. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="604">And since then, it's become </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">incredibly successful for us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="606">And it's omnipresent in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="606">US retail locations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="610">It's in the UK now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="611">You will see us continue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">to invest in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="613">Google Play gift card. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="615">The whole prepaid form of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="615">payment is critical to us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="618">The other aspect is we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">launch campaigns. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="620">And what campaigns are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">essentially &mdash; in this case, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">you bought a Galaxy S III, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">get a free Galaxy S III &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">which is awesome &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">but also you got $50 to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">spend on Google Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="630">And what this does is, one, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">injects money that gets spent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">on your applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="634">And two, it lowers a hurdle for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="634">users to go from a free </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">app buyer &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">consumer &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">to actually a purchaser. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="641">And our experiments have shown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">that when a user makes one, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">two, three purchases, they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">much more likely to make their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">fourth and fifth even when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">their credit is over. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="652">Finally, carrier billing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="653">And the exciting number I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">to share with you today is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">that 50% of Google Play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">thirty-day actives are now on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">carrier support carrier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">billing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="662">And what that means is that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">are one button-click away </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">from becoming buyers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="667">They don't have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="667">type numbers, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">no expiration dates. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="670">You just have to enable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">it, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="672">they can start buying. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="673">And this is a really critical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">number for us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="675">And as a background, if you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">not aware of what carrier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">billing is, it's essentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">the ability to put your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">purchases on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">monthly bill. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="683">And this is something that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">unique to Google Play, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="685">that we've invested a lot in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="685">the technology behind it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="689">So the other thing you said </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">is the purchase flow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="691">We've heard a lot about our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="691">purchase flow in the past. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="694">I don't know if you've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">through the new store, as well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">as the new purchase flow, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">that's a really exciting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">development for us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="699">And a lot of the design came in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">from feedback you gave us, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">which was that you want the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">purchase flow to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">contextual. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="705">You want it to be fast, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">you want it to be simple. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="709">So we did just that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="710">And in addition to that, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">made it a lot faster. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="713">So in this particular client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">release that came out a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">weeks ago, we've seen a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">35% drop in latency. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="720">In addition to that, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="720">seeing really good user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">feedback, and we're seeing a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">pickup in conversion, as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="729">Now let's shift gears </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">to costs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="731">We've heard a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="731">from you around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">accounting and back office. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="734">And if you're a small developer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">you might not worry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">too much about this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="737">But for our large partners, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="737">there's a big problem. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="740">You couldn't get your reports </span><span class="line" data-startTime="740">on a timely basis. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="742">You couldn't get them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">programatically out of our database. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="745">And so, we've done just that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="747">So with the rollout of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">Google Wallet Merchant Center </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">now &mdash; which is, if you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">have it, you should get it in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">a few weeks &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">you'll be able to use a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">simple script to download all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">your monthly reports, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">injects them into your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="758">backend, and do whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="758">you want with them &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">most likely reconcile. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="763">The other aspect is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">support costs. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="765">And the thing about support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">costs is that if you look at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">the top level cost of lost </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">purchases, you might feel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">that, well, it's bad, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">it's not terrible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="774">But the impact of support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="774">goes well beyond that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="777">One is there is the cost of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">lost sale, and there's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">fixed cost of supporting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">that call, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="783">So if somebody calls 10 minutes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="783">to support that user, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">that's a lot of money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="787">But the worst part is you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">acquired that buyer with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">certain lifetime value </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">assumption, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">And what this does to it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">it truncates its lifetime. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="797">It cuts it short. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="798">And so your math &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">as you're looking at, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">this going to make it &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="802">does this add up for me, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="802">really gets messed up. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="805">And so support, as little as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">you might not pay a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="809">attention to it, is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="809">critical to your revenue and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">sales &mdash; to your costs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">and sales. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="814">And what's the exciting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="814">metric here is IAB v3. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="817">IAB v3 launched in December. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="820">And since then, Gamevil has seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">a 90% drop in customer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="824">contact rates for games where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="824">they have implemented IAB v3. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="829">So there was a talk on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="829">Wednesday about it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="831">Please go watch it on YouTube. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="834">And thank that person over there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="834">for designing IAB v3. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="839">So anyways. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="840">Basically, this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">really awesome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="842">You just need to do it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="844">So in-app order status </span><span class="line" data-startTime="844">API &mdash; this is another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="846">big ask from you &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">which is essentially the ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">for you to take that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="850">purchase token that we send you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="850">back, and turn around and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">verify the status of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">that purchase. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="855">This is for two reasons. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="856">You could do it for either very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">fine authenticity of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="859">purchase, or just the state. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="862">And we're launching this in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">a few weeks worldwide. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="866">So all of our developers will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">have access to this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="868">And it should help a lot with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">reconciling your purchases, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">and even preventing fraud. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1100"><span class="speakerName">Bob Meese</span>: All right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1101">Thanks, Brahim. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1101">And hello, everyone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1103">So to get the growth rates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">that we're seeing, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">clearly doing a lot to help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">support that growth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1109">But much of the work is also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1109">being done by our developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1111">And so this section of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">presentation will really focus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">on the work of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">great developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1116">And we're focusing specifically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1116">on the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">commercially successful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1120">And by commercially successful, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">I mean the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">developers that are not just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">building great products that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1124">their users love, that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1124">being installed in large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">numbers in many cases, but these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">are the developers that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">are making money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">on Google Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1131">And I'll focus on two key </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">parts in this section. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">So one will just be to help you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">understand more about what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1138">these developers are doing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1139">And then I'd also really like to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">focus on how you can apply </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">some of these lessons to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">your own businesses. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1147">So as Brahim said, we've seen a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">7x increase in the last year </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1151">in in-app revenue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1153">Signs of in-app revenue growth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1153">are all over the Play Store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1156">If you look at the top grossing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">apps right now, all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1159">of the top grossing apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1159">are free to play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1162">But with every rule there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1162">always an exception. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1164">And so we have a fun give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1164">we like to play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1165">called Where's Minecraft. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1168">And so there it is, down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1168">there at number 22. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1170">And so we are not saying you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">need to push everything for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1173">free to play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1174">Minecraft is an amazing game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1177">It's an iconic brand with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1177">a very loyal following. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1179">We think it'll continue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1179">to be successful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1182">So we are not asking you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1182">follow the crowd to do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1184">However, also recognize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">the dominant trend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">towards free to play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1189">It's very important to recognize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">that the bar for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">success for a paid title </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">in the top grossing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1194">charts is very high. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1198">More than anything, the trend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1198">that we see is developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1202">allowing users to defer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1202">that payment decision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1205">We see a three-step funnel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">to monetization. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1209">So the first step is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1209">around acquisition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1212">And so this is about expanding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1212">this top of the funnel as wide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1215">as you possibly can, getting as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1215">many users you can to press </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1218">that install button. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1220">The install counts on Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1220">Play are public within a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1222">certain band. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1223">And just go check out some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1223">your favorite paid apps and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">free apps, and check out the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">large, large difference in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">large number of free installs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">that happen on Google Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1233">Second, retention &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">we think this is really an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">under-appreciated part of the funnel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1238">It's part of the omotenashi </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1238">that Brahim </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">was mentioning earlier. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1241">It's an area where our smartest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">developers are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1242">spending more and more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1242">of their time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1245">And the thing we need to focus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">on here is really on earning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">the ability to ask those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">users for money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1251">It's not something that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1251">can take for granted. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1252">For example, if I asked all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1252">you to rate my talk a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">minutes to it right now, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">might ask for a little more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1257">time to see like, hey, what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1257">this guy actually going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">talk about, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">And the same sort of principle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">applies here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1262">So have your users get into your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">product, provide value to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1266">them, have them coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1266">back over time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1268">And clearly, we've seen signs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">that users are more likely to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">pay after they've had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">an experience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">On the topic of monetization, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">we have found that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1429">merchandising really matters. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1431">I think this monkey's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">great here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1432">He's pointing out this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1432">"arr-some" deal, if you can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1434">see the little text there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1436">But 24 gold for $2.99 &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1439">who can beat that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1440">You see below you can go to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1440">full store, but why not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1442">pull out one of the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1442">attractive offers, and put it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1445">right there and make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1445">easy for users to buy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1449">And so, as you saw with Kiwi, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">acquisition is about improving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">your Play Store page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1455">Retention is about rewarding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1455">the user behaviors that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">want to promote, and about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">reinventing the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1459">experience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1460">And monetization and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1460">merchandising matters. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1463">But it's not just enough to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">go linearly through this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1466">What we're seeing the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1466">successful developers on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1468">Google Play do is they create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1468">a virtuous cycle by feeding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1471">back the acquisition several </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1471">different ways. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1475">So those developers that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">able to find success and make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1477">money on Google Play can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1477">reinvest those earnings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1481">through paid user acquisition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1481">to fuel future </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">growth of their products. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1487">Similarly, those developers that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1487">have a great number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1489">retained users can cross-promote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1489">those users &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1492">especially the developers that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1492">have multiple titles &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1494">back into acquisition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1497">Then finally, those developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1497">that are fortunate enough to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1499">reach the top list. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1500">That becomes a self-fulfilling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1500">cycle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1502">You need a lot of installs to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1502">get there, but you get a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1505">of installs from being there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1508">And now I'll talk about some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1508">of these concepts with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1509">other case studies. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">The second one we'll introduce </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">today's DeNA, and the game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">we'll mostly focus on is their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">successful game, "Blood </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1516">Brothers." They have a couple of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1516">other hit titles, including </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">"Marvel War of Heroes," and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">"Rage of Bahamut," which was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1523">clear breakout hit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1523">through 2012. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1526">DeNA also has six other games </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1526">in the top 100 top grossing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1531">So because they have so many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1531">successful titles, they really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">focus on cross-promotion. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1535">In this case, I was playing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1535">"Blood Brothers" on the left. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1538">While I was playing, I received </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1538">this promotion &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1540">"Play Marvel, and receive 50 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1540">MobaCoin." It's a way for them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1543">to target a very attractive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1543">user base &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1547">the user's who are playing their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1547">existing games, and use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1549">them to acquire them for the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1549">games they're launching. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1554">It's also important for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1554">attention to provide very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1557">clear objectives. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1558">The essential objective in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1558">game, "Blood Brothers," is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1560">card collection mechanic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1561">It's all around strengthening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1561">your characters, which they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">call Familiars. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1566">All of the core game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1566">loops in the game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1568">support this core objective. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1570">It's a very powerful thing. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1571">They focus you on a single core </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1571">objective, and then you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">have a game loop of adventuring, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">battling, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1576">leveling up your characters &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">all feeling back into that one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">objective of strengthening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1580">your characters. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1582">Even as you add more complexity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1582">to the game, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1584">you battle and you win, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1584">capture a character. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1587">There's a variety of ways you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1587">can combine these characters </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1589">all back towards that central </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1589">objective of strengthening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1592">your characters. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">And one thing that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">particularly worth calling out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1596">is DeNA's success with events. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1599">So events are variations on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">the standard gameplay that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1602">happen for a very limited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1602">amount of time &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">a fixed duration &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">that provide important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">rewards. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1607">And in this case, they provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1607">rare characters, which are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">extremely valuable within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">the context of the game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1612">Again, feeding back to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1612">strengthening your characters. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1615">But the importance here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1615">creating that sense of urgency </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">through having a limited time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">window and providing something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">that is very valuable. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1624">And that combination </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1624">is very powerful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1628">And you say, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1628">powerful is it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">The monetization in that game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">actually doubles on an average </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1636">revenue-per-user basis </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1636">during these events. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1638">So there's a clear payoff to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1638">finding the ways to make your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">game work for users, to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">that sense of urgency, to give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1645">the players that great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1645">experience, to provide a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">slightly different gaming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">experience, to give them a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">different way to interact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">with other users. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1651">And clearly, there's a financial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1651">reward for doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">this within the game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1658">The next one I'll talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">is Kabam, another very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">successful developer that has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">moved just last year from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">web over to mobile. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1666">So in Kabam's case, we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">to focus their case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">study on "Kingdoms of Camelot: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">Battle for the North." They </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">also have several other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">successful titles on Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">Play, including "The Hobbit," </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">"Arcane Empires," and the soon </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1677">to be released "Fast </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1677">and Furious 6." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1681">One of the lessons from Kabam </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1681">was always be testing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1685">Kabam focuses on core </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">gaming users. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">Core gaming users monetize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">much better than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">your average user. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1691">And as a result of being able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1691">earn that revenue, they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">able to reinvest those earnings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">back into paid user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1697">acquisition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1698">In this case here, they're doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1698">a split-test on several </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">different campaigns. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1702">On the campaign on the left, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1702">can see a campaign focused </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">around characters and concept. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1708">On the campaign on the right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">you can see a campaign much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">more focused around a realistic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1711">depiction of gameplay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1713">Kabam is always testing, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1713">so based on the relative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1715">success of each of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1715">campaigns, they can add more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1718">resources to one, take them away </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1718">from another, and be very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1721">flexible in growing their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1721">overall user base. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1726">In terms of retention, as I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">mentioned, Kabam recently came </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1729">from web over to mobile, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1729">they quickly realized the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">difference in those users. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">And what was that change? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">So the thing that changed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">in February is Pandora </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">implemented our in-app billing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">subscriptions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1828">Previously before that time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">while the revenue was in, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">payments were much flatter, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">had to go actually from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1833">your mobile device over to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1833">Pandora on the web and sign up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1836">for a subscription there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1836">to be able to use the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1838">subscriptions on mobile. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1840">By reducing all that payment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1840">friction, by allowing the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">to purchase directly from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">mobile device, they saw a big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">bump in overall payments. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1847">But it doesn't stop there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1850">It gets even better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">the next month. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1852">Because what happened here? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1854">So at this time, Pandora still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1854">allowed users 40 free hours of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1859">mobile listening per month. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1861">But for those users who reached </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">those 40 free hours </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1864">and still wanted more, Pandora </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1864">asked them to pay. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1867">And that's what really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1867">allows this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1869">And omotenashi is the theme. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1871">It's funny, that mix of &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1872">you have users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1873">You're providing a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1873">value to users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1875">For free, you're providing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1875">40 free hours of mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1878">listening per month. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1880">But yet there's so many users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1880">who want to help you build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1883">your business. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1884">They love the product so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1884">much that they're happy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1887">to pay at that time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1891">So in summary, when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1891">thinking about acquisition, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">think about improving your Play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">Store page, and investing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1897">in your Play Store page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1899">Consider cross-promotion, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">especially with multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">different applications. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2004"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: I have one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2004">quick question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2006">Can I ask now? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">[APPLAUSE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2015">You said something about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2015">carrier billing apart </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2017">from the gift card. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">What is the carrier billing? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2020"><span class="speakerName">Ibrahim Elbouchikhi</span>: So carrier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2020">billing is basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2022">the ability for the user to put </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2022">their purchases on their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">monthly bill. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">So the same bill you get from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">your provider, you would just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2030">put all your purchases </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2030">on that bill. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2031">And so, it just adds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2031">up to that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2033"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Oh, so you're ordering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2033">international calling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">or something, is it used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">for that, or what? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2037"><span class="speakerName">Ibrahim Elbouchikhi</span>: It's just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2037">for buying in-app products. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2039">So when you're, let's say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2039">playing a game, or you're even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">subscribing to Pandora, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">can put your Pandora </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2043">subscription on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2043">monthly phone bill. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2046"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Oh, that bill. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2049"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Hello. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2050">I'm having a little bit of time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2050">just judging business </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2053">models, and evaluating business </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2053">models when I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">thinking about developing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">apps. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2057">Like for example, you're talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2057">about 7x improvements, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2060">5x improvements, 2x </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2060">improvements, and all that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2062">sounds great but 0 times </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2062">5 is still 0. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2064">So the question is, what does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2064">it mean to be in the hundred </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2067">top grossing apps? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">Is there any charts of like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">revenue, actual dollars per </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2072">month, if you are a certain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2072">percentile of your app in that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">top grossing list? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2078">I'm having a really hard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2078">time finding useful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2079">data in that direction. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2082"><span class="speakerName">Ibrahim Elbouchikhi</span>: So I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">say that's probably like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">partner data. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2085">Like we generally can't share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2085">information like that about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">how much revenue our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">people make in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">our different rankings. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2091">It varies a lot depending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2091">on what type of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2094">application is up there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2095">Clearly, if you're &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">if you have a $9.99 a month </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">subscription, and you're on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2099">the top grossing, that gets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2099">you up there faster. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">And it just &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2103">it varies a lot, so it's kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2103">hard for us to give a firm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">number there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2106"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Even if it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">completely anonymous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2108">statistics, like if your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2108">is in the top 2%, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2111">expect, I don't know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2111">$3,000 a month? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2115"><span class="speakerName">Bob Meese</span>: You want more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2115">of just what is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">the data behind it? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2117"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Yeah, just very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2117">rough guidelines. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2120">Can I expect to make $30 a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2120">month? $3,000 a month? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2123">$300,000 a month, if I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2123">have a top 2% app? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">It's just really hard to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">get a feeling for this. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2128"><span class="speakerName">Bob Meese</span>: Sure. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2128">I mean if you're interested </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2128">enough, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">data that's out there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2131">A number of the developers are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2131">publicly traded, and so there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">you can get a sense of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">their revenues are. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">As Brahim said, it's challenging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">for us to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2138">our partners' data. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2139">We all have confidentiality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2139">agreements. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">We've tried as much as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">possible through this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2143">presentation to be as open, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2143">over time we become more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2146">and more open. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">But if you want to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">more, we can find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">you at Office Hours. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2149"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: OK, thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2151"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Hey. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">Now with the version three of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">that in-app billing, how soon </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2155">can we expect to be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2155">to do multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">purchases of a single item? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2160">For instance, purchase 200 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2160">tokens for $200, and have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2164">Google Play handle the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2164">maintenance of that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2168"><span class="speakerName">Ibrahim Elbouchikhi</span>: So that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2168">versus configuring one SKU </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">that equals 200 tokens? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2175">It's not on the immediate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2175">roadmap, but it's something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">we've talked about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">in the past. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2179">So I'll take that back to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2179">team, and see if we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">prioritize it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2183">And the use case, is it just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2183">a maintenance issue, or &mdash; ? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2186"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Well, I mean, I can do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2186">it right now, but I'll have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">to build my own server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">infrastructure to manage the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2191">consumption of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2191">200 tokens. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">So what I'd really like to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">is I'll allow the user to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2195">purchase 200 tokens. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2197">And then as they use them in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2197">game, I just tell Google Play, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2199">you know, consumer on token, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2199">consumer on token. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2203"><span class="speakerName">Ibrahim Elbouchikhi</span>: OK. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2204">Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2204">That makes sense. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2206"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Hi. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2207">Do you have any tip </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2207">on what's better? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2211">Do a [? light ?] in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2211">[? pro app ?], or do a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2214">[? light ?] app with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2214">an in-app purchase? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2218">IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2218">I'm sorry. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">I didn't get that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2220"><span class="speakerName">Bob Meese</span>: You're saying whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2220">you should do two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">different applications, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">whether you do a free app with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2223">in-app purchase? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">One area we found is whenever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">developers have two different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2227">apps, it creates a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2227">lot of overhead. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2230">So some of the general guidance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">is simplifying &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">finding one application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">to invest all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2235">your resources behind. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2236">Otherwise, it can lead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2236">to confusion. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">So the general best practice is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">to invest in a single app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2240">especially for small </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2240">developers. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2242"><span class="speakerName">Ibrahim Elbouchikhi</span>: And the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2242">upgrade experience is not as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">nice, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">Because you have to get them to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">go install a different app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2246">and buy another app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2246">versus just in-app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2249">purchase and you upgrade. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2250">You unlock new content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2250">immediately in the app. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2255"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2255"><span class="speakerName">Ibrahim Elbouchikhi</span>: Sure. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2257"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Yeah, I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2257">wondering if you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2259">considering doing promo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2259">codes for paid apps? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">And are you also considering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">affiliate programs? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2267"><span class="speakerName">Ibrahim Elbouchikhi</span>: Yeah, those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">are things that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2268">looked into, as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">We've launched the promotional </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">campaigns in terms of promo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2273">codes for money. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2274">So you can actually get $50, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2274">I mentioned, in the earlier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2277">Galaxy S III campaign. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2280">Or we're looking as well into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2280">being able to allow developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2283">to issue promo codes, and have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2283">them redeemed by whatever it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2286">is &mdash; the press, or reviewers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2286">on whoever it is. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">Yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2289"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: And what about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">the affiliate programs? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2292">Are you going to launch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2292">that soon? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2295"><span class="speakerName">Ibrahim Elbouchikhi</span>: I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2295">think it will launch soon. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">But there's differently talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">about them, especially in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2300">content side of Google Play. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2303">But I will definitely take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2303">that back to the team. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2306"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: All right Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2309"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: How are you defining </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2309">what is a top app? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2311">Is it the top sales that day, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2311">that week, that month? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">And are you also doing any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">editorializing around that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">where you're just putting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">in things that you like? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2320"><span class="speakerName">Bob Meese</span>: No, no. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2321">All of the top list are straight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2321">algorithmic in there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2324">It's revenue transacted through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2324">Google Play, and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2328">generally over a week </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2328">time frame. </span></p>
