<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="189"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Hey, everybody, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">welcome to another great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">Behind the Divs. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">Today, we're going to be talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">with the team behind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">the new Chrome experiment, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">Roll It. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">So with that, I want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">introduce you guys to two of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">the engineers. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">Sean, why don't you go ahead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">and introduce yourself? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="206"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: Hey, everybody. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">My name is Sean Klassen. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">I am one of the founders of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">company called Legwork, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">we're based out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">Denver, Colorado. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">And the Google Creative Lab </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">came to us to help them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">realize this new experiment. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">They wanted to show off some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">technology with WebSockets and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">syncing your mobile device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">with your computer. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="231"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">And Justin, do you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">to introduce yourself? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="235"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: Absolutely. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">I'm Justin Gitlin, also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">in Denver, Colorado. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">I'm one of the co-founders and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">partners in a development shop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">called Mode Set. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">And we've worked with Sean at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">Legwork before, and we all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">used to work at a company </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">together back in the day. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">So I've got a great relationship </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">with them, and, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">yeah, so we did most of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">front end development. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="256"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">So actually, that's a good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">question to start off with. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">You guys are sort of two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">different agencies. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">How did you split the work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">between the two of you guys? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="268"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: Yeah, I guess </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">originally, the Creative Lab </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">came to us, and they were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">like, hey, we have been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">prototyping with this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">new technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="278">We want to make a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">game with it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="280">What do you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">have for ideas? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="282">And we came up with a bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="282">of different things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="286">I remember at one time, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">were talking about making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">almost like a "Guitar Hero" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">type of thing, where you'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">rock out against someone and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">eventually settled on where we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">did with this game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="300">And we brought in Justin &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="304">like he was saying, we've worked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="304">together on a bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">projects, and he's awesome at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">mobile development and just a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">great developer in general. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="313">And he helped us make this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">thing a reality. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="317">It is really a pretty agile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">environment We had some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">initial features and user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">stories set up and then just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">kind of kept iterating on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">design and the dev really all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">the way 'til the end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">and the launch, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">we run out of time. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="335"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">often how it works. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">It's sort of like really crazy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">right up until the end, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">then once you hit the end, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">you're like, this is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">really good. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">We're really impressed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">with this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">So &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="346"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: Yeah, and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">always nerve-racking, too, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">because you've been so buried in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">it, you don't know how it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">going to be received. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="353"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah, absolutely. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">And I want to mention to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">folks who are watching live </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">right now that if you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">questions that you want to ask </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">of either Justin or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">Sean, you can post </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">those to Google Moderator. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">The link is there on screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">somewhere that way I think. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">But you can post those there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">We'll be taking those as we go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">throughout our Hangout today. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">But I want to ask you a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">bit about the workflow because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">working between two agencies and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">the Google Creative Labs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">team must've been kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">of interesting. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">And I know that at Google I/O </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">this year, one of the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">popular sessions from the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">side was about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">modern mobile workflow. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">What did your mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">workflow look like? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="398"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: So the workflow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">from my end, from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">development side on the front </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">end, was writing all of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">code in a Ruby on Rails </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">environment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="411">And with that, you get all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">benefits of the Rails asset </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">pipeline, which concatenates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">all your files, compresses </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">them, transcompiles any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">CoffeeScript or Sass, Haml, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="428">using Sprockets and whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="428">other machineries in the asset </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">pipeline to make that really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">seamless process. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="437">So I've mentioned that almost </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">all of the custom code for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">this game was written </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">in CoffeeScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="443">And we found that to be &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">we ended up with less code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">cleaner code than writing pure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="451">So that's something that we at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">Mode Set generally will write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">99% of the time. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="457">It depends. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="458">If we're writing something under </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">500 lines of code, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">that's the entire project, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">or a quick prototype or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">something, we might just write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">some raw JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="466">But we've really come to love </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">the things that you gain out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">of CoffeeScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="472">Especially for this project, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">which was quite a bit of code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">many thousands of lines of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">custom code on top the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">third-party product libraries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">that we used and built in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">really object-oriented way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="485">We found that it really helps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">you organize and end up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">much cleaner and less code at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">the end of the project. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="492"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Huh. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">That's interesting. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">One of the questions actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">on our Moderator queue is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">about why you chose </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">CoffeeScript, which you kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">of addressed. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">But is it something you'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">recommend other folks use? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="506"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: Definitely. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">So obviously, you have to &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">they call it transcompiling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">CoffeeScript to JavaScript. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">So there is one step before your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">CoffeeScript is ready to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">be interpreted by the browser. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">And in our environment, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">Ruby on Rails environment, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">it's really easy to set that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">up and make it completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">transparent. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">If you don't have a Ruby on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">Rails environment or something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">like that that's going to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">it automatically for you as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">you're writing and refreshing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">the page and hitting your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">server, I've found that a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">of people are using a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">front-end compilation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">tool called Grunt. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">That seems to be a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">popular one, and I've started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">playing with that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">And it's really nice. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">So I'd say if you're not using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">any sort of server, backing up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">your code, Grunt's a great way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">to go to compile and do all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">the same things pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">seamlessly as well. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="566"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: We've used that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">on some other projects here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">ourselves when we don't want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">build any kind of back-end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">system or don't have access to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">do that for whatever reason. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="575"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="575"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: Because not every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="575">project is going to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">a back end. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">We've had projects where we just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">upload a bunch of files </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">to an Apache server, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">and that's it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">So I think in that case, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">something like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">Grunt's a great option. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">In our case, we did end up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">compiling the entire site down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">to static files, and we used the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">Ruby on Rails helpers to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">do that for us. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">So we just wrote a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">of Ruby to take our dynamic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">assets and translate those into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">a static file system. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="609"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: OK. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">So what other tools were you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">using for your build process? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="616"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: Like on a higher </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">level, because Google Creative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">Labs is in New York, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">both in Denver. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">So we needed just some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">communication tools that were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">pretty important. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">We used Google Hangouts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">almost every day. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">And then we used Pivotal Tracker </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">to track all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">features that we were working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">on and prioritize them. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">And that was probably one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">the biggest, most important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">tools for us. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="646"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yep. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">And were you using that for bug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">tracking, or what were you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">using that for? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="654"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: We used it for bug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="654">tracking, and then we also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">used it just to know what was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">next in our to-do list, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">there's revisions, or how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">difficult things we were going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">to be, like if we were going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">to hit our milestones. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">And we put design items right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">along with [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="672">development items. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="673"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: OK. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">All the design tasks were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">in there as well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">Cool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="677"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: It's a good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="677">way to sort of have some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">conversation going back and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">forth about bugs or features, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">creating new user stories if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">somebody has a brand new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">feature they want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">add into the app. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">It's something that we'd track </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">all that right there and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="691">prioritize by sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="691">ordering the list </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">of stories in Tracker. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">So it's just a nice project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">management tool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="699"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: And that's Pivotal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">Tracker, you said? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="701"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: Yep. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="702"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: All right, cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">So let's take one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">questions from the folks who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">are watching live. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">And Manuel wants to know, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">is it possible to send the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="711">data from the gyroscope so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="711">fast through the web, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">including all the coding and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">encoding that makes such a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">game possible? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="719"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: So the key </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">technology there is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="722">WebSockets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="723">So if you're not familiar with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">WebSockets, it's a lower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="727">level, faster protocol. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="729">Rather than using HTTP requests, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">it creates more of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">direct connection between your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">machine, a server, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">another machine &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="737">or any number of machines. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="738">But in our case, for Roll It, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">was your mobile device and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">your laptop. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="744">And all those messages are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">going through a server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">somewhere else, which I think a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">lot of people are surprised </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">at how quickly you can get those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">messages transmitting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="752">We were sending about 15 to 20 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">messages a second during </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">certain parts of the game, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">specifically during gameplay </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">for some of the ambient elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">to have a little tilt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">based on the accelerometer data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">coming in, as well as on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">the menu screens, the entire </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">menu sort of tilts back and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">forth, and you get a little ball </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">rolling across the screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">to show what your menu </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">selection is. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="777">And in our case, we're only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">sending a really small amount </span><span class="line" data-startTime="780">of data for that, pretty much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="780">just the tilt angle. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="785"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">So that effectively, in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">document, or in the case study </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">that you guys wrote, it looks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">like that's only maybe 50 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="794">bytes or so to send the tilt. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">Is that right? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="797"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: Yeah, Something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">really tiny like that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">It's a really small JSON object </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">that gets transmitted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="802">over WebSockets and picked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="802">up on the other device. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">So yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">I mean, obviously, the smaller </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">you can keep that data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">transmitting, the quicker </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">it's going to go. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">And the chance of losing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">messages along the way due to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="814">latency would be decreased. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">So obviously, in our case, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">you want to make that as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">small as you can. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="822"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: I think that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">something that we tested a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">up front, even before we got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">into the interface design </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">stuff, because we didn't want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">to set up situations &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">or at least wanted to minimize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">the situations &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">where there would be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">that lag time. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="836">And we wanted to know how far </span><span class="line" data-startTime="836">we could push that with it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">still feeling like a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">nice experience. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="842"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah, cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="844">Well, why don't we take another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="844">one of the questions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="846">from there? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="850">Are there going to be more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="850">practical uses for this modern </span><span class="line" data-startTime="854">technique, do you think? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="859">I would think so. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="859">I mean, Google Creative Labs is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="859">awesome at coming up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">new ways to push the technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">that's coming out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">in Chrome and just on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">the web in general. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="871">And hopefully, if we all did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">our jobs right, this will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">inspire lots of people to come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">up with new, practical ways to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="880">use this technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="882">The game's obviously really fun, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">especially it was for us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">to work on. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="885">But I think there's a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">that could be done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">with this for sure. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="891"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: Gaming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">is a great example. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">But yeah, I think there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">plenty of opportunities to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">create new gestures and create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">new interactions with the web. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">And it's up to us to come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">up with those, right? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="905"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah, and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">one of the cool things about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="906">Chrome Experiments is they are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="906">designed to make it really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">easy to show developers what is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">possible and what's sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">available on the web. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">I'm kind of curious about one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">of the comments in the case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="920">study that you guys wrote. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">And you talked about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">development tools becoming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">more mature for the web. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="926">And you talked about just some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="926">of them that you use, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="929">CINEMA 4D and Blender. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">What we're some of the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">tools that you liked, and what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="934">was the part of the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="934">Developer Tools that you found </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">most useful? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="942"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: I can speak </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">to some of the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">applications. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="945">We still used Photoshop to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="945">the interface stuff, which I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">know some people think is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">old school, probably. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">But it still is the best </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">method for us. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">And then I think all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">developers these days are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="958">using Sublime Text to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="958">edit their code in. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">And then when you get into like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">the console and stuff in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="967">Chrome, that's obviously </span><span class="line" data-startTime="967">critical. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">Justin probably can speak better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">to that than I can. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="973"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: Yeah, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="973">the biggest tool in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="979">developer tools inside of Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="979">was the timeline with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">watching memory usage, just to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">make sure that our memory heap </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">didn't keep growing beyond </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">a reasonable boundary. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="989">So that helped just kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">of track down memory </span><span class="line" data-startTime="992">leaks along the way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="995">I think when you're running at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="995">60 frames a second inside of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">video game environment, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">have to be really careful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">about instantiating new objects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">and rather reusing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">objects whenever possible and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">resetting values rather than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1008">creating new objects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1008">along the way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1011">So I think the memory </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">usage tool is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1014">helpful with that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1016">Obviously, the Network panel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1016">will show you any requests </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">coming down, so that was helpful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">in kind of reducing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">the overall number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">of requests. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1025">So one thing that we did to sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1025">of minimize the amount of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1029">requests was Base64 encoding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1029">everything that we possibly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1032">could that was a reasonable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1032">size to Base64 encode. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1036">So any image under around 10 K </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1036">in size, we'd Base64 encode </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">and put that directly into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">CSS or inline in the HTML as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1048">an image source attribute. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1051">As well you can use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1051">Base64-encoded images as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1056">three.js textures. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1057">So three.js was the 3D library </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">that we used to create the 3D </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">environment. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1062">As well, we Base64 encoded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1062">the fonts. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1065">So pretty much anything that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1065">was going to be an external </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1068">request that was small enough, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1068">we encoded to be inline with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">the CSS or the JavaScript. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1074"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Now I remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1074">reading in the case study that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">you said in particular with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">Base64 encoding the fonts, did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1080">you Base64 encode both the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1080">different types of fonts? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1084">And if so, do all browsers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1084">download both of those? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1089">Or do you do some smarts to say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1089">oh, this browser supports </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1092">this, so I'm going to send only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1092">this type, this browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1095">supports this, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1095">that you reduce </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">the size of the download? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1098"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: Yeah, all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1098">the modern browsers should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">download them fine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">at this point. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1104">And we did have to do a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1104">little rearranging. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1108">I found one little bug in which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1108">case a certain browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">needed the SVG font listed in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">front of the WAF font to draw </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">into the canvas context </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">correctly. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1119">But generally, we used an SVG </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1119">font and a WAF font, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">seemed to be enough to cover </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">all the modern browsers. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1128"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">Well, why don't we take another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">question from our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">Moderator queue? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">And again, the link if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">want to submit your own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">questions is there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">on the page. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1138">But did you have any challenges </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1138">syncing the devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">in the screens? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">And this is from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">Fred in London. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1146"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: I think the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1146">Google team had that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">theoretically working when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">they came to us. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">And there was a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">bit of a challenge. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">But that was not one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">the harder parts of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">development at all. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1161"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: And that system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">was built not by us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1166">It was the development team that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1166">also built the back end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">for the Racer experiment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">and the Jam with Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1173">experiment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1174">And they've sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">gotten down to a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1175">science at this point. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1177">And that all works over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1177">WebSockets once the connection </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1182">is established. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1183">But there is a bit of up front </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1183">process that has to happen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">between the two devices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1189">So there's the code that you get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">when you start a game that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1193">you use to connect the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1193">two devices together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1196">And there's a bit of back-end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1196">work that goes into generating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1199">that code, the desktop telling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1199">the back end, OK, we're using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1204">this code, so give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1204">me a server. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1207">And once you get that server, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1207">that's sort of stored on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1210">back end to create the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1210">WebSocket connection. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1213">And then on the mobile end, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">enter your code, and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">back end recognizes that code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">sends you back that server, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1220">and that's how both devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1220">end up with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1225">same WebSocket server. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1227">So that upfront process, there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1227">was certainly a bit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">back-end work that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">went into it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1232">But implementing it from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">front end was pretty easy with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1234">the API that they had set up. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1236"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Oh nice, nice. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">So it was just simply an API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">library that you could call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">into and just be like, hey, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">want to go do this, and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1242">just worked relatively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1242">easily for you? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1245"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: Because the back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">end developers were great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1247">at what they did, definitely. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">And that's all built with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">Go language on Google's App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">Engine and Compute Engine. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">There's a whole series of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">technologies that will create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1260">like a private WebSocket server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1260">for the two machines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">per game and does a lot load </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">balancing up front. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1266">And one interesting piece of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1266">that equation was that on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">front end, we would receive a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">list of up to three different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1275">WebSocket servers, and we would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1275">ping each one to try to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1278">find the closest and fastest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1278">WebSocket server to the user. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1280">So there was some optimization </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1280">there to make for the quickest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1285">experience on the front end. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1287"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">So actually, that leads into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">another interesting and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1291">think pretty important question </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1291">for mobile and just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1296">for the web today in general. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1297">And that's like, perf </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1297">matters, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">Like, performance is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">really important. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1302">How did you guys think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1302">performance throughout the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1308">entire building of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1308">this experience? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1311"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: I'd say that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1311">really challenging because we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1315">were using some things that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1315">hadn't necessarily developed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">any kind of major projects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">with before. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">And luckily, we didn't have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">support every browser out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1327">there for this because some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1327">the technologies don't work. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">But it was something that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">had a balance with just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">building the actual features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">themselves. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1338">So even close to launch, we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1338">noticed some bugs and stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">that we've fixed, or just ways </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">to improve performance. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1347">But there's always room to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1347">better at that, for sure. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1351"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah, absolutely. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1353"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: And I think some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1353">of the things that I ran </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1355">into that were really big hits </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1355">on performance were in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1360">three.js, the 3D library, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1360">more you have loaded into that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1367">3D environment, the slower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1367">it's going to go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1369">So in the 3D world, the lower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1369">poly you can make your models, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1375">the faster it's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1375">to perform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1376">So having fewer polygons </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1376">in your 3D meshes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1380">So that's something we went back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">and forth a lot between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">the code end and Sean's team, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">who were building the 3-D </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">models for the skee ball lane </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">and any other 3D models that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1390">were in the game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1393">So there was definitely a bit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1393">figuring out through their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1396">tools, like CINEMA 4D and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1396">Blender, on how to reduce the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1399">polygon count before they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1399">exported those models and sent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1402">them over to me to drop into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1402">the three.js scene. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1406">Similarly, the physics library </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1406">that we were using, Physijs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">which is sort of a wrapper </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">around a 3D physics library </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1417">that is really easy to drop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1417">into a three.js scene, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">more walls that you create that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">are physics-enabled, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1425">more collision detection </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1425">has to happen. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">So the less processing per </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">frame in the game that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1432">could execute, the better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1434">So we did some manual sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1434">creation of the physics scene </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1440">that's invisible to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1440">the user but is &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1443">like the 3D models that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1443">see in the game are just a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">facade over some 3D physics </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">objects that were created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1451">manually in JavaScript. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1453"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Now did you guys do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">any dynamic changing of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">amount of processing that's done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">depending on how fast the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1460">user's computer is or what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1460">device they're running from or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">anything like that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1466"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: We started to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1468">So I got into something along </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1468">those lines towards the end of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1473">the project when some older </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1473">machines weren't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">running quite as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1476">But it turns out that some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">the aspects of three.js can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">really be changed on the fly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1485">And that's kind of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1485">I was checking. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1486">Like if you were running at 20 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1486">frames a second versus 60 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1488">frames a second, I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1488">trying to drop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">certain lighting or shadowing. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1493">But it turns out that's pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1493">hard to achieve without sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">of rebuilding the entire scene </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">without those features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1498">And that's due to three.js </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">being really good at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">optimizing lighting and building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">your shaders once and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1506">storing those on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1506">the video card. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1507">And that's why three.js </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1507">runs so quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1509">But it also means that changing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1509">certain things on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">fly is going to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">really tough. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1513"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1513">that makes sense. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1514"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: And WebGL was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">pretty interesting to work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">with, too, because we had to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">try and detect a bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">different stuff. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1524">Like some computers will allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1524">aliasing, some don't. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1530">And there's a software component </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1530">to it to make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1536">work, but there's also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1536">a hardware component. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1538">And we can tell someone to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1538">upgrade their software, but we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1541">can't get them to upgrade </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1541">their hardware. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1544"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1544">a little bit harder. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1545">Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1547">Why don't we take one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1547">next questions in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1549">Moderator queue? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1551">And Manuel, again, wants to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1551">know, why didn't Chrome need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">any special permissions to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">the gyroscope without having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">to root the device or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">anything like that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1567"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: I guess there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1567">are certain things that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1570">clearly sort of violations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1570">of somebody's privacy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1573">If a website's going to access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1573">your camera without asking, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1578">that shouldn't be allowed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1579">I think most people would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">agree with that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1581">And we did work with the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">Creative Lab team to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">make sure that we were not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">sending any sensitive user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1588">data over the connections </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1588">because I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1591">think Google clearly &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1593">with that process that we had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1593">to go through to sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1595">outline every little bit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1595">information we're sending from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1598">machine to machine &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">that there's clearly a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">sensitivity to people's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1602">privacy, which I definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1602">appreciate. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1605">And I think you can't really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">glean anything from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1609">accelerometer about where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1609">someone is or necessarily what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1612">they're doing, or you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1612">can't really be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1614">creepy with that data. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1616"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">Yeah, no, that's very true. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">One of the cool things is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">accelerometer, the device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">motion, device orientation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">stuff, is all part of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1625">standard HTML5 spec. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">So that's available to any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">developer who wants to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1630">for the web. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1632"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: Yeah, and I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">Androids and iPhones, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">pretty much all smartphones </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">allow you access to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1641">within the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1641">now, at least if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1644">the software's current. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1645"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">Actually, that's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">good question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">Did you face any problems in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">dealing with the experiment or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">with anything like that, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">dealing with the device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">orientation in device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">motion stuff? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1661"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: Yeah, there was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1661">definitely challenges. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1663"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: And I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">be right back. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1663"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: I think the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">biggest thing was doing our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1667">best to normalize the data to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1667">one solution that worked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">across everything that supported </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">those objects. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1682">Some phones are better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1682">than others. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">But I think we came up with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">pretty good way to make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1689">work across everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1689">pretty much the same. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1693"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Awesome. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1694"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: Yeah, just to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">follow up on that, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1699">certain phones will have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1699">faster rate at which the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1701">accelerometer updates come in, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1701">or the accelerometer event is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">fired on a window. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1706">So to pick those up at different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1706">intervals, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1709">implemented some time stamping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1709">along with each update to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1714">normalize them across devices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1717">So maybe a device that's running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">slower than another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">device will hopefully feel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">pretty much the same. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">And we definitely went through a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">lot of iterations of how the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1728">swing, like as you swing your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1728">phone to perform the roll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">gesture, we went through a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">of iterations where we would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1735">think it felt good, but then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1735">we'd hand it to somebody else </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1737">to beta test, and they just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1737">wouldn't be able to do it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1741">So there was a lot of sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1741">back and forth on watching how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1744">people picked up a phone and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1744">swung at and adjusting based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">on what we saw. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1749">It's easy as somebody who's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1749">developing something like this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">to get to a point where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">think, oh, this is great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1756">It works. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1757">And then you hand it to someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1757">else, and they just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1758">can't figure it out. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">So there was definitely a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">in terms of making the roll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">gestures feel right. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1765"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1766">So another question, this one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1766">actually comes from Paul </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">Kinlan, one of the guys on my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">team who's based in London. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1772">He wanted to know if there were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1772">any features that don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1777">exist as part of the Open Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1777">Platform that you guys would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1782">have liked to have had, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1782">would've been useful, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1784">would've made building this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1784">experiment easier. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1790"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: I don't know. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">I never even thought about that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">because the job from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1796">start was to think what can we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1796">do with this technology. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1802">But I guess maybe like you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1802">somewhat limited in the speed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1811">of your connections and how fast </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1811">things return from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">gyroscope and accelerometers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">and stuff. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1819">But I don't know. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1821">I think it was pretty good. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1823"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1823"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1824">I guess one thing that I could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1824">think of is given that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1827">game is based so much on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1827">WebSocket protocol, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1832">does require obviously going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1832">out to a remote server and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">then coming back into your house </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">or office or wherever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">you're playing, there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">certain corporate offices or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1843">cell providers that block </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1843">WebSockets connections. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1847">So that was a pretty big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1847">challenge that we ran into, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">and especially testing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">was really tough. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1853">Somebody testing it may have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1853">been in an office that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1855">blocking WebSockets, but we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1855">didn't have access as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1858">developers to get in there and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1858">actually see what type of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">errors were being thrown or how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">that WebSocket connection </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1864">was closing automatically. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1866">So we ran into some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">pretty tough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1868">issues along those lines. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1869">So I think one thing that maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1869">would have been cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1872">would be to not have to hit a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1872">remote server to have your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1875">WebSocket connection </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1875">established, or maybe some way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1878">of syncing two devices and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1878">creating that connection </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">without having to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">hit a server. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1884">That could be cool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1885"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1886">In fact, that is coming. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1888">That's coming as part of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1888">the new WebRTC APIs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1891">And they're going to allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1891">peer to peer connections. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1894">So today by going, you guys have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">to go up to the server to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1897">come back down. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1898">With peer connections, you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1898">have to go up to a server in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">order to do the initial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">handshake and figure out where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">the other user is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1905">But once you've done that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1905">initial handshake, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">connect directly to the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">machine, which means much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1913">faster connections, no longer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1913">needing to deal with that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1917">hey, somebody else might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1917">shut anything down. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1920">Much better option, I think, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1920">and a much better future. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1924"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">I think that the WebRTC stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">is really exciting. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1927">Because you can already see with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1927">our experiment you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">make stuff feel pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">real time. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1932">And so you're going to be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1932">to send so much more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">data back with that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1938"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1939">And you guys have written a case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1939">study that goes into some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1942">more technical depth on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1942">some of the stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">on how you did this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1945">And you've got some great code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1945">examples and that in there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1948">I've put the URL on screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1948">for people to check out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1951">But you can see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1951">case study there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1953">It's on HTML5 Rocks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1957">I think we're down towards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">the end of the questions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1961">Is there anything that you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">want to add or sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">mention before we wrap up? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1970"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: I don't know. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1970">I can't really think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1970">of too much. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">I'm thankful for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">opportunity to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1974">be a part of this. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1975"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Well, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1975">was a great project. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">I think you guys did a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">great job and should be very, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1979">very happy with what you got. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1983"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: I guess one sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1983">of thing that I've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1985">pondering a bit as we've wrapped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1985">it up, I think there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1989">is something about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1989">familiarity of skee ball that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">I think made this really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">successful in the hands of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1995">people that may not be so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1995">tech-savvy and may not be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">quite as hip to what's hot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">and new on the internet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2001">And that's something we've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">talking about, just why </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">do people sort of latch onto </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">it across the internet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2011">And I think it's due to some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">amount of familiarity wrapped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2016">into these sort of cutting-edge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2016">technologies. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">So I think that's a lesson to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">take away just for other sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2021">of experimentation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2023">If you can make something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2023">may be using these new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">technologies that feels so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">cutting edge to us web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2028">developers but make it feel not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2028">so intimidating for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2033">average user to pick up and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2033">start interacting with, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">think there's something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">to be said for that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2037"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: Yeah, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2037">that's a good point. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">You just have to learn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">one new thing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">You don't have to learn two or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">three or whatever new things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2045">So that's a lot less </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2045">intimidating. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2047"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">Well, I have one last question </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">for you guys. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2051">What's your high score? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2054"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: Oh man. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">I got a fireball on the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">turn of the game once. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">So I got like 940 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">or something. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2062"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: All right, 940. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2064">And Justin? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2064"><span class="speakerName">Justin Gitlin</span>: All right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">I guess I've play this game so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">many times that I don't know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">that I have a good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">answer for you. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2071">I will say, though, while we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2071">were at the Google I/O </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">conference, we had a competition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">for how many 100s </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2077">we could get in a game. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2079">And Sean and I both tied </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2079">at two 100s per game. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2083"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: All right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2083">So just two. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">So folks who are watching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">at home, g.co/rollit. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">You've got to beat two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">100s in a row. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2092"><span class="speakerName">Sean Klassen</span>: Oh, just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2092">in the game. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2094"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Just in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2094">game, all right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2097">Well, guys, Sean, Justin, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2097">thank you very much for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2100">joining us today. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">The URL for the documentation is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">there that you can go check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">out and have a look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">at the case study </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2109">that these guys wrote. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2110">And thanks for joining us. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">We're going to be back next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">week with a special Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">mobile event, where we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">to be talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">Chrome Racer and have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">the developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2125">behind that join us. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">So with that, I want to say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">thanks, everybody, and thanks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2129">for joining us. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">All right, bye guys. </span></p>
