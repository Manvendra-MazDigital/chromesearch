<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="182"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Well, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">actually really researched </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">Cirque du Soleil, and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">brand, and also the live </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">shows, and we tried to figure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">out where to bring the live </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">show into an interactive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">space. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">And one of the inspirations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">was magic. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">Magic is something that draws us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">in, [INAUDIBLE] to the eye. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">It's visceral. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">There's emotion behind it, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">that's where we, kind of &mdash; we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">thought about magic. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">Magic [INAUDIBLE]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="222"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: So what about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">magic of Cirque du Soleil sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">of brought you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">that experience? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">What were some of the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">that you thought about that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">would translate well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">to the web? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="234"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Well, one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">the things that I think Cirque </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">du Soleil does extremely, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">extremely well is, it kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">is a feast of sense. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">It's so beautiful, there's so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">many colors, there's so many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">things going on. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">It's just hyper, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">hyper gorgeous. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">[INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">points, well, one of the points </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">that we wanted to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">careful of was that in a live </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">experience, we feel connected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">in ways that we don't when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">we sit behind a computer. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">And so one of our wants was to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">really figure out how we could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">get closer to the action and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">experience it, maybe, in that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">same way we would with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">a live event. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="280"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">And Gillian, for you, as you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">started to look at this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">project and start thinking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">this project, where did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">the inspiration come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">from for you? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="291"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: I think for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">us, the first meetings we had, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="294">the two things that came up as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="294">themes in terms of bringing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">Cirque du Soleil to the world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">of the web was curiosity is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">something that Cirque </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">creates for their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">audience as a way to engage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="306">So as Nicole said, it's magical, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">and you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">understand what's behind that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">magic or where that magic is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">going to take you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="314">So that idea of still being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">able stretch people's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">imagination and initiate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">curiosity, which would give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">someone the desire, then, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">move forward and into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">experience, in the sense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">of interactivity. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="329">And the other thing that came </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">up for us is adventure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="332">Because the web gives this sense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">that you can access the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">whole world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="337">What's the edge of the map? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">How far can you go? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">And how wide can you reach? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">So [INAUDIBLE] came up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">curiosity, in the sense of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">magic, and adventure. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="346"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool I think, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">me, one of the really amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">things about the web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">is that we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">always pushing it forward. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">Or we're always trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">to push it forward. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">And that's certainly one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">main components of Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">experiments is, like, we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">take the web here, and what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">do to push it to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">really neat thing? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">And how do we make it do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">something it's never seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">somebody do before? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">Nicole, when you started working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">on this, how did the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">technology affect your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">inspiration? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="383"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Well, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">actually going back to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">live shows. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">Even though you're not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">necessarily interacting, it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">still a 3D experience. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">And one of the things that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">really wanted was to have it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">be engaging in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">3D experience. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">And so that's where we came up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">with the idea that we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">using a 2D world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">in a 3D space. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">And so I think the technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">allowed us to really create a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">layered environment. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">And that, I think, started to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">snowball into, how do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">create a layered environment? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">What does it do? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">How does it react? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">Why does react? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">And I think that's a good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">question is, why? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">Why use technology? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">And it's really to tell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">more of a story. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="436"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: So you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">technology being a good way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">tell a better story and engage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">with people in storytelling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">and more dynamic experiences? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="448"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Yeah, from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">an artistic level, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">technology is a paintbrush, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">So it's in size. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="454">You can either use a fat </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">one, or you use a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">smaller one for details. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="458">I think that technology is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">also just a way &mdash; it's an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">outlet to communicate ideas. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="464">And the exciting thing about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="464">it is, like you said, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">never been done before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="469">But also, we can pull in people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">to dream in ways that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">they haven't before. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="473"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">This is a question for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">both of you guys. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">Before you came to the web, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">before you started playing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">with technology, what is your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">creative experiences based on? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">Did it come from painting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">drawing, or did it always </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">really exist around the web? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="500"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Gillian? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">[LAUGHS]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="502"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: Wow. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">Well, my personal history </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">goes way back. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">I've been performing and making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">art since as long as I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">can remember. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">My mother's a designer and an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">artist and an educator. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">But for me, it's been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">mostly live and some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">drawing, music, singing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">But the primary has been live </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">audience, traditional and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">nontraditional stage. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="528"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: OK </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="531"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: And for me, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">my background has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">everything. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">You know, wit Christmas every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">year, I got a new art kit. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">I was constantly a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">little artist. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">I started, actually, in college </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">as a performance and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">filmmaking and painting. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">[LAUGHS]. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">And then I immediately, after </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">college, went into games. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">And I painted sets for games. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">And that started my interest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">in interactive. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">And so I took this fine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">art world and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">started making it digital. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">I was really quite lucky. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="572"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">Gillian, when Nicole and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">crew first sat down with you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="579">guys and said, hey, here's this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="579">really cool experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">that we're thinking about doing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">and showed some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="586">their inspiration and mood </span><span class="line" data-startTime="586">boards, what did you think of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">what they were showing and where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">they were going with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">some of these things? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="595"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: Well, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">first thing that was, I think, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">exceptional and almost magical, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">really, to use the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">word, was that we had prepared </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">a mood board, and there was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">actually one image that we both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">had chosen for our mood </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">board, of all that's possible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">to find on the net. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="610">So that was kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">mind blowing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="612">When they presented their mood </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">board, we looked at each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="615">other, like, we didn't give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="615">that to them, did we? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">No, we haven't talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">to each other. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="619">So there was an immediate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">complicity and common vision </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">that was obvious from that and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">from a few other things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="628">And the other thing, from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">Cirque's point of view, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="631">was a strong indicator was &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="634">I can't remember, I think was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="634">Nicole, but somebody brought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">up the idea of the screen, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">you might call the fourth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">wall, and how to playfully </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">interact with your audience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="646">Like now, even, this is live, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="646">we're talking &mdash; how do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">interact through this new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">form of communicator? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">And that was something we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">definitely curious about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="654">So those were the two things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="654">that pretty much nailed it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="658"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">Nicole, what were your feelings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">on those first couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">of meetings, when you sat down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">and said, this is what we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="665">thinking, going from a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="665">web and creative background to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">a company who's all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">about doing live, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">in-person kind of stuff? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="676"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: It was super, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">super exciting, obviously, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">mean, I kind of a dream </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">come true, really. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">To work with such a creative, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">imaginative, really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">responsible company, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">kind of rare. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">But I think the challenge of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">it all was thrilling, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">really kind of crack open the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">nut a little bit and be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">to do take a step into a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">direction of interactive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="708">performing is super exciting. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="712"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: So as you started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">working on some of this stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">and sort of took the technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">with your vision, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">how did the technology change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">the way that you saw the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">vision being done as you were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">working through the project? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="730"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Well, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">I'm a developer's worst </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">nightmare in that [INAUDIBLE], </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">because I think I know enough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">of what technology can do, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">know where we can push it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">I think that one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">challenges for us, from a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">development standpoint was, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">could we get things in time? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">Could different technologies be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">available at that moment? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="758">I think that was our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="758">biggest challenge. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="762"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: So whether and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">when technology came on, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">whether you had access to it? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="769"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Yeah, and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">think that usually the process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">of how I work in an interactive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">space is, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="775">dream, and then we kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="775">of dial it back. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">And then we become detectives </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">and solve problems, which is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="783">I think, the best-case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="783">scenario. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">Solving problems means we move </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">forward, which is [INAUDIBLE]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="791"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Were there any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">problems that you were really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="794">proud of having solved with this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="794">project, technology-wise, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">creativity-wise? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="799"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: That's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">really good question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">I think you'll notice that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">there's an incredible amount </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">of layered sprites and divs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">figuring out what a system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="815">could handle. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">And you dream big and so you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">have, like, seven videos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">playing, and all these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">animations, and then there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">all these huge files. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">And then really figuring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">out, OK, now we have &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">it's not moving on a computer. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">So nobody can watch it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="832">It looks great, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="832">nobody can see it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">Really figuring out what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">that wait was. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">So how do we turn this down, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">still, how do we maintain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="841">our vision? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="843"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="845"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: That was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">definitely a big challenge. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="846"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="850">What was it like going through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="850">the process of saying, OK, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="854">we've got our idea here. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">What did the workflow look like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">to say, all right, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">here's our idea, after those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">first meetings with Cirque, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">then go and get to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">final project? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="866"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Well, we took </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">some time and wrote the story. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">That was super fun, just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">to tell the narrative. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">And then once we had the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">narrative, we actually made it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">a functioning animatic And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">from the animatic, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">kind of gave us the answer of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">flow and also an asset list, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">which was super important. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="891"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: For each of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">different scenes, yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="894"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">then we shot it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">And then at the shoot, we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">able to kind of pull in video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">live and be able to see how it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">moved and whether or not our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">horizon line was correct, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">overshooting it, or even just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="908">if it was a worthwhile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="908">experience. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">And then from there on, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">it was just, go. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="916"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: And Gillian, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">did you see, and how did your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">team work with Nicole to really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">take that vision from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">beginning to end? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="929"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: I think the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="929">main thing was keeping in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="931">touch all along the way so that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="931">everybody had a sense of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">what was happening, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">it looked like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="938">Did it match what we wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="938">and imagined? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">I can't think of any specific </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">obstacle, but I know that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">hit a bunch. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="947">And Nicole probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="947">remembers this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="949">We would always say, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">that's because something else </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">even better's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">show up, which it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">actually did, often. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="958">The part that was most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="958">interesting, for us, I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">say, was the actual shoot and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">watching how the artists, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="965">themselves, how Nicole was able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="965">to translate to them what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="971">their work was going to look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="971">like in the final product. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="974">Because a live performer knows, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="974">they're onstage when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="977">it's happening. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="979">So what they give comes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="979">from that knowledge. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="981">And so Nicole was able to inform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="981">them the context that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="984">they were performing in, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="984">it would look like, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">they were able to play and adapt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">with that, which was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="990">exciting for us to see that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="991"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Yeah, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="991">I think that's where the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">animatic played an incredible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">role, and also being able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">input stuff immediately live. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">In a green screen environment, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">it's cold. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1005">There's no connection. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">And I think that was super </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">exciting that we were able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1012">show the artists where they were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1012">in the space and really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">let them have that world and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">take over that world. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1021"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah, actually, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">just got some of the green </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">screen video set up so that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">can see have a quick peek at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1030">that, I think. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1031">Let me see if I can get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1031">that running here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1034">There we go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1035">So we've got some picture in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1035">picture going so that folks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1038">can see what's going on there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1039">So this was the scene where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">our guide jumps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1045">backwards off the log. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1047">And you can see her there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">on that blue screen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1052">Nicole, as we run through that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1052">what was your process of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1054">thinking through how to do these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1054">things, because you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1058">just this blue screen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1059">And the artist has really no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">idea, we have really no idea, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1064">until we see what's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1064">on, what to expect. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1069"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Well, what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">tried to do is to have some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">key frames to show the artist </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">where they were in the space, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">and also for us to be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">to plan appropriately. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1080">This is an A-camera. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1083">We don't have a B-camera to cut </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">to, so the entire scene is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1088">first person POV. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1090">So we really needed to make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1090">that there was a thread </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">throughout &mdash; like a breadcrumb </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">trail continuous, throughout </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1097">the experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1099">And with these frames, we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">also able to build out the 3D </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">experience, and then immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">key the video and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">put them into an environment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">to help the artist see what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">space they were working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">in, and to &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1121">what was the first film of Star </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1121">Wars that came out, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1124">they used blue screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1124">everywhere? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1129"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: The remakes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">or the &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1132"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: The new ones. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1132"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Oh, yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1133"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: I just remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">how cold that was. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1136">There was no connection. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">And there was just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">these two people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">speaking to one another. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">We were joking and saying, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">do not want to create that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1149"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Gillian, for you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">guys, was this the first big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1153">web project that you guys had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1153">worked on at Cirque du Soleil? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">Or how had you guys worked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">with the web before? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1161"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: It was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">the first creative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1162">project, I would say. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1163">Obviously Cirque has done lots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1163">of marketing, and the company </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">website, and other, more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">traditional, transitions to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">the web, doing things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">people were doing anyway, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">before the web, but in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">a different way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1176">But this was the actual &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">the content was created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">for this project, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">it was fully creative. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1182">[INAUDIBLE]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1185"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Were you somewhat </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1185">skeptical at the beginning, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1187">did you think that we would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1187">be able to create such an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">immersive, Cirque-like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">experience right off the bat? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1198"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: I'm a highly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1198">optimistic person, so I wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">skeptical, because I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">almost never am. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1203">But I would say there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1203">were definitely lots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">of people who were. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">And the minute we met Nicole and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">their team, that went out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1212">the window. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1212">Their enthusiasm &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">and maybe they were as highly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">optimistic, but they were the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1219">experts, and they seemed really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1221">excited that it was possible. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1223">So that schooled us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1223">pretty quickly. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1226"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">awesome, yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">How would you describe the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">difference between working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">with a web experience and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">working with a live show, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">starting something like that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1240"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: Wow, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">a good question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1242">It's completely different, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1242">because, from the beginning, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1246">your framework is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1246">not a theater. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">It's not an audience. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1252">It's a platform, in a way. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">It's a tool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1254">But there's much more unknown, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1254">which can be exciting, except </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1260">that, when you're doing a show, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1260">the parameters are very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">concrete and practical. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1265"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">GILLIAN FERRABEE: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">Go ahead Nicole? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1268"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: I was just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">going to say, I think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1270">practical because it's known. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">Because we haven't defined the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">process of interactive &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1276">there is no cookie cutter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1276">process, necessarily. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1280">I think that that's the exciting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1280">and the scary part. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">GILLIAN FERRABEE: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">It's definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">exciting for Cirque. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">And the first question we asked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">ourselves is, what are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1292">all the things that we can't do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1292">in a live show because of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1295">the parameters of time, or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1295">weight of something, or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">feasibility, visually? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1303">The suspension of disbelief is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1303">completely different live. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">So it's a very exciting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">terrain. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">I mean, Cirque has always been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">interested in the unknown, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1318">Nicole said. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1319"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: So what were some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">of the things that, right off </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">the bat, when you said, what are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">the things we can't do a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1324">live show, what were some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1324">things that you said, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1326">can't do, could we do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1326">these on the web? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1331"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: The first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1331">thing that comes up is, in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">web, you have, to some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">degree more say how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1341">the story is told. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1342">Because live, you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1342">know where the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">person's going to look. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1345">Which Cirque is a real master </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1345">of giving people lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1349">things to look at and, in a way, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1349">guiding their attention. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1355">So that's different. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1356">On the web, it gives more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">of a traditional </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">storytelling process. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1362">And the other thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1362">is practical &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1366">like, to get something onto </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1366">stage takes time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1369">And to get it off takes time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1371">And when you're shooting, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1371">can do that before you turn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1374">the camera on for however </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1374">long it takes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1377">So that's a very practical and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">very creative examples. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1383"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Were there any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">things in the Movi.Kanti.Revo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1386">experience that you pushed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1386">to have them try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1391">some of those things? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1397"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: Nothing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1397">comes to mind because my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1399">experience is that Nicole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1399">and [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1402">surprised us over and over. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1404">We didn't have time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1404">to catch up. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1408"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: From our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">perspective, I think it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1410">about, really, how to challenge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1410">this experience of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">intimate, a one-on-one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">experience, whereas in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1419">theater, there's many, many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1419">people around you. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">So how do I engage somebody in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">the one-on-one experience? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1426">And then also perspective &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">we can gauge perspective </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">behind a computer. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1433">In a theater, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1433">in a seat. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">[INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1437">that Cirque does an amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1437">job doing many shows, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1441">you're moving around the space </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1441">as much as they're moving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1445">around you. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">But I think that's a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">super interesting thing for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1448">how to translate live experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1448">in the future is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1452">it's a virtual theater seat. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1455"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1455">that's a perfect segue into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1459">the next question I have, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1459">is, what do you think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">that the web brings to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">experiences that you can't do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1466">in a live show? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1469">And where do you see that going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1469">and changing the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1474">some, not just Cirque shows, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1474">in all live entertainment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">changes in the future? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1483"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">a very good &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1486">I mean, I don't really think we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1486">know quite yet until we do. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">Because I think the wonderful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">part of about doing stories </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">interactively is that every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">single time, we find out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">something new about a way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">engage somebody differently. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1502">And that's, I think, the part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1502">of the process that is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1508">most challenging, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1508">it's almost like &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">and I think this is why my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">developers kind of hate me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1513">sometimes &mdash; not hate me, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1513">but obviously, raise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">their fist to me &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1519">is because I think I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1519">constantly using technology in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">ways that it's not supposed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">to be used. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1525">And that's how we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1525">move forward. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1527">That's how we push the lines. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1530"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: I think one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1530">things that really excites </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">me with the web is, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">not always about &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1537">the technology is not supposed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1537">to used this way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1539">It's that as browser vendors, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1539">as the people who make the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1545">specifications develop stuff, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1545">they say, hey, we think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1550">going to get used this way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1551">But then creative, brilliant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1551">people like you guys come in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1555">and say, oh, hey, if I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1555">do this and this, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1560">can get this to happen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1561">And suddenly you get something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1561">that's never really been seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1565">or done before. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1567"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Yeah, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1567">like using a hammer for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">something else other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">than nailing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">If there's a tool available, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">then it can kind of push us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">into ways that we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">reveal yet. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1582"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: One other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1582">thing that comes to mind from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">a live [? performance ?] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">point of view is there is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">different kind of intimacy. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">As Nicole was saying, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">move the camera into places </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1592">that you can't always </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1592">see from your seat. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1596">And then the other thing that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1596">way out there is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">web provides a different kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">of live, which is &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">for instance, in the way that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">if you're using an app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">sometimes you can see who else </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">is using it at that moment. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">There's a collective </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">participation over time and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1614">space that you never have with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1614">the limitations of 1,200 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">people from 8:00 to 10:30 or any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">form of live experience. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">There's that potential for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">a different kind of live. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1627"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: And a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">new and exciting unity. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">There's people that are coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">together that would never have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">the opportunity to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">come together. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1639">It's incredibly exciting. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1642"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">Well, let's talk about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">workflow, a little bit, of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">taking some of the actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">practical things and putting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1651">them onto the web into some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1651">of those experiences. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1655">So Nicole, as you started going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1655">through and saying, OK, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">this is what I want some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">these scenes to look like, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1662">did you say &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">for example, the tree </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">of life scene &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">how did you translate that from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">being something in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1670">head to being something very, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1670">like, touch, like, I can go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">and see that, I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">move around? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1679"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: I think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">that this is about sketching. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1682">We sketched the tree out. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">I kind of [? drew ?] the layout, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">originally, handed it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1689">to some very talented artists, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1689">who painted it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1692"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Now, when you say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1692">painted it, because we've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1695">a lot of different types of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1695">folks who are watching this &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1697">some may be a little bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1697">like me, who are more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">developer oriented. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1701">And for me, I know how to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1701">write some angle bracket </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1706">markup-y like stuff, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1706">anything more than that, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">need your help. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1711">So what's painting it mean, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1711">how do you go about that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1715"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Well, I really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1715">wanted the experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1719">to be very set designed, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1719">also touched by humans. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">So we actually literally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">created paintbrushes in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1728">Photoshop, and if you zoom into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1728">some of the [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1733">the pieces, you'll actually see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1733">the actual paint brushes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">of the artist that digitally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">painted, in Photoshop, each of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1741">the elements that we created. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">Because we wanted it to feel, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">actually, a bit of Renaissance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">[INAUDIBLE]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1754"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">I think you broke up there at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">the last little second, but I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1758">think you were saying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1758">Renaissance paintings, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">each one was hand drawn. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1765"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Yeah, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1765">I'm breaking up. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1768"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: All right, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">hopefully this will clear up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">here in a second. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1774">So from the point where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1774">started taking each thing, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">turned each painting &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">designed each scene in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">Photoshop, where did it go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1783">from there? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1784">So you've got this great PSD </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1784">file that's potentially pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1788">huge, and you can't just hand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1788">that over to a developer. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1792">So what happened next? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1798"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Then we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1798">had this huge PSD, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1803">we pulled it apart. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">Can you hear me, OK? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1812"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: I can now. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1817">All right, looks like we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1817">lost you here for a sec. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">Let's see, Gillian, why don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">we pop over to you for a sec </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1826">and give it a sec for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1826">Nicole's network </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1829">connection to come back. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">What was your favorite scene </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">in this project? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2062"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2062">the tree of life. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2063">I feel like that was the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2063">closest to what I had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2067">envisioned. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">The clown is just &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2071">the fool in love is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2071">so beautiful. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2075"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah it's pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2075">pretty is slightly awkward to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2078">say, but very true. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2081"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: I think what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2081">people love about that is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">the poetry translates. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2087">It's a very poetic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2087">representation of something. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">And everyone I've spoken </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">to got it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">They got the metaphor, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">understood and were very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2099">moved at the end, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2099">when he floats. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">So that's what struck me, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">how, again, this concept of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2104">the web, and a screen, and how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2104">such a depth of human poetry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2108">can translate. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2111"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2111">That was for my grandfather, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2111">actually. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">He's very connected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">with family. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2119">He's just madly in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2119">love with family. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">So I thought that was a nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">homage to my grandfather. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2124"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: Wow. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2125"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Wow, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2125">kind of neat. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">Gillian, how do think Cirque's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">going to approach the web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2134">differently because of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2134">experiment and the way that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2139">people have been responding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2139">to it? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2144"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: How are we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2144">going to respond differently? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">We're just really excited. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2149">It was a delight from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2149">beginning to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">end, the whole process. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">And people have responded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">beyond our expectations, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2156">in-house and everybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2156">outside. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2161">So that only creates the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2161">appetite to continue. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">That's basically what &mdash; in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">big picture, there's lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2168">excitement around it and lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2168">interest and ideas and just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2173">general excitement. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2243"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: Well again, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">it was all new, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">I think, for us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2246">I don't know for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2246">Nicole's team. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2248">I would say Nicole's experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2248">with a diverse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">background, having done film, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">having done live performance, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2257">meant that she knew how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2257">to speak to us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2261">I think that facilitated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">a lot. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2263">And it was really the ongoing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2263">sharing of just where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2266">everybody was at, and a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2266">of visual referencing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2270">And then the big chunk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">was the actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2273">shoot itself, obviously. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2275">That was, I would say, the peak </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">of the collaborative part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2280">on a day-to-day basis. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2283"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">Well, we're getting a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">bit close to the end. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2288">I want to take a look at some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2288">of the questions that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">got from some folks who are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">posting their questions. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">So one of the questions that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">we've got is, where do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">think the web is going to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">with Cirque in 10 years? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2305">And this is, I guess, for both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2305">of you, because I think this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">kind of interesting for both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">of you guys to take. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2312">And I'm going to tack on a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2312">little bit of an extra </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2315">sentence on there &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">not just Cirque, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">performances and art in general. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2325"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: My hope is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2325">it's an experience that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2333">we're participants in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2336">I think that we've come close </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2336">to being able to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2340">engaged on the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2343">I would love to see performance, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2343">especially on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2347">web, become about me feeling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2347">connected in ways that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2351">haven't before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2352">And whether that's with touch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2352">and call and response, meaning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2357">if I touch somebody, do they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2357">have goosebumps, suddenly? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2362">If I touch them hard, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2362">do they get bruised? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">I think that's where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">we're going. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2370"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: OK. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2371">So new interactions and better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2371">ways to touch the audience. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2378"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Yeah, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2378">the audience is suddenly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2383">participants. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">And it's kind of dictated by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">their own personal experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2390">and desire. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2391"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2393">Gillian, what are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2393">your thoughts? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2396"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: I mean, 10 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2396">years is a long way, in terms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2398">of technology, to ever imagine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2398">what's going to have happened. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2402">I think the two most exciting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2402">things &mdash; the first is, kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2406">what Nicole was saying, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2406">I would say around the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2409">refinement and sophistication of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2409">kinesthetic interactivity. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2413">So that's something that Cirque </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2413">thinks about a lot, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">which would allow for the user, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">which is what we call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2422">the name for the person now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2422">whereas we had a conversation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">about it recently where, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">could go so fast, or there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2429">could be so many dimensions that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2429">it's not longer the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2433">and the web, but there's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2433">to be a whole sense of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2436">possibilities of the user being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2436">part of the art, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">influencing the art, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">the art responding to that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2442">and there being so many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2442">possibilities in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2445">that that it really &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2446">the line becomes more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2446">and more blurred. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2449">And then the other one is, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2449">think Nicole mentioned it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2452">earlier, what the web provides </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2452">in terms of the opportunity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">for people to find each other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">that have more and more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2459">specific things in common, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2459">how that's going to affect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2463">art, per se. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2467"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2467">an interesting idea. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2470">So one of the questions that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2470">had, that I wanted to sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2475">continue on with some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2475">things we were talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2476">earlier, is, how do you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2476">want to see technology change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2482">in the near term, so like in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2482">next couple of months, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2486">make these experiences better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2486">or more interactive? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2494"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2494">physically? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2496"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2498"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Alpha channel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2498">video in WebM. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2503"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Why don't you talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2503">a little bit about why </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2506">you want that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2507">Because I know that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2507">something we were trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2509">get in, and unfortunately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2509">we didn't get it in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2512">in time into Chrome. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2514">It's coming soon </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2514">but not quite. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2516"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: It's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2516">something I've wanted, about, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2518">for two years now. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2520"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: OK. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2521"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Because you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2521">have more control of changing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2528">the way a video or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2528">an experience is. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2535">Let me think for a second. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2535">So if I have an alpha channel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2535">video, and my videos are on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2540">rails, meaning I have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2540">narrative that is moving from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2544">A to B, I have no ability to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2544">switch those rails and have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2549">the content or narrative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2549">change quickly. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2553">With alpha channel video, we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2553">have a much more reactive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2560">environment for the user in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2560">the narrative meaning. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2565">And I have hope that that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2565">something that we have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2571">little bit more control over in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2571">the future, is that we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2575">kind of change the narrative on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2575">the fly, depending on what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2579">user is reactive to. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2582"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah and in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">Movi.Kanti.Revo we kind of did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2585">that at one point, where there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2585">the fork in the road </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2588">scene where the user can choose </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2588">which direction to go. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2591">But it's a very limited amount </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2591">of changing on the fly. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2597"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Right, and if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2597">you had a WebM alpha, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2603">possibilities of A or B, becomes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2603">A to Z, which, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2608">would be exciting. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2609"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2612">And Gillian, what about you? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2615"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2615">have the same tech </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2618">knowledge of lingo. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2620">But two things that come to mind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2620">for me, it's simply that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2624">people think about interactivity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2624">as a full-bodied </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2627">experience. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2629">Obviously, being a dancer from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2629">Cirque, that's the first thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2632">that comes to mind. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2633">Anything to facilitate, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2633">encourage, and play with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2637">people using their whole body, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2637">not just hands and eyes. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2642">And the other thing is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2642">context and the environment. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2646">I love the idea of anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2646">where the screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2648">is somewhere different. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2651">It's on the street, it's on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2651">floor, the screen comes to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2657">me more in my world than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2657">just at my computer. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2662">I think that as a 3D dancer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2662">person, that's what I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2666">looking for. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2667"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: I think that's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2667">really powerful piece, that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2671">are interacting with more and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2671">more screens every day, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2674">whether you're talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2674">your smartphone, whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2677">you're talking about your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2677">laptop, your desktop, maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2680">it's a tablet that you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2680">walking around with. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2682">There are just so many different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2682">screens that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2685">we have access to. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2686">And seeing these experiences </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2686">on more and more of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2690">scenes, I think, is phenomenally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2690">powerful and a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2693">really cool, fun thing to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2693">see the web change. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2697"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: I think It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2697">opens up the possibility for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2700">surprise, which is one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2700">best things in life and also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2704">neat in that we all all live </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2704">in worlds, often, that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2709">very busy, and very repetitive, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2709">and where we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2713">physical routines in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2713">our life every day. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2715">So the idea that a screen can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2715">play the part of a magical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2722">moment, the way flash mobs work, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2722">dance mobs, where at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2727">beginning, you're going to work, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2727">and you're going through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2730">central station as you do every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2730">morning, and then, ahh, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2731">people start dancing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2733">So how can screens or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2733">capacity for screens to be in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2736">new places begin to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2736">provide that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2741"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Yeah, and how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2741">do we show something new, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2744">exciting, and different to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2744">people who wouldn't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2748">access to new and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2748">exciting things? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2753"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2754">Well, so I want to wrap up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2754">one question for both of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2759">you guys to answer. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2761">And it's really about, if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2761">could say to other designers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2765">and creative folks, after having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2765">worked through this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2768">project, what would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2768">you say to them? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2771">How would you encourage them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2771">to go and play with this? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2774">Or what would you say? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2781"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: To &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2781">playing with Movi? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2785"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2786"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: I would love </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2786">for people to go and see it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2789">and experience it, and be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2789">excited by it, but also to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2794">help us move forward </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2794">with technology. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2796">And how would they do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2796">it differently? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2798">What would they do to make the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2798">story have more depth or add </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2805">more creativity to it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2807">And then go do it so that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2807">kind of keep leapfrogging and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2811">progressing, and inspiring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2811">each other. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2815"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2817">And Gillian, what are your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2817">thoughts on that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2821"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: My thoughts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2821">are to encourage other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2823">physically creative people &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2823">so that would mean anyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2825">whose art form is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2825">their own body &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2828">to being playing with people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2828">whose art form is technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2833">Because I was so surprised, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2833">with this project, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2841">visceral my response to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2841">artists was, how much I could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2845">really feel them, and their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2845">personalities, and their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">charisma, and what they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">were emanating. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2851">So I think that's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2851">encouraging for people who are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2854">physical performers, to know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2854">that when you partner with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">right artist of technology, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2858">they're as excited as you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2862">have that happen. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2864"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2865">So we just actually had one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2865">question pop in on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2868">question list that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2868">think is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2870">a really neat question. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2874">And the answer I'll give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2874">immediately is, not right now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2879">but I'm curious what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2879">you guys think. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2881">Is there any possibility of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2881">Movi.Kanti.Revo being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2884">implemented on Google Glass and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2884">this virtual space being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2889">overlaid in the real world? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2890">How do you guys see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2890">actually happening? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2894">Because &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2895">NICOLE MCDONALD: [INAUDIBLE]. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2901">We have actually talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2901">about it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2902">And we have some ideas on how to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2902">make this almost, kind of, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2908">be an interactive flash mob. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2913"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Oh neat. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2914"><span class="speakerName">Nicole Mcdonald</span>: Yeah, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2914">potentially could be putting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2916">it in places that surprise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2916">us and draw us in. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2923"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Gillian, are you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2923">familiar with Google Glass? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2925"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: No. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2927"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: Google Glass is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2927">a project that Google has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2930">started working on. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2932">It's a research project for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2932">most part right now, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2935">effectively what it is is it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2935">a pair of glasses that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2938">wear that have a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2938">display right here. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2941">And you can interact with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2941">it in all kinds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2943">of different ways. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2945">So the video that they showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2945">was showing being able to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2950">maps, but being able to send </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2950">messages, call people, talk to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2954">people, because you have that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2954">display right there in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2958">field of view, or maybe it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2958">little bit above, or something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2961">to that effect. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2962">But you've always got that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2962">technology right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2965">there around you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2969"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2969">had heard of it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2969">I didn't know what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2969">it was called. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2970"><span class="speakerName">Pete LePage</span>: OK, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2970">for something like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2974">Movi.Kanti.Revo, how do you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2974">that, maybe, playing into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2977">something like this? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2979"><span class="speakerName">Gillian Ferrabee</span>: Well, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2979">comes to mind first is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2981">obvious one, of the characters </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2981">being a part of your daily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2984">life, and making even more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2984">practical uses playful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2989">So if it's a map, as happened in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2989">the forest, that they could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2995">playfully feed you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2995">the information. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2999">And the other thing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2999">comes to mind is just &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3003">my memory is that, in our brain, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3003">80% of our receptors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3005">are visual, and it affects our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3005">whole body and our brains in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3009">ways that we're just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3009">learning about now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3011">So I think there's possibilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3011">beyond that that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3013">the biological science </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3013">is going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3015">meet us on that front. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3018">Who knows what it would do to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3018">your body to think you were in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3021">a forest when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3021">are in a city. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3025">And if the forest is peopled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3025">with fun, magical people, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3030">would your whole body relax? </span></p>
