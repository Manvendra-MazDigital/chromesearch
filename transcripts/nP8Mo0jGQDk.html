<p><span class="line" data-startTime="4">Hi, my name is Henry Bridge and I am the Product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">Manager for Native Client. I am here today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">to talk to you about our developer pre-release </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">of the Native Client SDK. This video will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">help you get familiar with the SDK and with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">developing web apps that take advantage of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">native code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="19">For those of you who are new to this technology, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">Native Client is an open source project that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">allows you to run native code in a web browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="29">This capability allows you to take the many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">useful existing libraries written in languages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">like C or C++ and use them in your web app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="33">For example, say you wanted to run photo filters </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">on your web gallery application. You could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">use existing libraries that allow users to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">seamlessly perform smooth image manipulation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">on your photos without leaving your website, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">and without installing other software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="47">Web applications that use Native Client consist </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">of parts that are written in HTML, JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">and CSS, as well as parts that are written </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">in native code. The HTML, Java Script, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">CSS parts are deployed as text files. For </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">the native code portions, you will need a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">compiler that produces Native Client binaries. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="69">The Native Client SDK comes with a modified </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">version of GCC that will compile C or C++ </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">code to native code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="74">Imagine you want to write a video editing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">application for the web. You can write your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">UI and basic program logic (such as metadata </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">field editing and timeline controls) in HTML, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">JavaScript and CSS. But when it comes to implementing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">the code to modify the video data, what is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">the right approach? You could implement the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">video editing on the server but this approach </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">would waste bandwidth and also feel slow. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="100">On the other hand, you could try and implement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">the video editing code that would run on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">client in JavaScript but this would be difficult </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">to implement and would also be slow. Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">Client allows you to get the best of both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">worlds: download the data once to the client, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">and do the editing there. Periodically, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">application can just push a changelog up to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">the server for processing &mdash; without impacting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">performance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="125">To get started, download our SDK from code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="125">The getting started guide on this site will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">walk you through installing the SDK so you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">can begin building applications. Once you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">have setup your development environment properly, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">navigate your browser to the hello world example. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="145">Then click the hello world button, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">will get a dialog that pops up that is already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">made a round trip into native C++ code! Now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">lets see how this works. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="155">You can view source on the web page and see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">that the hello world HTML page loads the Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">Client module using an embed tag. On successful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">load, a global variable pointing to the Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">Client module is set. An onclick handler is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">then set for the hello world button, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">in turn calls the helloworld() function on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">the Native Client module. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="175">Following this function call down into native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">code, observe that the Invoke() call determines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">what method was called via a string compare. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="180">Since the helloworld() function was called, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">it then calls InvokeHW(), which copies hello, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">world into the result buffer. The result is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">then passed back to JavaScript when the function </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">returns and is displayed as an alert dialog </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">in JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="195">Now try modifying the hello world text that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">is passed back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="198">Recompile the Native Client module by opening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">up a terminal cd-ing to the sdk/examples directory, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">and running make. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="209">Reload the web page and the message will change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">when you click the hello world button. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="213">While this simple hello world example is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">long way from a compelling application, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">hope it is clear how Native Client makes it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">possible to weave high-performance native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">C and C++ methods into a web application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="222">To make the best use of the power of running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">native code in a web application, Native Client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">includes APIs to expose useful functionality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">beyond message passing between JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">and native code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="236">To handle resource management, Native Client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">provides a set of low level Linux-like APIs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">such as malloc and mmap that allow you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">handle resource allocation in the sandboxed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">system environment. In order to access browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">resources like the network, or communicate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">with the DOM, Native Client exposes NPAPI. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="251">Finally, to provide platform independent multimedia </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">interfaces such as 2D and 3D graphics, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">Audio, Native Client modules can interface </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">with the NPAPI Pepper interfaces to OpenGL </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">ES 2.0 and to a stereo audio system. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="269">As an example of the kinds of compelling experiences </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">you can create with these APIs, here is some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">footage of a port we have done of Nexuiz, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">an open source modern Quake engine that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">ported to Native Client and to OpenGL ES 2.0. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="278">If you are attending Google IO, come to our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">Beyond JavaScript talk for a deep dive on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">the SDK, or come meet the team at the Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">Sandbox.
