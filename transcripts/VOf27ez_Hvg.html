<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/VOf27ez_Hvg">youtu.be/VOf27ez_Hvg</a><div id="transcript"><p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: Hi. Good afternoon. Welcome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3">to the history and future of Google Web Toolkit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="7">My name is ray Cromwell, I'm tech lead for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">GWT. So I'd like to just jump right in because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">we've got seven years, believe it or not, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">of history to cover. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="20">So, often people actually come up to me and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">say why did Google even create GWT in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">first place? Isn't JavaScript good enough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">for you? Why do you need Java for Web programming? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">So I think it's instrumental to go back and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">look at the context in which GWT was conceived </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">seven years ago. So if you think back seven </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">years ago, which is an eternity in Web time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">Web 2.0 was just starting, AJAX apps, rich </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">internet applications were just being created, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">the first sort of series of them. And people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">were actually thinking back then that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">future of rich internet applications was going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">to be something like a war between Adobe Air </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">and Microsoft Silverlight. I mean, there were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">conventions on this. And people did not think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">that the browsers were powerful enough to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">do really, really capable applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="68">And then Google released Gmail in 2004 and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">Google Maps in 2005, and I think that started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">to change people's imagination because for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">the first time, especially with Google Maps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">people saw an application that was written </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">in the Web that was fast, it was fluid, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">was &mdash; in fact, this was before touch. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">was touchable. The way you interacted with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">the Google Maps application is you grabbed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">it with the mouse pointer and flung the map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">around. So that fired up people's imagination </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">and people really wanted to start building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">rich Web applications like this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="98">But at the time if you looked around and surveyed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">the landscape there wasn't a lot of good tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">to do this in just raw JavaScript by hand. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="108">In fact, jQuery, which is really the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">popular library out there, wasn't even released </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">until 2006. And I think probably Bruce Johnson </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">and Joe Weber who created GWT were sitting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">around somewhere in a cafe and saying How </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">can we solve this problem without building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">our own JavaScript bidi, JavaScript testing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">frameworks and build servers and all this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">other kind of stuff that's been there for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">a long time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="131">And if you look at Java they were like wow, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">it has seven million programmers, it has intelliJ </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">and Eclipse, it's got Ant and Maven and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">got J Unit and Test Mg and it has bug analysis </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">software and dependency package management </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">and all this stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="145">The only thing you can't do with it is you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">can't write a client side Web application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">except if you want to do applets or something. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="148">If I could only compile Java to JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">it would close the loop and we would get massive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">leverage on that ecosystem. So that I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">was the foundation context for GWT. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="159">So it's evolved a lot since then. The first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">version of GWT was released in 2006, followed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">very shortly by a few other versions that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">really didn't add much to fix bugs. The really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">important thing is with GWT 1.3 in 2007 early </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">on we released it as open source. And for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">the first time everyone could contribute to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">GWT if they wanted to. And it was also the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">first to get OSX support. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="189">Later in 2007 we added J Unit testing framework </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">support as well as automatic sprite sheeting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="195">This was another first because back in 2007 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">we were automatically creating CSS sprite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">sheets on the fly well before actually people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">had built tools to do this for hand-coded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">JavaScript. But the biggest thing people were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">asking us over and over again is when are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">you going to have Java 5 support? We want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">generics, we want enoms, we want auto boxing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">all that stuff. So they did a fire drill, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">they crunched down and in 2008 they got Java </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">1.5 support. In fact, 1.5 was one of the biggest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">releases. It added not just Java 1.5 support, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">but this new overlay type system that allowed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">you to link with JavaScript for the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">time with zero overhead in the compiler. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">had a new low level DOM API, and we added </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">CSS themes to the widgets for the first time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">so everyone who used GWT early on knew that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">the widgets no style whatsoever. Out of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">box it just looked like nothing. So we added </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">a couple of CSS themes so at least out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">the box someone could actually look at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">app and not puke. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="249">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="251"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: And we added this thing called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">linkers which has some useful things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">I can perhaps get into later. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="255">And with 2009 we basically redid the event </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">handler system to make event handling more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">generic and not just tied to the DOM. Now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">you could fire custom events and reuse events </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">on both the client and in your server code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="270">We added code coverage support with Emma. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="270">We added war directory support so you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">just point our tools at a war directory and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">it would work. And we added a parallelized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">build system that today is mostly used by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">Google. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="281">In 2009 we had a minor release that mostly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">just added support. 2009, though, was the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">year of a really big release, and that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">GWT 2.0. And GWT 2.0 was an overhaul. It was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="294">the biggest release ever. We added a totally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="294">new dev mode so that you could develop in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">development mode with any browser you liked. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="298">So whether it was Chrome or whether it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">IE, whether it was Safari, Firefox, you had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">the same experience. Previously we were bundling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">a really old version of Firefox or IE directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">into the GWT toolkit, so you couldn't even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">upgrade the browser you were developing with. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="313">We added draft compilation to speed up your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">compiles. We added this new templating system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">called UI binder. We added layout panels for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">really efficient CSS style layout. And we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">added the code splitter, which was an overhaul </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">to compiler to allow you to tell the compiler </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">that certain pieces of code don't need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">be loaded when your app starts up, but they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">can be loaded later. And a new system for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">bundling resources into your application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">which was called client bundle, which was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">the evolution of image bundle, which did sprite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">sheets. With client bundle we also bundle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">in CSS and we have a CSS compiler that performs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">optimizations on the CSS to shrink that down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">as well. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="353">In 2010 we partnered with VMWare to support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">their cloud, and that necessitated a new RPC </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">system that was not as tied to Java as GWT </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">RPC was, and that was request factory, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">was a more JSON oriented RPC framework. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">did data binding with the editor framework. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="370">JSR 303 bean validation support, model view </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">presenter pattern support, and a new system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">of cell widgets which are efficient widgets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">for rendering like tables and grids. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="382">Then we had a couple of minor releases. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">acquired this company called Instantiations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">and we released as open source WYSIWYG designer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">for GWT UIs. We added a lot of HTML5 support, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">like canvas and storage and things like that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="399">And we dropped in a little bit of stuff for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">Google in terms of enhancing app integration. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="406">And then finally, in the last release we sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">of started to think that we need to move off </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">Ant and get more towards Maven, so we sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">of Mavenized it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="414">So that's where we were. That's the history </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">of GWT. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="419">So where are we today? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">Well, as far as we can tell the SDK has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">downloaded over a million times, but that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">probably not an accurate number because a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">lot of people are getting it from Maven central </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">now. We have over 100,000 monthly active developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="433">Because software basically periodically checks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">to see if there's a new version to give you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">a notification that GWT 2.5 is available. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="437">So we at least know of Eclipse users there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">100,000 active developers. We have deep integration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">with Eclipse through the Google Eclipse plug-in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">with intelliJ and with VMWare spring tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="447">And our products are used widely within Google, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">including our biggest product, which is AdWords, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">Google Flights, Offers, Google Groups, Blogger, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">many that you haven't even imagined that were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">written in GWT. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="463">And we did a couple of fun things. We ported </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">Quake, first-person shooter in 2009 using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">GWT to the Web and it ran smoothly at 60 frames </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">per second in a browser, and Angry Birds for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">the Web, if you've ever played for Chrome, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">is written in GWT. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="477">So GWT today is a mature, high quality code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">base. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="482">What more could we do? Is there anything left </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">to actually do to improve GWT? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">And I'm happy to say over the last year we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">done a lot. In fact, the GWT 2.5 release that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">we're introducing today is the largest release </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">we've done, I think, since GWT 2.1. We've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">added more stuff in 2.5 than we did in 2.2, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">2.3, 2.4 put together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="505">Let me go over a few of them. First, we did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="505">a lot of work on the compiler. So out of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">box with no changes to your code, if you just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">recompile your application you will get a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">substantial code size reduction. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="516">For example, the showcase application, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">you just recompile the GWT 2.5, 14% smaller </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">JavaScript. And that is undercounting because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">the GWT user library has added a lot more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">bloat in terms of the underlying library code. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="532">So it probably would have been even smaller. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="532">The mobile Web app, eight percent smaller. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="536">Your mileage may vary. The larger the app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">probably the better the benefit. Smaller apps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">smaller benefit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="540">But we can do better. We also integrated the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">JavaScript closure compiler that is used at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">Google for like Gmail and Google+ and Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">Docs and a lot of other large JavaScript applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="550">And the closure compiler has a lot of really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="556">low level JavaScript optimizations that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="556">never really would think to do in GWT because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">it's Java oriented, things like putting bang </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">zero instead of true or if you have a number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">like 10,000, rewrite it as 1E4 in scientific </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">language. It saves off two bytes. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="572">So here you can see if you enable closure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">compiler you get an extra five percent co-size </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">reduction. So now versus GWT 2.4, recompiled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">with the switch closure compiler, we're 20% </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">smaller than GWT 2.4. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="584">But we can do better. We've also looked at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">the code splitter and so the showcase application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">for example, does a live code splitting. If </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">you're not aware of what code splitting does, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">it allows you to pick parts of your application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">like a composed window or settings page, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">may not be displayed immediately when your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">application is loaded up. You can mark them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">as split points that the compiler has the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">option of deferring and loading later. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">it can move that code out into a separate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">JS file, shrinking the initial size of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">JS that has to be loaded. So any bit of code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">that is exclusive to one particular fragment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">and is not shared is called exclusive code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="623">What I'm showing up here is there's split </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">points. They have some code that is only referenced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">within those split points, and if there is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">some like, let's say, job util list that both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="631">of them use, and so any time there's shared </span><span class="line" data-startTime="631">code we put that code in a shared fragment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">called the leftovers fragment. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="636">Here's the problem. As you continue to increase </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">the number of split points in your application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">the probability of there being shared code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="646">between any two split points rises. And what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="646">that means is that that leftovers fragment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">at the bottom gets larger and larger. So when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">your application loads up, before it can run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">any of these split points it has to load the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">leftovers fragment because it's a shared library. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="661">So we needed to do something about that leftovers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">fragment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="664">What we do is we perform a kind of clustering. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="664">We analyze all the fragments that you've split </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">out and looked for ones that are most similar, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">that basically use the most amount of code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">together, and we merge them into one fragment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="674">And hopefully there's a lot of shared code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">that no longer is used by anybody else. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">only used now within that new merged fragment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">that you see in the middle of the screen. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="686">That leaves the leftovers fragment down at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">the bottom empty where we've hoisted some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">code out of it into this new shared fragment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="695">So what can of effect can this have on an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">application like Showcase? 39% reduction in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">code size of the initial JavaScript that your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">application has to load before it can present </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">the UI to the user. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="705">The first time I saw this I thought we had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">a bug in the compiler and it was wrong, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">was removing too much code, but I've measured </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">it several times and it's true. 39% code size </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">reduction. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="720">But there are other things we had to do. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="720">had to improve the overall diagnostics of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">the compiler. Things that you might rely on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">like if someone is running your application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">and a user hits an exception, how are you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">going to find out what happened and what line </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">of code it happened on? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">So there's this new standard that Google has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="737">proposed and other people have adopted called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="737">source maps. What it does is whenever you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="740">compile anything to JavaScript, be it Java, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="740">Closure, Coffee Script, whatever, we write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">out the standardized mapping file which says </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">this piece of Java or Coffee Script or whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">source language became this bit of obfuscated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">JavaScript in the output. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="753">But having that bidirectional mapping, now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">when you go to debug or inspect obfuscated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">compiled JavaScript code, it can actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">tell you the original line of code that it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">came from in your source language before you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">messed with it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="767">So this permits de-obfuscation of script, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">but it allows GWT, more importantly, to construct </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">perfectly accurate stack traces. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="772">So right now today if the user encounters </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">like an exception in one of the GWT applications, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">you get the line number of the method, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">name of the method that it occurred in, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">you actually don't actually get the actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">line number of code within the method that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">it occurred on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="789">And in fact, if the compiler has inline several </span><span class="line" data-startTime="789">methods and rolled them up into one, you actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">don't even know what method it occurred in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">because now those small inline methods are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">not even on the call stack. They've been basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">moved in to the parent caller. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="804">Not so with source maps. Now you will actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">know the exact original function, regardless </span><span class="line" data-startTime="809">of optimizations, where the error occurred. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="809">It's Chrome only for now. Firefox has demoed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">it and they promise to support it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="813">Okay. So this kind of dovetails into super </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">dev mode because it's what enables it. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">here's the problem. Over the years people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">have complained we haven't kept our dev mode, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">C++ plug-ins up to date. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="831">Basically we use these native plug-ins that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">we install into the browser so that when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="834">run in dev mode and it's running Java code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="834">and it has to remote control the browser and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="839">tell the browser add a DOM element somewhere, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="839">it talks to this plug-in, which then remotes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="844">controls the browser to actually update the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="844">browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="846">The problem is that the browser vendors have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="846">accelerated their iteration on their browser. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="853">Used to be they would release a browser once </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">a year, Firefox 4, 5, it would take a year. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="857">That would give the GWT team more than enough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">time to actually update three or four different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="861">plug-ins on three or four different operating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="861">systems. But now we simply can't handle it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">because every six weeks they're releasing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">a new version. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="868">Like, for example, every time Firefox releases </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">a new version of Firefox it breaks the C++ </span><span class="line" data-startTime="875">plug-ins that we have. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="875">So we needed a new solution. Plus on things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">like mobile devices like iOS you can't even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">have plug-ins in the browser, so how would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">you debug a GWT application on an iPad? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">So what if we could create a GWT compiler </span><span class="line" data-startTime="890">that was so fast we could compile your Java </span><span class="line" data-startTime="890">code in one second? Biggest complaint we get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">is the compiler is slow. So what if we could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">speed it up so we could compile your code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">in one second or 10 seconds? Then you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">actually iterate by loading up JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">into their browser. And with the combination </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">of source maps, you actually could debug source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="908">level Java code right in your browser. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="908">So let me show you a demo of that. So I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="918">got the GWT code server running, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="918">the new super dev mode server. It's a servlet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="923">It starts up on your GWT module and basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">it's waiting there for me to connect. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="926">going to serve up the compiled code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="926">So I'm going to go to this application I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="931">called Silver Comet, and hopefully I've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="931">a network connection and it can load up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="945">I might be in trouble here. If that doesn't, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="945">what I'll do is I have another version. Here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">let's do this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="962">I'll just skip ahead for a second and I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="968">come back to that and show it to you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="968">All right. Let's let that go for a second. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="975">Okay. There it is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="975">So this is an application, it's graphing marathon </span><span class="line" data-startTime="978">data from the Silver Comet half-marathon in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="978">Atlanta. You can see I can do things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">I can hit a character, click on a person, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">it tells me where the runner is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="988">If I were to try to debug this today, I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">bring up the Chrome inspector and I go to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="997">scripts. You can see that it's basically compiled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="997">JavaScript. So it would be really hard to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">like set a break point in here and debug it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1003">So let's go down to here and click on this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">little &mdash; in the Chrome inspector this little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">gearbox and say enable source maps. So now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">I'm going to click this &mdash; I'm going to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">back to the code server and I'm going to drag </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1020">this bookmarklet up here and I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1020">turn on super dev mode. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1026">So hopefully it's going to reload. I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">my network is having problems. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1035">Okay. There it is. I'm going to click super </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1035">dev mode, click compile. And it's compiling. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1049">And usually this takes like less than two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1049">seconds, but network is loading already, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1054">it's already finished, but it's loading on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1054">the bottom. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1055">There we go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1055">Now it's reloading the compiled JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1062">It's already been compiled at this point. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1062">I go over to this window over here and I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">probably show you compiled in 0.979 seconds, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">if you can see that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1073">So the issue is there is some kind of network </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1073">thing that's hurting my demo here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1078">Let me bring up the inspector and see if I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1078">can show this to you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1085">Oh, there it is. So it's back up. I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">to go to the scripts tag now, scripts. Now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1097">you can see I have Java code in here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1097">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1102"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: And I promise you it won't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1102">take this long when you actually do it on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1108">your own computer. I'm going to go and I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1108">set a break point here. See that? And I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">come up here and hit a character and you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">see it doing a break point. I can hit play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">and you see the things up there? So I'm stepping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">through Java code. In fact, you can do something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1119">in super dev mode that you could never do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1119">in regular dev mode. I'm going to step down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">into a JSNI function. I'm going to step into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">this item shell, step into remove property, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1130">JSNI JavaScript function. You could never </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1130">do that before in regular dev mode. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1137">[Applause]. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1137">So let's go back to slides. Okay. UI binder. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1148">If you use UI binder we have more good news </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1148">for you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1150">First of all, if you sell widgets, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">now actually &mdash; you don't have to write Java </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">code, you can actually specify the template </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">for a cell that renders in a table grid or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">in a tree with a UI binder template. There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">sort of a new interface called UI render and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1168">it does that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1168">Secondly, we have optimized the way UI binder </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1171">constructs the HTML and injects into the page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1171">significantly. We have vastly reduced the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">number of DOM operations down to just a few. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1176">The end result of that is start-up latency </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1182">for Orchid, which also uses GWT was reduced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1182">by 20%, and the rendering speed it was taking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">to refresh the HTML on the page went up by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">300%. So not just the compiler has been improved, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1193">but the speed of the widgets has been improved </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1193">up to 300%. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">And we've also started the beginnings of adding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">support for using the same I 18 and message </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">class used on the client side in the server. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1206">So using GWT.create in the server, and what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">that will get to is sometimes you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">share code between the client server in terms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">of internationalization resource bundles, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">this will basically get you there eventually. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1222">And we have updated the ARIA library support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1222">in the GWT to the newest W3C standard. If </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1227">you have accessibility concerns, we have better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1227">support for that. Lastly, we're introducing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">a new experimental library called Elemental. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1237">So what is Elemental? Well, over the years, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1246">as I said, the browser vendors are iterating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1246">faster and faster, every week they are adding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1250">a new HTML5 API into JavaScript. And we just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1250">can't keep up hand wrapping those APIs, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1257">every release, GWT 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, we added </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1257">a few. We added canvas and then we added local </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">storage, an index database, so on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1263">But there's just too many. We can't keep it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">up as a manual process. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">So what Elemental is, it's a library that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">builds a complete 100% HTML5 mapping to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">latest Chrome, WebKit and soon Firefox, by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1281">actually looking at the C++ source code definitions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1281">for the JavaScript run times used for exporting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">their APIs and auto generating a complete </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">set of GWT classes that directly call into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1294">those APIs, look, it's all done &mdash; I've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1294">a typo in there &mdash; with JavaScript overlay </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">type. So when you compile this, they all melt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">away, it's a small or smaller than you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1304">write by hand. There's no overhead. Every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1304">API you could think of is there, WebGL, Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1309">audio sockets, RTC, even Web Intents, Shadow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1309">DOM, these new things that you might have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">just seen at the show today. We have a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">set of collection classes that you can use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">as an alternative to JavaScript util collections </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">that are mapped directly to underline JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">collections, so there's no overhead if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">use like maps or arrays, no extra bloat. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1330">a new JSON library, similarly that has no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1330">overhead if you use it, just directly access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1335">JSON objects and no bloat in the output. I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1335">think this is an excellent library for doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">mobile device development because the mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">device browsers are often on the bleeding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1346">edge of CSS3 and things like that because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1346">that's how they get their extra performance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1351">So it could also work for desktop. But you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1351">might have the &mdash; already using the existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1357">stuff, so you will have to decide whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1357">or not you want to move over to this library. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1360">But try it out. I'm going to show you a demo. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1360">Real quick. And I cooked up sort of a hack </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1369">to show you the power of super dev mode and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1369">to show the power of Elemental. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1374">And so what I have done is I've built this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1374">servlet filter that if you try to load up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1379">an HTML page and if you have something in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1379">there like this ... I'm going to type a script </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1384">tag. I'm going to say type the SQL to text/ </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1384">&mdash; no, not JavaScript, Java. And in here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1394">I'm just going to write like I would write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1394">JavaScript. Window.alert. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1398">Hello. Believe it or not, that's Java code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">not JavaScript. So I have a servlet filter, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1406">when this file is being piped out will catch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1406">that script tag and see well, that's Java </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1410">code, automatically synthesize a GWT module </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1410">entry point on the fly, right into the super </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">dev mode compiler, compile it in one second, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">then replace it back with a regular script </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1420">type, text JavaScript, and then the page loads. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1420">And so &mdash; so my computer is kind of slow on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1426">a real computer &mdash; if I would upgrade my computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1426">it would run a lot faster, but I will show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">you that right now. Let's see &mdash; if I just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">write some code there, and it's &mdash; oops. Wait. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1445">Okay. Is it running? It is running. Okay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1445">Demo problems again. Oh, that's because it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1451">on my local machine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1451">That would make all difference okay. Let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">let that load. There you go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1457">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1460"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: So now you can develop &mdash; if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1460">I were to release this servlet filter, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1466">can actually develop Java code in a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1466">lightweight fashion, where you can have multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">HTML pages and just sprinkle a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">of Java code in each page a page at a time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1474">and just get a little tiny bit of compiled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1474">Java code out of it. Well, why would you do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1479">that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1479">Well, simple. Any of you know by heart the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1482">new Web RTC camera API? I sure don't. There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1482">a lot of APIs in HTML5. But because this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1489">Java, this is my Java IDE, you know, I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1489">do things like this, you know, window &mdash; this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">is the Elemental library &mdash; .getnavigator </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">or .get &mdash; you see all of these APIs in geolocation, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1502">platform plug-ins, product, I can do WebKitgetusermedia, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1502">which is the new Web RTC API to access the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1508">camera. </span></p>

So as more and more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1562">internal Google apps migrated to GWT, we could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1562">not take much of a chance accepting patches </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">without thoroughly reviewing them. Imagine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">somebody submits a patch and it puts a bug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">into ad words, we could lose billions of dollars </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">of revenue. So we have to be really careful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">about accepting external community patches. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1579">So you might have noticed a lot of frustration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">with the issue tracker because we had our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">internal issue tracker, and we were proprietary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1589">to internal bugs. Hundreds of internal GWT </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1589">apps, you know, our internal customers come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1593">first, compared to the community because that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1593">where our money is coming from. And so &mdash; so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">I thought that was a really sorry situation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">to be in because a lot of the people in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1602">community have contributed so much to GWT </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1602">over the years and we really needed to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">them better. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">And so I suggested and we adopted that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1612">going to basically change the governor &mdash; governing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1612">body of GWT to no longer just be Google as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">a dictator, but be as a peer. So we're introducing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">the GWT steering committee. So now the control </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1626">over the future roadmap of GWT, when features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1626">go into it, who gets to be a committer, who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1631">is a code reviewer, what patches get landed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1631">is now going to be controlled by a committee </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1635">of several of the top, you know, star contributors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1635">to the GWT community and some of the biggest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1640">companies using GWT. Google goes from being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1640">now a gatekeeper to a peer amongst equals. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1646">So we have to be more responsive, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">to think more about what other people are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">using GWT for, not only what we are using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">it for. The steering committee is going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">determine what the project guidelines are, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">what the policies and philosophies of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">project is going forward and determine who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">gets direct commit access to the master branch. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1661">And it's going to set the overall future roadmap </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1661">as I said. We have drawn from a mix of star </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1665">contributors, and here they are. This is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1665">initial GWT steering committee. It's Google, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">Vaadin, Sencha, Red Hat, Thomas Broyer, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">Stephan Haberman, who have done an enormous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">number of bug fixes to GWT over the years. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">Daniel Kurka, who has done an absolutely awesome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1681">mobile GWT library, and Christian Goudreau </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1681">of Arcbees, who has done the GWT team library </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1686">which a lot of people use because it extends </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1686">our MVP library, it's really fabulous. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1690">We've had some early decisions. We've had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">a couple of meetings already. We've decided, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1695">this might please many of you, we're moving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1695">the DMT repository from Subversion to Git. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1700">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1700"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: And we're going to have two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">official branches now. The master dev line </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">trunk, where all of you if you have a feature, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1712">you can submit your patch, and it can land, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1712">whether or not it may break an internal GWT </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">application. This will be the bleeding edge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">branch. Everyone when you get a nightly build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">one and try it out, we can figure out what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">needs to be rolled back. But if it makes it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1724">through the dev branch and doesn't destroy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1724">anybody's applications, then it's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1729">be cherry picked into the beta branch, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1729">represents the work on the next release, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1733">say GWT 2.6 or GWT 3.0. The beta release is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1733">what Google is going to be building our internal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1739">apps off of. So there's going to be a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1739">of quality assurance on that branch so you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">can be sure if you want to pick up something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">that's a little more stable, you can be trusting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">in, that would be beta branch. Our partners </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">like Sencha and Vaadin will probably also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">be shipping code based off of beta branch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">works, not the dev link. So you will have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">a much lower probability of breakage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1759">So here's where you will find us, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">going to be a new website, not up yet. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">google.com/gwtsteering. You can read about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">all of the new rules, processes for contributing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">to the GWT. And there's a GWT steering mailing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">list where you can read our meeting minutes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">and our discussions on what's happening with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1776">the future of GWT and where it's going. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1776">you won't to wait ages for a blog post from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">us to see what's happening. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">Now you can read it in real-time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1785">So now I would like to ask Michael Mullany, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">CEO of Sencha, to talk about all of the brave </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">and exciting things that they're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">do with GWT now and in the future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1794">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1815"><span class="speakerName">Michael Mullany</span>: Okay. So before we start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1819">just a quick poll. How many people have developed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1819">with GWT, since you're in the GWT session, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">right? Good. How many people have done an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">app over 10,000 lines? 50,000 lines? 100,000 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">lines? Half a million lines? Over a million </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">lines of code? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">Okay. That's a good distribution. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1835">Well, one of the reasons that we are excited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1841">about GWT is because it does really help you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1841">with very large applications and very large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1844">teams working together. We are a company that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1844">has about 2 million worldwide developers in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">JavaScript and in Java. Across all sorts of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">applications and all sorts of geographies. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1858">Of that, we have about 400,000 registered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1858">community members on an incredibly active </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">forum, so we're approaching kind of a million </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1862">posts on our forums over time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1866">We're also expanding geographically pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">rapidly. We started on the East Coast, moved </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1873">to California, we just opened a Vancouver </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1873">office and an Amsterdam office. I'm not allowed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1878">to say we're hiring, so I won't say that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1878">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1881"><span class="speakerName">Michael Mullany</span>: We have a really amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">array of applications built with Sencha Technologies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1889">with XGS, with Sencha Touch and with GWT. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1889">We have everything from very large clinical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">trials management applications to CAs, admin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">interfaces to Dell's warehouse management </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1902">system, Best Buy's store system, all built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1902">with Sencha technologies. We're primarily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">focused on business applications and very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">large applications. That's why people use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1912">a very structured framework, like XGS or GWT. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1912">And our goal is to take &mdash; to really provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1920">a complete productivity capability from design </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1920">time to development run, all the way to deployment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1927">So Sencha architect, if you stopped by our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1927">sandbox yesterday, is a drag and drop visual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1933">app builder for Sencha Touch and XGS so you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1933">can get mobile and desktop on the same tool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1938">We are also happy to be working on GWT designer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1938">integration for GXT. Sencha (indiscernible) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1946">is focused on content animations. The build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1946">side JavaScript frameworks for mobile and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1951">desktop and we have GXT for Java. Our deployment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1951">is the newest thing that we have. It's cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">services that basically provide back end point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">services like notifications, authentications, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">app messaging for mobile and desktop applications. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">Our goal, and I think this is a common thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1970">across developer bases today, is to as much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1970">as possible provide a single HTML platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1976">across all of these &mdash; in the multi-device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1976">world, right? So from phones to tablets to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1982">TVs to desktops, people are trying to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1982">application experiences that follow you from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">device to device, that reuse data, reuse models, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">reuse business logic, controller logic as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">much as possible and that's really our design </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">point for Sencha Technologies, whether in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">JavaScript or in Java. XGS 4 is our JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">framework, I won't spend much time on it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2005">It basically provides structure for JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">programmers who want to create large applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2012">that are pixel perfect across browser. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2012">companion to that is that Sencha Touch, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">is again a JavaScript framework for modern </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">mobile devices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2021">We made a bet that smart phones were the only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2021">phones that smarted and that turned out that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">was the case. We do an awful lot of low level </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">platform code switching abstraction to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2031">the code base work across every device that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2031">you can think of. I mentioned architect and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2037">IL. So on to Sencha GXT, which is a meet for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2037">this room. GXT started about five years ago </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2046">as the &mdash; as Darrell's project and then Darrell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2046">joined Sencha and merged with the Sencha team. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2054">It's basically fully featured, theme-able, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2054">high performance widgets. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2058">It's a true GWT implementation, even more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2058">so in GXT 3 than was the case in GXT 2. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">big thing that GXT brings to the table is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">full alignment with GWT conventions in GXT </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2072">3. But really the thing that knocks you on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2072">the head when you look at GXT is just the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2077">sheer volume and weight of UI widgets that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2077">we bring to the table that you don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2083">to create yourself. There's &mdash; there's literally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2083">several hundred widgets of all types for all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">types of applications that work the way that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">GXT or GWT expects. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2095">So GXT we just completed an enormous release, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2095">our GXT release. It was just released about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">six or eight weeks ago. It basically takes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">what we had built ourselves from our own custom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2110">conventions for things like event handling, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2110">all into GWT 2.1 through 2.3 conventions. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2119">So, for example, we now use the cells to render </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2119">our trees and our grids and it's much, much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2128">faster and much, much lighter weight. We have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2128">also moved to interface-based design, so for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">large applications it's much easier to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">mocks and to do testing. We've done &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2138">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2138"><span class="speakerName">Michael Mullany</span>: Thank you. Custom theming, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2143">so we now use the appearance pattern. We've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2143">pulled out theming information out of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2146">components and out of widgets, so it's much, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2146">much easier to add raw HTML and CSS styling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">into your components without standing on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">head. We also have much improved model support. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2158">So in &mdash; in GXT 2, you basically have to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">our custom data stores and that was the only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">way of getting data into an application again </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">without standing on your head. Now you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">basically pull in &mdash; pull in model data from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">plain Java objects or for any beans that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">have. Much more flexible. We also added full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">UI binder support so you can declare your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2184">UI widgets with the UI binder XML conventions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2184">Another thing, strongly type layout engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2193">One of the big issues with our layouts in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">GXT 2 was that you could basically have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2201">lot of mismatches between a container type </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2201">and a layout. So now we've gone to strongly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">typed layouts, so it's much harder to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">a mistake and the compiler will catch it if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2210">you try and associate a layout with a container </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2210">that doesn't match it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2216">And there's a lot of other things in the release, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2216">but basically the whole theme was have a huge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2224">widget library and theming that works with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2224">the new GWT conventions and I think we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2232">been pretty successful with that. It's had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2232">a great response and a great reception in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2236">the short weeks that we've released it. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2236">we're really happy to have released it. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">we're actually incredibly excited about this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">opening up of GWT with the steering committee. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2250">One of the main reasons that we ended it with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2250">custom conventions in GXT 2 was the fact that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2256">we had no idea what was coming down the road </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2256">from the GWT team. So we had our own event </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">system and I think it was literally a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">of months afterwards there was a new event </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2265">system from GWT that if we had known was coming, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2265">we probably would have aligned with. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2271">So we're really happy to continue to promote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2271">RIA for Java developers. We're really excited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2276">to be a member of the steering committee. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2276">We would love to hear you, as a member of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">the steering committee, your ideas for how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">we can improve GWT going forward. GWT we feel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2287">is the best way for organizations that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2287">committed to Java to build front end applications, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2292">particularly larger ones, larger teams, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2292">what our customer base tells us why GWT is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">an awesome solution for them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2298">So what are we doing? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2304">We've just finished our GXT release, so it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2304">was pretty huge. We're just getting around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">to planning the next release. But a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">of things we're doing is making the appearance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2314">implementation that we have better with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2314">more flexible client bundle, we are doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2319">some updates to UI binder, and I think some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2319">of our changes have actually made it into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323">the 2.5 code base. Theme building. You know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323">it's actually a huge request across our product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2331">line, which is how can we do better visual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2331">design without having to hack into SASS or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">hack into custom CSS. Better IDE support and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">tooling. So there's some support coming in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2344">GWT designer for GXT 3. But our goal is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2344">make it easier and easier to create GXT applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2351">using standard Eclipse and stand IDEs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2351">There's much, much more detail into what we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2359">put into GXT 3, we're really proud of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2359">release. Probably the best place to learn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2363">more about it is on our blog, that's the link. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2363">Just Sencha-GXT from our blog. Also Darrell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2373">and myself will be here hanging around after </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2373">the session if you want to talk to us more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2376">about GXT. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2376">We're really excited about the directions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2380">we're really honored that Google has asked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2380">us to participate in the steering committee, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2384">and we hope to be able to serve the GWT community </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2384">as best we can in this new role. So thanks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2390">again. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2390">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2393"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: I would like to ask Joonas </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2393">Lehtinen to come up. He's the C.E.O. of Vaadin, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2403">which he has a fabulous framework. He's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2403">to tell you all how Vaadin is going to contribute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2410">to GWT and what they're all about. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2410"><span class="speakerName">Joonas Lehtinen</span>: Yeah, I'm really excited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2420">to be here and see where GWT is going at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2420">moment. Let's first kind of give a brief intro </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">to (indiscernible) how we are using GWT and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">where that relationship is going in the future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2434">So you can say that Vaadin is a Java frame </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2434">building rich web applications, and as that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2441">it's quite like GWT, but at the same time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2441">it's different from GWT; in Vaadin you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2446">doing everything from the server side. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2446">basically based on three different items. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2451">So first we want to have amazing components, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2451">both as URL components as well as data sources </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2458">and data (indiscernible) themes and so on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2458">So we have really nice set of widgets in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2465">core product, hundred or so widgets, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2465">go to vaadin.com/demo to see that out. There </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2473">are also widgets for mobile, Android, iPhone, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2473">iPad. What I'm mostly excited about is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2479">community around Vaadin, so there are hundreds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2479">of plug-ins in for Vaadin. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2483">Those plug-ins might be widget outbreaks or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2483">integrations or themes or tools. Second idea </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2491">is that they're combining server side RIA </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2491">together with (inaudible) so what is this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2497">search? Look at this, so basically you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2497">five layers in your (inaudible), so you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2503">the back end layer and the Web server. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2503">have communications. And you're going to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2509">Java to Java compiler, and then Java to Java </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2509">within Web browser, so if you look at GWT, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2515">it looks like this, so this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2515">(indiscernible) four layers, and optionally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2520">you can do on JavaScript on top of that. Vaadin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2520">is quite different. You are only writing two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2526">layers. You're only writing code on the server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2526">side, so everything on the (indiscernible) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2531">layer and on the browser side is total automatic. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2531">You don't have to write any line of code for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2536">those. And if you're converting this to Java </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2536">frameworks, I like XJS, it's probably the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2542">best one out there at the moment. So also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2542">in here you're writing four layers, and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2548">is the core of the (indiscernible) you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2548">kind of skip half &mdash; half of your program </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2555">when you're writing in Vaadin. It actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2555">works like this. So all of the components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2560">have two parts. You have server side component, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2560">it's basically API that your program is against, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2565">so whole UI is on the server side. On the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2565">client side, you are rendering and event handling, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2572">and that part is totally done with Web toolkit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2572">(indiscernible) Third thing, Java, basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">everything in Vaadin is (indiscernible) object, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">so all of the components are plain ole objects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2588">just running on the server side in the real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2588">JVM. (indiscernible) you can write UI in any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2595">language out there. You can use (indiscernible) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2595">what have you. You can use any tooling, any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2602">IDs. You can deploy this to almost any server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2602">out there, most of the clouds, and at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2610">end of the day, it's just one file, so you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2610">can use that in any web browser. Just drop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2613">that (indiscernible) into a project, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2613">start adding UIs with that. It's (indiscernible) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2621">license so it should be the same license as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2621">GWT. So what's the relation between Vaadin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2626">and GWT? Let's look at the history. This is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2626">actually quite an old project. We started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2631">in 2001 already. So we've had 11 years of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2631">history behind us. And then we kind of started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2638">to have huge number of JavaScript code lines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2638">on the client side to render all of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2643">components, and it turned out to be not that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2643">nice, so fortunately GWT came along and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2650">threw all of that away and we wrote everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2650">in GWT. (indiscernible) It was a perfect fit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2657">to Vaadin. Both are written in Java. Both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2657">(indiscernible) oriented and both recorded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2664">across browsers, something very important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2664">for us. So I could say that this has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2669">kind of like standing on the shoulder of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2669">giant, this giant being Google and (indiscernible) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2674">you have been doing a really, really excellent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2674">job, and it has been helping to write quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2680">a bit, so we haven't had to deal with all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2680">the browser differences ourself. So you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2686">see this as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2686">our engagement period of five years for us, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2689">and this has been strange engagement because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2689">after five years, we are still in love with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2696">GWT. I truly think that GWT is the best way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2696">of building Web scripts, Web application on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2702">the client side with Java. So if you're building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2702">a huge application, there is &mdash; that's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2707">kind of number one way of doing that on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2707">client side. But the relationship have been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2713">kind of unidirectional. We have been getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2713">a lot from GWT. And we haven't been giving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2719">too much back. And I think this is the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2719">for many of us, so we have been using GWT, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2725">we haven't been giving too much back to GWT. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2725">And I'm really thrilled to see this new development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2731">with the steering committee and more open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2731">process for GWT, so we can come back to GWT, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2738">and I hope in the end this grows to be something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2738">much, much, much bigger than it is today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2745">So where do we go next? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2745">You have been kind of jumping in five year </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2751">leaps. What's the next leap for us? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2751">So I'm really thrilled to announce the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2756">study for Vaadin. We are adding GWT to Vaadin. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2756">So what does it mean? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2763">At the moment we are kind of using GWT as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2763">a dependents. We are using GWT as a rendering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2768">agent behind the scenes in Vaadin. What they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2768">are doing, they are moving inside Vaadin, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2774">so they're taking copy, putting that inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2774">Vaadin and maintaining ourselves </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2777">(indiscernible) and we, of course, are contributing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2777">all of those back to GWT. This also means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2788">that Vaadin will be combined with GWT. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2788">for two days project you can use Vaadin for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2795">that, and as a win developer, a new customer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2795">what's more in there? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2799">There are a couple of things. But first, there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2799">are actually two sides of Vaadin. So we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2806">two program modules. We have server side programming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2806">and we have client side programming. Server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2810">side being optimized for the productivity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2810">and the client side being optimized for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2815">controlling. So you get both around 50 reduction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2815">of code lines when you're programming in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2824">server side as well as all of the wonderful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2824">controller on the platform on the client side. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2830">So you can see that from the developer point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2830">of view we are adding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2834">(indiscernible) components, tools, themes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2834">but also there's one more theme. (indiscernible) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2842">support, we are serving companies who are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2842">using our technology to build applications, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2849">and now that we are merging GWT in the Vaadin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2849">directly, we are starting the support with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2855">Vaadin. If (indiscernible) we are a good project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2855">for you. This is going to be available pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2865">soon now. So we are targeting for the Java </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2865">1 release with Vaadin 7 that will be including </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2873">GWT, and it's available as a developer preview </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2873">today. This is an early alpha release, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2881">it's there for you to try out. There is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2881">ton of more things to read about how Vaadin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2887">would kind of combine and what that old aspect, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2887">(indiscernible) and read more about this. </span></p>

Okay. So there were a couple of other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2915">steering committee members who couldn't be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2915">here, I don't want to spend too much time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2918">But Christian Goudreau has developed a wonderful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2918">library called GWT, and he is on the steering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2925">committee as well, and he has some wonderful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2925">things to say, and I'll just leave that up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2929">there for a second for posterity. As well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2929">as Daniel Kurka who has done an incredible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2935">mobile library for web property (indiscernible) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2935">I encourage you to go to n-gwt.com, check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2939">it out.

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2939">I'm sure he's going to be focused on making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2944">GWT better for mobile.

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2975"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi. So my first question is about validation. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2975">You said you've implemented the 303 at 2010, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2982">but as for now, our classes in package validation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2982">are marked as experimental, and they say do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2992">not use them in production. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2992"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: Yes. I'll answer very quickly. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2996">We have recently hired someone to specifically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2996">work on the support in GWT and to make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3002">100% compatible with the 303 TCK test compatibility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3002">kit. So if you look at the event logs right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3009">now, you'll see a new guy who is committing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3009">&mdash; or actually one by one he's fixing the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3014">TCK test, and once they pass the TCK, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3014">we'll remove the experimental tag. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3019"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, thanks. When will 2.5 be released? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3019"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: RC1 is out already. You can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3026">download it now. Probably in maybe a week </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3026">or two, the final version, after we get some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3031">bug reports back and smoke test it more. Okay. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3031">Thank you. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3034">I'll go over to this one. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3034"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi, I'm a GIS developer, I use Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3039">maps to do &mdash; in my projects. Most of &mdash; I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3039">hate JavaScript. Most of the time I'm looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3047">for a GWT wrappers around Google maps API. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3047">Are you guys coordinating between the two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3057">teams to always have a GWT library for Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3057">maps once a new version of Google maps API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3063">comes out? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3063"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: Yeah, a good question. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3066">yes, in the past, we have done that, I believe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3066">recently they may have released an update </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3070">to the Google API libraries for GWT which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3070">included some support I think for 3.0. I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3077">know what state it's in. Unfortunately, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3077">person who is working on it, Eric Zundel, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3084">left to go to another company, but we will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3084">try to figure out a solution for that. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3090">may be that the steering committee takes it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3090">over, like for example, maybe Sencha with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3093">some maps, widgets in there, and they can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3093">basically take on the task of ensuring it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3098">always up to date. But we'll find out. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3098">are definitely concerned about it, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3103">maps are actually very important. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3107"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hello. (saying name). I'm a new developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3107">and our team is mostly &mdash; we are mostly using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3114">intelliJ to develop and to debug our applications, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3114">and the question is with the new super dev </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3120">mode, will we be able to use our favorite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3120">IDE to debug applications, or the only way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3127">to do it will be the browser? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3127"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: Right. Good question. As you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3130">can see. I am a rabid intelliJ user, I love </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3130">intelliJ, and I constantly rag on people at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3137">Google that use eclipse. The answer is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3137">we are trying to talk to JetBrains, they've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3144">done a lot of good support in the past to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3144">basically get support for source maps within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3149">intelliJ, and based on the outcome of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3149">talks, if they're willing to do it, if source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3154">maps are implemented or if we had a plug-in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3154">to do it for intelliJ, intelliJ can already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3160">attach to JavaScript debuggers, so essentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3160">instead of attaching it to JVM, you attach </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3164">it to the Chrome debugger, and all it has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3164">to do is use the map to actually let you match </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3168">it back into the editor, breakpoint intelliJ </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3168">to control Chrome. It definitely is a possibility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3175">to make that work, and we need to talk to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3175">the right people and make it happen. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3181"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi, I have two questions, actually. First </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3181">about the steering committee. I'm very happy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3186">to see that Google is accepting more external </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3186">people, but I'm also a little bit concerned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3195">because there are a lot of companies that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3195">have large libraries on the steering committee. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3204">How do you guaranty that &mdash; these companies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3204">have their own agenda. How do you guaranty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3210">that GWT doesn't become bloated with their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3210">features that &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3217"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: I can answer that. First thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3217">is that when we initially nominated them, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3223">we told them that we realize that they have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3223">commercial interests, but we would like steering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3227">committee members to also kind of wear the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3227">GWT hat. So, for example, we're on the GCC </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3233">committee, I think, you know, Google participated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3233">with GCC development, and of course people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3238">on the GCC steering committee, they're all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3238">commercial companies or different chip, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3242">know, like AMD or Intel or whatever, so they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3242">have interest, but the people on the committee </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3246">usually do a pretty good job of wearing their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3246">GCC hats, and we expect that the GWT community </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3252">members kind of wear their GWT hats so that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3252">they have things that are competitive, they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3257">probably going to keep them anyway, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3257">that's their value, but if there's new core </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3262">features they need, like new event handlers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3262">or new support for low level operations or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3268">there's bug fixes that they have been forking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3268">off privately in the past to fix, now they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3273">will contribute them back. The second thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3273">is that the committee is run by consensus, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3277">so if anyone objects, basically, to a proposal, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3277">it doesn't happen. So we basically all have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3283">to agree, and some people on the committee </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3283">will be concerned about bloat, and if, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3287">know, someone wants to drop in like a two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3287">megabyte JavaScript library, there is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3290">to be some objections. Is that &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3290"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I have a question about the example you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3297">showed with injecting Java code inside the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3297">HTML page, so you type window from lower case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3303">W, it's not class window. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3303"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: That's right. So &mdash; yeah, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3310">so the intelliJ is actually a really fabulous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3310">IDE, (indiscernible) so I told intelliJ to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3317">assume that there's a line in the code that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3317">looks like this, window window is equal to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3322">browser dot get window, and so that is like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3322">implied that's there, and what happens is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3330">the filter, when it's extracting that code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3330">and writing it to disc, it inserts that line, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3335">so the IDE doesn't complain that that window </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3335">variable is missing because I told intelliJ </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3340">to assume that that's injected. So that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3340">a feature of intelliJ, so if you're an eclipse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3344">user, you might want to check that out. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3344">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3348"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: Okay. Let me go to him first. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3348"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So another question I wanted to ask is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3356">about kind of release for GWT, what are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3356">next versions when they will be out and what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3363">features are planned so probably this question </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3363">must go to your committee and what will be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3367">the process? Who will decide? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3367"><span class="speakerName">Ray Cromwell</span>: Right. Excellent question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3371">And, yes, I should have basically made it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3371">clear that 2.5 will actually be the last official </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3378">Google controlled release. Every new release, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3378">GWT 2.6 or GWT 3.0, will now be basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3384">a steering committee release, and so the road </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3384">map, we haven't &mdash; we've just started our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3389">first two or three steering committee meetings. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3389">We got basic IP issues, and things like that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3394">We're getting to starting to find a road map, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3394">where are we going to go, go to GitHub or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3400">somewhere else, there's lots of arguments </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3400">in the base over that kind of stuff (indiscernible) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3406">and so one thing we're going to discuss is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3406">what's going to go into the next version and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3410">when is it going to be released. So if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3410">watch GWT steering &mdash; GWT.steering at Google.com, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3415">you can follow along and probably get some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3415">inkling as to when it's going to happen. Probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3423">sooner. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3423">Okay. Any last questions? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3426">All right. Well, thanks for coming, guys, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3426">and I hope you continue to join GWT. </span></p></div>
