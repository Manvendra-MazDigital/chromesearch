<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/J7Q0a_Fz1Kg">youtu.be/J7Q0a_Fz1Kg</a><div id="transcript"><p><span class="line" data-startTime="3">Hi! My name is Brad and I am one of the Tech </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3">Leads for Native Client. In this video, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">am going to dive into the technology that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">makes Native Client apps possible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="14">A key concept in Native Client is the sandbox, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">an isolation technique that prevents downloaded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">code from doing things it’s not supposed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">to. The Native Client sandbox prevents application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">code from interacting directly with the native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">operating system. This is crucial for portability. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="32">If an app invoked the native OS directly, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">it couldn’t run on other operating systems. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="37">It’s also essential for security, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">the native operating system provides access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">to resources like your files that need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">be protected. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="47">The Native Client sandbox is implemented using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">a technique called Software Fault Isolation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="53">This technique was first introduced in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">early 90’s. It’s based on the use of assembly-language </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">idioms that are easy to recognize and that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">when used, make it possible to prove certain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">things about the program’s behavior. For </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">example, if you insure that all data addresses </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">used by a program are greater than a particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">address, then you know that no memory references </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">can happen below that address. Using software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">fault isolation we implement what we call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">reliable disassembly. This means that we know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">every instruction a program can execute, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">won’t run it unless we can prove that each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">instruction is safe. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="93">Defense in depth is another key concept for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">Native Client. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="97">Suppose you had a brick of gold. You might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">put it in a safe, but you wouldn’t leave </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">that safe sitting out in your front yard. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="102">Maybe you’d put it inside your house, maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">even in a locked room, and you would probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">lock your house too. In the same way, Native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">Client uses multiple layers of protection </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">that make it much harder to attack the system. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="120">We also apply best practices such as strict </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">coding standards and multiple internal and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">external security reviews to insure that our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">system is really safe. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="131">Openness is another key principle we’ve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">applied in this system. We’ve built the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">system around established open standards like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">HTML5, C, C++, POSIX and ELF, to make it easily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">accessible to a large community of developers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="144">We’ve open-sourced our system, because we’ve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">seen that scrutiny and input from the developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">community makes our system better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="155">I hope you’ve enjoyed this quick overview </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">of some of the principles behind Native Client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">technology.
