<p><span class="line" data-startTime="0"> KURZKE: Thanks everyone for coming for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">our session. I've been told if you want, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="6">can rearrange the chairs a little bit to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="6">it more comfortable for you to actually see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">the stage. This one is more of a presentation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="9">It's not as much as hands-on lab. So, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">don't really need your laptop if you can go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">with &mdash; like an hour without checking email. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="20">I know it's hard to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="20"> SAXMAN: No chance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="23"> KURZKE: I know. So, thanks everyone. Welcome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">to our talk about Google TV and we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">to talk about the current version of Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">TV. Myself, I am Christian Kurzke. I am the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">developer advocate for the Android platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">on Google TV. I joined the team about a year </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">ago and I've been working with the preloaded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">Android applications, so, the Napster, Pandora, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">Twitter Apps, all the good stuff that's on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">your TV today. And with me is Paul. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="53"> SAXMAN: My name is Paul Saxman and I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">relatively new to the Google TV Team. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">I have quite a bit of Android background. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="57">I built quite a few apps and I truly believe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">that Google TV is the new frontier for Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">app development. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="66"> KURZKE: We're the Wild West. So, what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">also have here is &mdash; let's see, hopefully we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">have a next slide. Yes. So, we have this thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">called Speaker Meter. We're going to use throughout </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">Google IO. You can give us live feedback to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">either on Twitter, I'm not going check it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">here but I will look at it later, or Speaker </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">Meter, this is for each session. You can just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">try and scan the QR code and give us feedback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">on it later. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="97"> SAXMAN: And we are going to have a Q&A </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">at the end. So &mdash; and actually, when &mdash; we do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">have that microphone up here for everybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">to use. So, feel free to line up near the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">end of the talk. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="106"> KURZKE: Okay. So actually, just to give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">a quick hand &mdash; show of hands. So, how many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">of you are actually Android developers and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">have developed Android apps? Awesome, very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">good. And how many Web developers do we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">here or people who are not so familiar? Good, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">good. So, hopefully, we'll try to keep it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">pretty high-level and pretty generic. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">we should have something for all of you. We'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">go a little bit into detail but here's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">overview. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="136"> SAXMAN: Yes. Yes. So, here's a breakdown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">of what Christian and I are going to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">about today. We're going to start off with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">an overview of the Google TV platform. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">then, start to talk about building native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">Android apps and Web apps, kind of at high-level. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="148">We're then going to talk a little bit about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">how you decide what to build because it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">kind of a tough question which direction you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">want to go sometimes. We're then going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">segue into building Android apps for Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">TV a little more deeper &mdash; deeply, covering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">how to get set up with the environment. Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">TV displays, types of apps and tips on navigation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">and layout, which are very pretty very important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="171">And finally, we'll be sure to keep some time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">at the end for Q&A. Since this is BootCamp </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">and there's a lot of news coming the next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">couple of days, today, we're going to focus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">on what Google TV is now and how you can start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">developing for the platform today but won't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">be talking about the next version of Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">TV yet. So, please keep in mind &mdash; keep that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">in mind during the Q&A. And, however, we do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">think that there's a lot of great information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">in this talk for developers interested in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">Google TV as the new platform for Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">development. So, without further ado, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">talk about the Google TV platform. So, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">is Google TV? Google TV is a platform that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">opens the living room to the Web, making television </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">more relevant and engaging. It accomplishes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">this by bringing together a sophisticated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">and open applications platform, which is Android, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">and a full HTML5 capable Web browser, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">is Chrome. And also, it brings all this together </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">with the power of search. Like, Android for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">mobile devices and tablets, it's one platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">for multiple devices. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="237"> KURZKE: So, from a little bit more of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">technical point of view, just also some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">the, you know, clarifying some of the conceptions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">that people have &mdash; so we really want to bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">internet content and interactive content together </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">with your existing TV content. So, Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">TV &mdash; sometimes in the press after the launch, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">there was this sort of connotation that it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">would replace your existing cable subscription. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="268">And it's really not the intention. So, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">are trying to bring new content together with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">your old content that you already have on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">your TV. So, most people, at least here in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">the US, sort of the standard set up is you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">have a satellite box or a cable box and your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">cable box connects to your TV and you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">a DVR and you have all really great set up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">with an audio system and everything. What </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">we want is we want Google TV, in this case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">here, I'm showing the logitech box integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">with your existing setup. It would sit between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">your cable box and your TV and it would bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">you additional content from the internet. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="304">So, you can &mdash; today already, you can have, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="304">on your Web browser, you can go to optimize &mdash; TV </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">optimized websites or you can run some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">the pre-installed Android applications. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">if you already have a Google TV, you can run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">the Pandora app, you can run Netflix app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">you can stream movies, and it brings it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">the largest display in your house, to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">TV. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="327"> SAXMAN: So, to &mdash; let's take a quick look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">at the history of Google TV to help understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">where it is today. It was announced just about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">a year ago at IO, and a few months after that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">the Sony and Logitech Google TV devices were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">available to the &mdash; or available on the market. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="342">Those devices are based on Android 2.1 and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">like Christian mentioned, they have several </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">Android applications preloaded. In December </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">of last year, the Android remote control app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">was released, which was received pretty well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="359">And in January of this year, we announced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">two new OEM partners, Samsung and Vizio. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">finally at this last March, we released an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">iPhone version of the remote app, which also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">is pretty highly received. So, looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">this timeline, something you should note is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">that Google TV is still a relatively young </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">platform. As with Android on mobile devices, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">we brought Google TV to the market quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">so that we can get user's feedback. And this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">year, we have collected a lot of great feedback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">and we are incorporating it into Google TV </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">so that it can become a great device. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="390"> KURZKE: And I think also what's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">interesting about Google TV is it will be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">an interesting platform for Android developers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">we have announced last year that we will bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">market and we will have the ability for developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">to develop applications for it. So, just look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">at it like the G1 device, it's still very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">early in the curve, but also earlier this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">year, as Paul mentioned in January, at CES, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">we announced two new hardware OEMs. So, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">going to be a large footprint of devices in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">the market. So, what is it from a user's point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">of view? One thing you always have to keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">in mind when you develop applications, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">is the context in which your application will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">be used. And I think what you have to keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">in mind is when you develop an app for Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">TV, sort of put yourself in the mindset of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">your user, it's like lean back on a couch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">in the living room after a long day at work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">with the remote control and probably a bag </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">of chips in the other hand. So, it's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">a different mindset than what your user has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">when they interact with your website. When </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">you're maybe, in the office, you're between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">meetings, you're checking a website, you're, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">I don't know, going to your favorite eCommerce </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">website or something. So, the TV is more of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">a leisure, more of an entertainment device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">and people spend a lot of time consuming content. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="474">So, what we really want to accomplish with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">Google TV is make the TV experience more interactive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">and just at least when you develop an app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">for it, it gives you one path for the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">where they normally wouldn't have your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">in front of them. And we know a lot of people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">today when they watch TV, they have their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">mobile phone or maybe their tablet, they check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">Twitter or they check some of their other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">social networks and the TV has the potential </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">to bring all these together. So, here's another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">home screen, or here's a snapshot of the home </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">screen, in case you haven't seen Google TV </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">and I know last year, a lot people who were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">at Google IO, they actually received a Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">TV, a box, an early version. So, this is what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">it looks like. It &mdash; in the background, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">see a live television. So this here was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">travel channel. You just click the home "Home" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">button and it overlays the home on top of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">your live TV. And it gives you very quick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">access, In this case, to Android applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="535">So, you see, a menu on the side here, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">can have browser bookmarks you can have Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">apps. And here's just a selection of some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">of the Android apps that are preloaded on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">the box. So, you have &mdash; what we chose a portfolio </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">of typical apps that people may want in their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">living room, we have something for sports </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">fans, you have your Netflix, you have your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">Pandora. So, I think it's an interesting platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">for users to get content while they're watching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">TV. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="566"> SAXMAN: I think, you know, one point &mdash; one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">thing to point out here too is it's not just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">a big phone, you know what I mean? It's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">a different type of device with a different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">type of interface, even though it's all built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">on top of Android. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="578"> KURZKE: Yes. So, this Android app, I mean, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">it's already &mdash; sort of the first indication &mdash; by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">the way, the home screen, of course, is also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">implemented in Android. But it's an indication </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">of how you should layout your app, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">make it very, very light on information. Keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">a lot of open space, people don't want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">see pages and pages of text on their TV screen. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="600">That's not an eReader. So, the other component </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">of Google TV is the remote control. If you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">think about how people interact with your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">Android application today, virtually, all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">Android applications use a touch interface, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">use a touch screen. Google TV, people sit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">10 feet away from the screen and it would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">be very inconvenient if they have to get up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">and walk to the TV and touch stuff. I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">that's why we invented remote controls, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">what the TV is used to be. So, Google TV comes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">with remotes. What we want is a full QWERTY </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">keyboard, I personally really hate when I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">have to search for shows and I have to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">an onscreen keyboard and navigate through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">ABCD. So, all the Google TVs come with a QWERTY </span><span class="line" data-startTime="650">keyboard, they do have a mouse pointer of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="650">sorts. So, the Sony remote, for example, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">has a little optical mouse joystick. But one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">of the main things is, it's not a touch screen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="664">So keep that in mind also and we'll go over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">some of the implications later. One key that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">I want to highlight is the search key. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">really believe that Google TV should help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">you find content that's relevant for you much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">faster, after all Google is really a search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">company, we know a lot about searching. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">we want to make it very easy for you when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">you watch TV to find content. So there's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">dedicated search key for the Android guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="691">amongst you, it brings up the system search, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="691">the system search box which we call the quick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">search box. And I'll show you what that looks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">like. So, on Google TV, when you press the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">search key and you enter a term, it will go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">through the system search, it will bring you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">content from different sources. So in this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">case, it's mainly YouTube content but it could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">also be content that's relevant for your TV </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">channel. So if you search for something were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">you have, let's say, a DVR recording or it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">a show that's coming in the future, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">schedule a recording. And for developers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">it's really cool because, as you see in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">bottom here, you can actually contribute results. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="730">So in this case, a YouTube application and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">the Amazon application contributed results </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">to this. So if you've developed an app that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="740">wants to get in front of the user and maybe, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="740">you know, search through your media library </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">or search through your photos, you can also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">contribute search results here. On this screen, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">I want to point out the little icon in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">bottom. So this is, today, were the notifications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">show up. I've heard people describe the Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">notification as sort of the new inbox. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">like, people get so much email, you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">even read email anymore but when something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">shows up in your notification bar, you typically &mdash; it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">grabs your attention. So, this is where notifications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">show up today, and in this case, the Pandora </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">app as you may know from your cellphone, every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">time it plays a new track, it notifies you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">just to keep you current if you're interested &mdash; what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">you're listening to in the background, maybe. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="790">So in this case, Pandora threw up a notification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">and said, "Hey, you know, I'm having a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">great new sound and &mdash; that I'm listening for." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">And the copyright owners of those probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">don't mind. So, yeah, so this is our Pandora </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">notification box and it's also a great way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">for you as an Android developer, it uses the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">regular Android notification APIs, so if your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">app has something new and exciting going on, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">you want the user to either be reminded of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">or maybe you just want to get in front of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">the user again, you can open up a notification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">or you can send a notification and the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="827">can open up the dialog. So, those last things, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="827">the search, the notification, it's all really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">pretty good integration but Google TV, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">we said earlier, it's based on the Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="841">platforms, and one of the really cool things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="841">you can do in Android is your application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="846">can integrate pretty deeply into the platform. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="846">So, on a mobile phone, you have a lot of ways, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">you have live wallpapers; you have things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">like widgets and so on. And on TV, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">a lot of ways &mdash; for example, here, you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">a live folder, so the user can configure the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">live folder showing the tweet timeline to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">show up right on the home screen. So you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">imagine, as a developer, it's not just a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">standalone experience, it's not start an app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">interact with an app and go back to the TV </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">watching. But, we really want to enable developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">to get in front of users and get integrated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">into the system. I think that's one, for me, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="887">I'm an Android guy, so I come from the Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="887">world. It's one of the really cool things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="892">that Android enables you to do. So, now that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="892">you've seen all the things that are possible, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="900">why would you develop an app for Google TV? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="900">I mean, besides, being a really cool platform, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">it's also typically the largest display in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">the house. Every time I visit my friends now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">and they have a little picture frame that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">shows like their last notification photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">on like the two inch LCD or whatever, four </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">inch LCD. I'm like, what's the point? Just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">use a TV. You have a 60 inch picture frame. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="923">So it's the largest display and you can just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">go wild and imagine what you as a developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">could show on the screen. I mean, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">a lot of really cool apps that are possible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="932">It's also connected to a really amazing sound </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">system. Typically, your TV or your hi-fi stereo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">in the living room, you don't need to plug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">anything in, Google TV is already connected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">to it and you as an app developer can use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">the sound system. And the other thing is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">supposedly in America, people spend five hours </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">a day watching TV. Keep in mind, this is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">America, I know you guys probably spend a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">lot more time on your computer. But this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">a stat &mdash; just looking at the media habits of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">teenagers, eight to eighteen year olds, even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">if you take everything else together, gaming, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="975">consoles, listening to music, playing video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="975">games, sitting on the computer, they spent &mdash; still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="981">spend 42% of their time more than computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="981">and video games together, just watching TV. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="989">So, being able to create applications around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">the TV, I think is really exciting for developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="996">And, I think that's also why we have gotten </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">a lot of really excited developers who keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">asking us, "So when can I get my app onto </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">Google TV?" And, as we said, we're not going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">to make any new announcements today but we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">stand by what we said last year. It's &mdash; the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">market is coming later this year and we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">working on it, we're very focus on it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1016"> SAXMAN: So, now that we know what Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1016">TV is, let's talk a little bit about how to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1022">develop for Google TV. From a developer's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1022">perspective, Google TV is really about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1027">power of choice. Google TV is &mdash; it's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1027">Android and the Web in one box and it's not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">just the Web but it's the HTML5 in a full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">Chrome Web browser which is different than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1038">most Android devices. So basically, this isn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1038">your grandmother's Web on TV, I mean this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">is a full Web experience. So given that developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">can take advantage of the Android platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1049">and a full Chrome Web browser, how should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1049">they decide what type of app to build? To </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1056">help answer that question; let's first take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1056">a look at what the Android platform has to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">offer. Android takes the Java language to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">new heights with APIs for layouts, graphic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1065">rendering, search, media, databases, the list </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1065">goes on and on. And since these APIs are shared </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1072">across all Android devices, the code developed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1072">on top of these APIs can be reused on mobile, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1078">tablet, and Google TV devices. And in some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1078">instances, the same app can be used in all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">three types of devices and it's &mdash; that's entirely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">possible. The apps themselves can be installed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1088">in a device with just a couple of clicks and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1088">they automatically update if the user allows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1093">it, which is a benefit to both users and developers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1093">Back to the APIs, since many of the Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">APIs access the hardware directly, developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">can leverage system hardware to accelerate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">performance and gain more control over how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">system resources are utilized. As a software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">platform, Android has a number of features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">that help developers design rich user interfaces </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">and streamline information flow. This list </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">is actually &mdash; the list on the &mdash; the slide here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">is actually just a small subset of what Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">has to offer to developers. We've cover some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1128">of these features already, such as notifications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1128">And many of these will be discussed further </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1134">at IO. But in summary, the Android platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1134">gives developers full control over both hardware </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">and software keyboards and buttons, and most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">cert &mdash; most notably the "back" and "search" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">buttons which is actually a big benefit; the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">ability to share data with other apps and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">display custom search results; the ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">to push notifications to users from background </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1153">services; a full multithreading based on Java </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1153">threads; and a very rich application framework </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">which includes intents, activities and services. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1160">All you Android guys are going to be very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1165">familiar with all of this. The main takeaway </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1165">here is that the Android platform gives developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1169">a lot of control over the design of their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1169">apps in terms of the interfaces and their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">architecture. There are definitely a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">opportunities; a lot more opportunities to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">hear about Android features at IO, but for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">Google TV in particular, don't forget to miss </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">Christian and Jason's talk on Wednesday, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">this guy here; in case you're looking for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">him in the hallway before hand, so. Here's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">another very good example of the power of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1194">Google TV in the Android platform. Here, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1194">see the Google &mdash; the quick search box again. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">The user has entered discovery off of his </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">or her search query. And we see results from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">the Web and the user's lineup, like we'd expect, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">which is very useful. And I see "MythBusters, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">Table Cloth Chaos" coming up in seven minutes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">which is actually one that I think I've missed, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">so maybe we want to cut this a little short. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1217">We also see that there are results from YouTube, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1223">Napster, and Amazon. We see these services </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1223">listed here with their exact number of search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">results since each service has an Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">app installed on Google TV, and each app has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1233">a searchable content provider for the information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1233">it manages. By using Android's APIs, developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1239">can deeply integrate their app with the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1239">TV platform. And what's unfortunately not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1243">shown here, apps can actually share information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1243">with one another. So on the other hand, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">Chrome and the Web; developers have access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">the HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and the Flash </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">platform, all of which are very powerful tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">for content delivery. Using this suite of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1264">technologies is relatively straight forward </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1264">for developers to create interfaces that work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1269">on multiple form, factors and displays, including </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1269">mobile screens, medium and high density tablets, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1275">desktop computers and televisions. There are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1275">a variety of tools for developing Web applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1282">many of which were created or refined over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1282">a number of years to make Web development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1285">very quick and easy. And if you already have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1285">an existing Web application, you can likely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1291">reuse most if not all of your content and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1291">code when you're creating a Google TV-enhanced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1296">website. If you do develop a truly great Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1296">application, your app could be feature on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">the Google TV spotlight which highlights the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">latest and greatest Web-based Google TV apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1305">available. And finally, with the Web, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1305">no need for developers to download or install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">your app, and updating is seamless. As soon </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">as you published its content, it's available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">to end users. And along those lines, for more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1314">information, if you're interested in building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">Web apps for Google TV, don't miss Chris and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">Dan's Tech Talk on Wednesday as well. Different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">times so you could actually make it to both. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">So here's an example of a Web application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">optimize for Google TV. The first thing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">you'll likely notice is that this app doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">look &mdash; doesn't look like a traditional website </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">at all and it looks like a TV application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1341">However, if you're familiar with HTML and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1341">CSS, you know that this page could easily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1345">be modified to look good on mobile devices, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1345">tablets or PCs. It's just a matter of changing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1350">a few parameters around. This app gives TV </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1350">viewers easy access to the information that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">they're likely to want via streamlined interface </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">with easy to read fonts, plenty of padding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1361">and simple navigation. And it also has full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1361">content search capability which is not integrated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">into the Google TV platform but Google TV </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">really has no problem searching Web content. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1374"> KURZKE: So just to wrap up in summary, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1374">I think for both, for Web developers and for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1381">Android developers, just some things to keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1381">in mind is really using large font sizes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1387">Your application is typically viewed in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">living room environment. People sit far back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1392">Reading paragraphs of text is hard. You don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1392">want too many line breaks in your text. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">other thing is on television, keep in mind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">there are two major resolutions that are supported </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">by modern televisions. It's called 1080p and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">720p. So, that's the number of lines. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1410">one is 1920 by 1080. The other is 1280 by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1410">720. And also, really when you design and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1418">sometimes it's different when you're in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1418">mobile mindset you always try to squeeze as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">much information as you can on the limited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">number of pixels. On TV just use larger icons. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">Keep more space between the icons. Make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">easy to navigate and don't overload the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1435">with too much information. What we have found </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1435">just over the last couple iterations that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1440">we've gone through is it's better to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1440">more a progressive disclosure. If you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">more information available, make it visible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">to the user but then give them a choice so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1451">either go into more details. Sometimes it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1451">easier to just show, say, a short video clip. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1457">The website that we saw, that Paul showed, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">with &mdash; just like a TV show information, having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">the cover art there or having a screenshot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">there is probably a lot more relevant to TV </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">users than having the full bio of all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">actors. If they want that information, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1472">can give them the option to get it but try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1472">to keep the amount of information on the screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1477">pretty light. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1477"> SAXMAN: So, with all the benefits of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1482">two platforms, it still might be hard to decide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1482">which one to use to develop your app, so ultimately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1487">you might have to make a pragmatic decision. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1487">There are a few questions to help guide you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">in making this decision though. Basically, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">are you currently working on an Android app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">that you'd like to see on Google TV? Or do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">you already have a Web-based application that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1500">you could migrate? Or if you've &mdash; you had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1500">to start working on an Android app or website </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1505">do you have existing code or expertise that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1505">you could use? For performance, do you need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1510">access to Android's low-level APIs or is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1510">performance that you get with Chrome enough, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">which is actually usually more than enough? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">And finally, do you want to share information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1519">with the Google TV platform or other Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1519">applications like we saw with search? If so, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1524">building an Android is definitely going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1524">be the right choice. And there's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1529">a really good talk coming up if you're still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1529">looking for more information about HTML versus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">Android. It's also going to be at Wednesday. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">It's a different time than the other two talks, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1537">so I think you could... </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1537"> KURZKE: You can do both. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1539"> SAXMAN: ...go to all three. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1539"> KURZKE: Yeah, you can do them three in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1541">a row and after that you'll know everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1541">about Google TV. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1543"> SAXMAN: Exactly. Yeah. So, yeah, definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1543">be sure to stop by and check that out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1548"> KURZKE: So, just, yeah, in summary here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1548"> SAXMAN: Yeah. I'm just going to say, before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1555">we dive into the specifics of building Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1555">apps on Google TV, here are some pointers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">to getting started with building Web applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1559">The rest of the talk is going to be about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">Android so, you know, this is your last chance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">to look this stuff up. Again, be sure to stop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1571">by Chris and Dan's Tech Talk on Wednesday. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1571">Visit the Google TV Documentation Website, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1576">lots of great information there. Right now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1576">you can see it's targeted towards Web but, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">you know, we have Android documentation coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">as well. Join the Google TV Web Developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1586">Forum where there's lots of discussion about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1586">building Web apps for Google TV. And finally, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1591">check out the Google TV Website Gallery where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1591">you can go for inspiration for building your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1595">own apps. Even if you're sold on developing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1595">a native Android app for Google TV, these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">resources have a wealth of information for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">developers that you absolutely shouldn't overlook. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">So... </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1606"> KURZKE: Cool. So, now I would like to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1612">with you some of the, you know, best practices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1612">for developing Android apps and just some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">of the lessons we have learned. And also for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">people who are not familiar with Android I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1621">actually very excited to see so many of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1621">already are Android developers, so I could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1625">go over some of it a little faster. But in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1625">order to develop Android apps, all the tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1631">you need are available to you for free. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1631">can download them. For Google TV since it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">just another compatible Android platform, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">technically you can use the same tools and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1644">really the difference is you're developing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1644">for a large screen device. What you can do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">with Android is you can have different resources </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">for different screen sizes or different resolutions. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">So, in this example here I've just created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">a regular Android project and I've created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">resource folders for HDPI and XHDPI resolution. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1664">And I'll explain a little more about this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">later why those two. But if you are familiar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">with Android, you know, resources can be things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">like icons, can be graphics or it can be layouts. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1679">So here is just another screenshot showing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">you some of the dialogues. And the regular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">Android SDK already gives you the opportunity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">to create qualifiers for high density large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">screens. And if you want to, you can add No </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1702">Touch to it just to explicitly call out that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1702">this is for devices which don't have a touch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">screen today. The other feature in the Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">SDK that you can use is you can create custom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1716">layouts. Typically, when you install an off-the-shelf </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1716">Android SDK today, it will come with predefined </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1724">layouts or predefined screen sizes for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1724">layout editor for major like phone resolutions. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1731">So we have the 480 by 800 for the Nexus class </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1731">phones, or we have the 1200 &mdash; I think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1738">1280 by 800 for tablets. If you want to develop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1738">for Google TV, you would have to create your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1745">own custom layout size for the screen resolution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1745">of the Google TV. So, the way you would do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1753">this is you just click on the little custom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1753">icon and you can give it any name you want. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1758">You can call it Google TV, whatever. And you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1758">would configure it with the resolutions that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1765">you expect your TV to have. And I'll share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1765">a little bit of information with you. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">the typical TV resolution that we find is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">213 DPIs. So, that's a good value to use. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1779">And I just called this the 720p resolution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">and I defined the screen sizes as a 1280 by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">720 screen size, high density. Of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">it's a landscape device. So, that's one other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1793">thing to keep in mind when you develop applications. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1793">TVs typically only come in one orientation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1798">It's pretty hard to reorient the TV. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1798">easier for yourself to lie on the couch. That </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">doesn't still make it a portrait. So, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">just one way to define the layout editor. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1810">And here's the reason I don't work in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1810">UX team. So, I just used all this and I created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">a mock for Google TV application. So, I used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">the parameters that I've just defined to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">a layout. And you can use the Android layout </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">editor in Eclipse and you can just drag and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1829">drop very simple UIs. I've just taken a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1829">of buttons, a couple of icons and a few checkboxes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">and stuff and put it together on a UI, probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">not the best work I've ever done but it brings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1843">across the point you can use the layout editor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1843">with those custom layouts to create layouts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">for large screens. So, why would you go through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">all this hassle? You can also create an emulator </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1858">today. So you can use the Android SDK Emulator. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1858">And as we said earlier today, Google TV runs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1867">on API level seven, so that's Android 2.1 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1867">Eclair. So if you want to be compatible with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1875">today's version, you can just create an emulator </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1875">based on this and you can set the screen size </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">to 1280 by 720 which is a reasonable value </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">for 720p and you set again the LCD density </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1891">to 213 and pick your value for heap size. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1891">What you can do with this is you can start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">an emulator and you can actually run your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">app on an emulator. Here's an example, an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1906">app running on a desktop emulator. It does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1906">still show the phone menu bar on top if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1913">display the menu &mdash; or the top icon bar. Just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1913">ignore that for now. Why would you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1919">do that? Well, the reason is you can test </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1919">your app. You can test it up out on a large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1923">screen, see if your layout scale, see if your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1923">resources scale. It's just an exercise to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">sort of get ahead of the curve and get your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">app ready for, you know, maybe in the future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1935">This is not a replacement for running it on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1935">on a real TV. But I think for a developer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1940">what I found is going through for example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1940">this exercise with some of our partners, it's &mdash; sometimes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1949">Android applications they look really nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1949">on a large screen. They basically just work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1955">if you do all the right things. You use relative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1955">layout. You use scalable nine-patch images. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">But running your app on a large screen emulator, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">it will point out typically a few hard-coded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">assumptions that you may have made or it may </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1968">point out some of the bugs. So I think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1973">a good practice, especially now that we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1973">tablets as well. Just try and run your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1978">on a large screen. See what it looks like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1978">and it will help you, I think, create better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1983">Android applications all the way around. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1983">you may wonder how we came up with some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">the constants that I mentioned, so you may </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">have picked up &mdash; I used large screen. The first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">question that everybody has is, if you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">familiar with Android, actually, this phone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">here, the Nexus S, is considered a large screen, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">how come my TV is not bigger than a Nexus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2009">S? It's very simple; if you looked at it from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2009">a 10-foot distance, you'll notice that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2014">TV actually appears fairly smaller in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2014">distance so we just took the large screen, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2021">sort of &mdash; we believe that a TV should have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2021">about as much information on it as your cell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">phone application, as your mobile application. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">And the other constant that I came up withóthe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2033">resolution, so I used extra high density or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2033">high density depending on 720 or 10 ATP, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">if you walk up close to a TV and you really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">stand, like, as close to your TV as you would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2047">stand to your tablet or to your phone, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2047">notice the physical resolution on the screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2052">is actually about 50 pixels per inch or you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2052">can just do the math. And how do we get from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2058">50 pixels to 200 pixels? It's again the distance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2058">The other advantage of this is if we choose </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">the extra high density, this will scale all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">the Android DPs, the display independent pixels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">or resolution independent pixels. So if you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">familiar with the way how Android handles </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2079">DPs and you do the math, you will realize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2079">that your apps scale approximately twice as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2087">much. So if you have extra high density is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2087">320 DPs, as compared to a 160 DPs for normal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">density. So if you just have an Android app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">and you don't do anything and you just run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">it on TV and you use DPs the way we recommend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">in the documentation, then your app will scale </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2108">all the assets twice as much and you will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2108">actually look reasonably well. So this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2113">really to make it easier for developers. As </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2113">Paul said earlier, to create one app that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2117">runs across all devices. And I've actually &mdash; for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2117">exercise purposes, created a few apps that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">look really well on different displays. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">you can create really one layout that scales </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">nicely from a regular phone size through a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">tablet all the way through a TV. Another bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2137">of TV technology that I want to point is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2137">a few of you are probably old enough to remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2144">that TVs used to have television CRTs with, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2144">like, scan lines and electron beams and whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">lot of physics and stuff. And it's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">really cool technology that's unfortunately, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">still haunting us today. So the concept of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">scan lines is still there and if you look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">at 1080p resolution today, so the word 1080p, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">it's actually the 1,080 scan lines that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2175">would have on an electron &mdash; on a good old-fashioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2175">CRT. And that is really the physical addressable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2181">screen size that is available in TV. The other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2181">thing that you may notice next time when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">watch, like, your favorite news channel or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">your favorite sports channel, you'll probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">notice that they never put something that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">really super important all the way in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2197">corners because, actually, you never know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2197">how much shows up on your consumer's television. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2204">So if you look at the TV specs, they actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2204">specify about a five to ten percent safety </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2212">margin around the edge because back in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2212">days when it was electron beams zipping across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2217">CRTs, you never knew if they were actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2217">calibrated properly. So TV broadcasters typically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">show the relevant content, game scores or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">stock tickers, they show stuff that's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2231">important about, you know, a couple of pixels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2231">off the edge. And just to be on the safe side, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">the recommendation is keep about 10% so you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">pretty safe that all the TV manufactures will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">actually work with this. So what this means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">for a developer is &mdash; I said early, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2249">two main resolutions, we have 1080p and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2249">have 720p but when you create an app, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">can be pretty sure that it will not have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">full screen resolution running on your TV. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2261">And that may be mechanical issues or mechanical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">reasons like your decorative aluminum bezel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">may actually cover up a couple of pixels on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">each side. When you set up a Google TV, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2272">calibrate to the visible area on your screen. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2272">And when you run an Android app and you do, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2278">for example, a canvas that's full screen and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2278">you donít get width, you may end up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">fewer pixels. And so the numbers that included </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">here, this is actually the worst-case scenario </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">so this is the 10% margin on each side so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">that's really the minimum but also don't go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">to the minimum. So my advice would really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">be expect the worst but have relative layouts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2302">that then float and use right aligned, left </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2302">aligned, top, bottom and make your UI look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">pretty that way. And I think the best practices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">for Android developers to really create a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2315">great app that really stands out from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2315">rest is really using the dynamic layouts; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323">think about the overscan, test with the minimum </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323">resolution, test with the maximum resolution. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2329">One concept that I know we have been talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2329">about almost as long as Android is around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2335">is 9-patch images. And especially designing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2335">for TV, 9-patches get even more important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2342">Because if you think about it, basically the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2342">amount of memory that you need for your onscreen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2349">assets, for things like buttons, really grows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2349">with the square basically of your resolution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2356">because you need X and Y, if you double it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2356">you have four times as much memory for your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2360">little icons. So using 9-patches to do the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2360">scaling for you is really an elegant way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">do it. And, especially, I really encourage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">developers to not put, like, pre-rendered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2371">text on their buttons or something but use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2371">the Android mechanisms to just bring the 9-patch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2376">for the button background and then put a text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2376">over it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2381"> SAXMAN: And so, great internationalization </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2381">as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2383"> KURZKE: Definitely, yeah. I mean, it &mdash; the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2383">way &mdash; what I found is running Android apps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2388">just random Android apps on Google TV, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2388">really shows which developers were sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2394">keeping with the best practices, going the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2394">extra mile, keeping it really dynamic layout. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2400">And I think it really helps you find the couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2400">of bugs in your app. And keep in mind, your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2406">user, a 10-foot design &mdash; you are creating apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2406">for somebody who just came home from work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2412">and really just wants to kick back in their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2412">recliner and watch TV and interact with your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2417">app maybe. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2417"> SAXMAN: So Google TV apps actually come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2423">in lots of different shapes and sizes and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2423">how you design your app ultimately depends </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">on the use cases that you're targeting. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">can certainly have one app for multiple platforms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2433">which is, by far, the hardest to implement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2433">but really the easiest to maintain. Or you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">could build separate apps actually tailored </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">to each of your use cases which are, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2444">for phones, tablets, and Google TVs. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2444">will allow you to target different but related </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2449">use cases by each app and take full advantage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2449">of the higher resolutions of Google TV. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2453">is primarily true for full screen assets on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2453">Google TV since it has a much higher resolution. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2459">The third option is to build a companion app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2459">that targets the same use cases in existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2463">app but is designed specifically for the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2463">TV experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2466"> KURZKE: Yeah. I think, speaking of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2466">companion app, one thing to keep in mind also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2471">is, the TV screen is usually a shared screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2471">in your living room. Your family is watching; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2477">maybe on Sunday, you have your buddies over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2477">and they're going to watch the TV. So, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2481">an app developer, keep that in mind, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2481">that sometimes means. So having, for example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2486">my tweet stream on TV, yeah, sure, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2486">cool. I mean that's public information. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2491">having my personal inbox show up in notification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2491">every time somebody sends me a tweet, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2496">may not want that when your buddies come over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2496">on Sunday. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2500"> SAXMAN: So a couple of quick tips on, actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2500">conquering the TV. If you really want to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2507">the greatest bang for your buck when building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2507">your Google TV app, be sure to reuse as much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2511">of existing Android code as possible. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2511">once you've identified what code you can reuse, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2516">focus on user interface specifically, building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2516">specialized user interfaces only where needed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2522">Really, the idea here is reduce, reuse, recycle, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2522">and only redesign where necessary. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2528"> KURZKE: So here's a couple examples of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2528">TV apps and so this is the mobile app from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2537">CNBC and what we did is, when created the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2537">TV app for CNBC, we worked with the team and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2544">we looked at the mobile app, and we looked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2544">at the Website and we found that the TV app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2550">should probably be different from both experiences. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2550">On the mobile phone you want to have your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2555">stock portfolio, you want to have quick access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2555">to information. The website is really to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2560">and find a lot more out &mdash; find background information. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2560">So for the TV app, the team actually brought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2567">in some of the interactive content &mdash; or not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2567">interact &mdash; some of the visual content from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2573">their CNBC channel and they added the broadcast </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2573">clips to the stock information. So they reused </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">a lot of their Android code from the mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">phone so the whole portfolio management, all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2586">the app logic is mainly reused from the mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2586">app. And they also added the broadcast information. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2594">So I worked with the CNBC team over the course </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2594">of last year to create the app that's on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2600">Google TV today. And what's actually really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2600">exciting is they did almost of the opposite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2605">of what you would be able to do. So they used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2605">the mobile &mdash; they used the TV experience and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2611">then actually optimized this to the table </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2611">experience. I saw they just &mdash; I think a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2617">of days ago, launched their tablet app, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2617">looks very much like the TV app. And so, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2620">think, having the large screen Android devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2620">now is really an interesting opportunity to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2626">create apps that work on larger screen and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2626">maybe bring some more interactive visual content. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2632">Here is another app which you maybe familiar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2632">with. It's the Pandora Internet Radio App. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2639">So it's &mdash; this is the mobile app, so they had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2639">a very clean simple user interface, showing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2645">the cover art, showing the artist's information, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2645">and giving you a very quick, you know, thumbs-up, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2650">thumbs-down sort of interface. They were actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2650">able to reuse most of their layout and most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2658">of their code for the TV app. So this just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2658">goes to show, if you have a user experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2663">that make sense in mobile and make sense on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2663">the TV, you can virtually use most of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2670">app just as is. What they also did to optimize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2670">is they used the key codes for our remote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2678">control, so on the remote you can pause, forward, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2678">play. And so they just used all those key </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2686">codes to make it much easier to interact with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2686">the music player. So you don't have to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2690">the mouse cursor, and like go over and click </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2690">on buttons or use the 5-way navigation. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2696">those are just two examples that show how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2696">you can take a mobile app and actually reuse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2702">a lot of your work and transform it into a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2702">TV experience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2706"> SAXMAN: Okay. So before we wrap up there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2706">a couple more tips that we want to pass on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2711">to you guys before you start building your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2711">Google TV app. Christian just mentioned the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2716">5-way navigation which is actually accomplished </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2716">via the D-Pad. Google TV devices have full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2721">QWERTY keyboards and often have track pads </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2721">or some other form of touch-based navigation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2727">However, the primary mode of user interaction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2727">with Google TV is 5-way or the &mdash; or D-Pad, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2733">which is Directional Pad. When testing your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2733">apps, keep your thumb on the D-Pad and not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2738">the track pad, so that you can assure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2738">users are able to navigate quickly and easily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2742">in your app. Same is true when using the emulator, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2742">focus on your keyboard and the &mdash; and your directional </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2748">keys as opposed to using your mouse. Especially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2748">keep D-Pad Navigation in mind when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2756">designing your layouts. What we see here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2756">a fairly standard app interface which includes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2762">the tab bar for changing between content, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2762">a vertical list view in the center, and a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2768">button down at the bottom there. This interface </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2768">is relatively common on mobile devices and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2773">tablets since and is very compact and easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2773">to control with the tips of one's fingers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2778">However, things get more tricky if the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2778">navigates this interface using their D-Pad. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2783">The issue is, is that if the user wants to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2783">go from the tab to the button they actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2787">have to scroll through the entire list, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2787">the center there. So what we recommend in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2791">this situation, is to actually re-orient your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2791">layout. Here, we've actually taken the tabs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2799">and the button, moved them to the left and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2799">right of the vertically scrolling area. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2803">user can actually use their &mdash; the Directional </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2803">Pad up and down to navigate the tabs, up and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2807">down to navigate within the vertical scrolling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2807">list, and you know, left and right to scroll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2813">between those three controls, so. It's still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2813">a clean compact interface, but now it's very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2819">easy to navigate using D-Pad. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2819"> KURZKE: Also, the one thing to keep in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2824">mind is &mdash; what's very apparent is a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2824">apps typically are &mdash; when they are designed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2829">for portrait mode, they have the &mdash; they'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2829">use a paradigm where you have list views and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2834">then buttons in the bottom. When you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2834">a list view that's about four-feet wide, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2840">gets really hard to navigate. So if you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2840">like a check box on one side and the name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">is on the other side, keeping list views narrow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">and having multiple columns is usually a much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2850">better user experience in general. So with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2850">that, let's see, summary. We've pointed out, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2862">there is a huge opportunity to create applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2862">for TV, and there is a large variety of devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2868">to target now, so especially for Android developers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2868">I mean, we're basically adding new devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2874">and we're adding new form factors as fast </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2874">as we can. I mean, we just gave you tablets. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2880">Now there is TV, so there is &mdash; there is a huge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2880">opportunity I think to leverage your Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2884">skills. The different screen sizes are definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2884">giving you a whole new opportunity to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2891">new applications. Suddenly you have, basically, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2891">a four square-foot or so display in the living </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2898">room that you can work on, or you have a whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2898">home theatre. And the good news is Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2903">already has a lot of built-in mechanisms to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2903">support all these. So the Android APIs and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2909">the Android, like all the mechanisms and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2909">best practices allow you to create apps for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2914">phones, for tablets, for TVs and who knows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2914">what's next. And then also, you can create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2920">apps that easily support multiple platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2920">versions. So as Android developers, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2924">probably already familiar with all the different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2924">ways how you can create apps that run well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2930">across different apps. So I would like to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2930">do the &mdash; one little Steve Jobs thing. But wait, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2937">I have one more thing for you. So actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2937">I'm really thankful that you all stayed to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2944">the end. So what I want to share for &mdash; share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2944">with you is, we don't have this here today, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2950">but starting tomorrow you can go to the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2950">TV booth, and we have a little Sandbox on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2955">the third floor, and pick up a flyer. So we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2955">have this program that we call the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2962">TV Fishtank and what we &mdash; what we want is if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2962">you submit your ideas and if you give us great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2968">ideas that you would want to implement on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2968">Google TV, you can sign-up and we will look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2974">at the submissions and we will select recipients </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2974">on a &mdash; on a rolling basis to receive developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2981">devices. So those developer devices will be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2981">Google TV devices enabled with ADB, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2988">as a developer can run your own apps and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2988">don't have to just run them on the desktop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2993">emulator. I must say it's a really cool experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2993">to see your app the first time on your own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2998">TV at home. So come back tomorrow to the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2998">TV Sandbox on the third floor, pick-up a flyer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3006">and we'll get you set-up with a really cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3006">development environment. All right. One question. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3022">Can you please use the microphone? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3022"> Sure. Hypothetically, say that you're from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3027">Sweden, would it still possible to enroll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3027">in this program? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3032"> KURZKE: You would have to check with our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3032">guys. I believe right now we're focusing mainly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3039">on the U.S. but I think if you have an incredibly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3039">compelling application, I encourage you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3043">talk with our business guys about that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3043"> I'll think about that. Okay, thank you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3047"> KURZKE: Yes, please. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3047"> If your apps use native code? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3055"> KURZKE: Yes. Sorry. So right now, since </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3055">Google TV &mdash; it also runs on Intel processors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3066">we don't support native code currently. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3066"> Is that in the works to add that to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3070">emulator? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3070"> KURZKE: We're super-focused getting this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3073">out, but I don't have a timeline on that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3073">[INDISTINCT] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3079"> Question about &mdash; is the Chrome browser we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3079">see in the Google TV, so what type of difference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3085">between the Chrome browser we see in Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3085">TV versus the Chrome browser running on a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3091">standard PC, specially on the Chrome apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3091">store part? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3095"> KURZKE: I don't know the answer about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3095">Chrome apps store, but it is very much a Linux-based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3104">Chrome browser. So by the way, if all of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3104">have more questions we have office hours and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3110">a Sandbox upstairs where we have engineers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3110">and we have actually two units that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3115">see some demos on. So that's on the second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3115">floor, kind of like this direction roughly. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3121">So and I'll be hanging out there for a while </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3121">and I think Paul is going to be there most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3124">of the day too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3124"> SAXMAN: A yeah. We got a couple of more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3129">minutes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3129"> KURZKE: Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3130"> SAXMAN: Go ahead. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3130"> Okay. I'm coming from a YouTube partner </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3134">channel-based background, and my question </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3134">to you guys is are you planning on developing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3140">additional YouTube interfaces for Google TV </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3140">beyond what clearly looks like a very YouTube </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3146">beneficial search type &mdash; search type box? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3146"> KURZKE: So what Google TV already does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3153">is we integrate with our video site map search, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3153">so if you have video site maps for your content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3160">on your site, that will definitely be surfaced. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3160">Beyond that, I believe we have the YouTube </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3167">Leanback experience and you can also download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3167">some of the CSS, and some of the samples to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3173">get started. So if you as a partner want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3173">create optimized sites, so right now, we have &mdash; in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3179">the Spotlight, we have for example, a VEVO </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3179">application which uses some of the YouTube </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3184">posted content, but adds additional just cover </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3184">information and stuff to it. So I think, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3191">you want to get really creative you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3191">create &mdash; you could use wrappers around the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3196">YouTube experience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3196"> Thanks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3198"> Hi. Can you hear me? So I actually had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3198">a one good question and a bad one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3206"> KURZKE: Sure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3206"> The good one is, how about identity? I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3210">mean, one of the big things is, you, know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3210">TV is shared, but all the other devices you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3210">talking about... </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3210"> KURZKE: Right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3211"> ...are individualized. Are you going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3211">do anything to allow multiple users, et cetera, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3215">on the TV side? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3215"> KURZKE: So currently we don't have that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3218">yet. And I think Android; in general, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3218">more of a single user experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3223"> Yes. Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3223"> KURZKE: So this is great feedback, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3227">we know this is something we need to work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3227">on, so yes. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3230"> So the bad question now is, all the stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3230">I'm hearing is still kind of treating the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3236">applications as a secondarily app that's overlaid </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3236">on your content. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3240"> KURZKE: Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3240"> But are you actually, at some point, going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3241">to start allowing context to be shared between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3241">them, so you can actually bring up apps related </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3246">to what you're watching without the user being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3246">in the mix? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3249"> KURZKE: I think that is definitely a &mdash; I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3249">think that's a very valid use case. What we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3255">want to do in the future is have APIs specific </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3255">for TVs. We're not there yet, so stay tuned. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3263"> I was wondering what would happen if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3263">have an Android app that uses WebKit? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3270"> KURZKE: WebKit runs on Google TV today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3270">So you can just open up a Web view. We've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3278">actually seen a couple of the developers do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3278">that for content, so that would work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3283"> It doesn't have to be rewritten because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3283">the primary browser is Chrome? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3286"> KURZKE: No. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3286"> Okay. Okay. </span></p>
