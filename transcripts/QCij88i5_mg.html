<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="27"><span class="speakerName">Johanna Wright</span>: Let's step </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">back to January 2003. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="31">At this point in time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">I'm living in my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">father in-law's house. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="35">He's put a nice curtain up for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">my section of the living room, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">where my husband and I share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">an air mattress. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="43">The sun streams in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="44">6:00 AM we wake up every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">morning because of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">unbearable Orange County heat. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="49">Air mattress is popped, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">and I'm unemployed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="53">Just six months earlier, I was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">young tech exec in New York, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">first during the dot-com </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">boom and then bust. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="61">But my company that I worked at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">had finally shut its doors. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="64">And my husband and I decided </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">to get on our bicycles and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">ride across the country </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">to lovely, sunny LA. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="72">Riding across the country </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">with your new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">husband is a lot of fun. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="76">Showing up in LA, a new city, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">with no job, not so much fun. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="83">Then the rejection letters from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">business schools started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">pouring in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="87">And it's January, and there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">only one business school I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">haven't heard back from. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="93">But I'm not feeling too </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">optimistic because they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">supposed to interview all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">their candidates, and they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">going to mail out their verdict </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">two days later, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">they still haven't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">interviewed me. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="102">But then I got an email from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">UCLA that said we want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">interview you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="107">And since my confidence had been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">shot, my response was, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">"You do?" I was fortunate enough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">to get to go to UCLA </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">for business school, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">I got a job at Google. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="121">And today I'm going to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">about my career starting out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">at Google and what it was like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">to be a Product Manager at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">Google and give some bits </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">of advice about product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">management. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="130">But my first piece of career </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">advice is that your career is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">not going to be linear. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="135">Expect to be disrupted. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="137">This is a disruptive industry, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="137">and you, too, may someday be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">unemployed on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">father-in-law's couch. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="145">What's really going to matter is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">the energy and the tenacity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">with which you pick yourself </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">up and take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">on your next adventure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="153">OK, so let's jump into Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="155">I was hired to be a Product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">Manager working in Search. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="158">My boss gave me two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">options of jobs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="160">One was something called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">Universal Search. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="163">Universal Search was the project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">where we took all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">content from our different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">back ends &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">maps, videos, images &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">and we put them in the main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">search results pane. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="172">The other option that she gave </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">me was to do something called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">Premium Content Search. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="176">This is where we searched all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">the content behind pay walls </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">and put it in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">search results. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="182">Both these things seemed pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">interesting, and I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">so new to Google, I didn't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">any context or judgment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">to make a decision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="189">Fortunately for me, I had gone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">to the same business school as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">Susan Wojcicki, my fellow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">panelist, and so I asked her </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">for some advice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="197">Susan looked at me like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">I had two heads. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="200">What? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">Of course you should do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">Universal Search. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="202">That's our business, Johanna. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="206">So this leads to another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">piece of career wisdom. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="209">What does a good opportunity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">look like? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">Well, a good opportunity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">looks like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">something that's strategic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="213">If you're doing something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">that's in line with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">company's mission and it has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">not been done before, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">then it's very likely to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">be a good opportunity. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="222">OK, so let me jump into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">Universal Search. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="227">This was 2005 at Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="229">Google was growing like crazy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="230">It was very chaotic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="233">And it's kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">hard to know &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">for me it was hard to know how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">projects got assigned, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">you're working on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="239">And I got paired up with an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">infrastructure team while I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">was working on Universal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">Search. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="244">This was a great team, but a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">team that was very focused on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">building infrastructure, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">and they didn't want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">to build any features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="250">And I was a Product Manager, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">I was being judged on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">features that I launched. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="254">And so it was pretty stressful, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">because I wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">delivering anything. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="258">And so what I ended up doing was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">creating a set of mocks, a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">series of mocks of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">Universal Search could look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">like, and then I created a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">little PowerPoint deck, and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">walked around Google, and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">introduced myself to anyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">who looked like they might want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">to be a Features Tech </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">Lead to see if they wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">to join my project. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="275">And I was fortunate enough to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">meet a person named David </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">Bailey, who wanted to join on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">and lead the features side of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">the effort. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="283">And then the project really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">started to get legs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="287">So here's the beginning of my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">product management specific </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">advice, and that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">to paint a vision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="293">Once you paint a vision and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">share your vision, people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">will follow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="296">It'll be a lot easier to follow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">once you have a vision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="300">OK, so David and I started. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="302">There was a big mountain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">in front of us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="304">We didn't really know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="304">what to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="306">This project had failed a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">number of times before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="308">We didn't really know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">why it had failed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="310">And I had this idea that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">should do a user study. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="315">Just trying to figure out what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">to do, we said, well, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">just do a user study. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="317">So we pulled together </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">a prototype </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">to do our user study. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="320">And once we had this prototype, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">the people around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">us in Google started to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">able to imagine that this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">product might come to life and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">that something might happen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="331">And so this brings me to my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">second piece of product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">management advice, which is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">if you don't really know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">what to do, you should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">just do something. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="339">Do something to move </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">the ball forward. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="345">I was very fortunate, though, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">that a user study was what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">decided to do, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">people loved it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="352">And it was so awesome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="353">We learned that the project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">and the product had legs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="356">So I remember sitting in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">labs, and it was in the spring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">of 2006, for our user study. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="362">And one of the searches </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">we asked people to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">do was Barry Bonds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="365">Now, this was a long time ago. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="368">This was the Dark Ages. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="369">YouTube was just starting out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="371">But there was a home video that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">someone had uploaded of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">Barry Bonds tying Babe Ruth's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">home run record. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="377">And the participant in our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">study, she clicked on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">video, she watched the ball sail </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">out into the field, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="386">she had this big smile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="386">on her face. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="388">It wasn't unnatural at all that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">she saw this video in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">search results. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="392">So we knew the project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">had legs, and it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">just a great moment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="398">So my final and most important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">piece of product management </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">advice is to listen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">to your users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="405">And even more importantly, use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">your products yourself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="409">Just this weekend when I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">using Android Search, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">noticed that speech recognition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">is slow, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">maybe one in seven times. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="417">I don't know why, but I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">really glad that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">investing in speed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="421">Then I also had some magical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">experiences with Google Now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="424">So I was invited to go to a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">birthday party in Burlingame, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">and Google Now reminded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">me about the party. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="429">And it even told me that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">Burlingame was 30 minutes from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">my house, which I didn't know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">and it was super helpful. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="436">The more you use your products, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">the easier it is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">make decisions and to have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">intuitive feel for what you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">should be doing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="444">So let's summarize my product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">management advice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="447">One, paint a vision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="449">Two, when you don't know what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">to do, just make mini </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">milestones. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="453">Roll that ball forward. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="455">And three, use your products. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="460">Since this is a Women's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">Techmakers event, I thought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">I'd close with my very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">own lean-in story. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="467">So back when all this Universal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">Search stuff was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">going on, I ended up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">getting pregnant. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="472">And when I was eight months </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">pregnant, my boss, Marissa </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">Mayer, suggested that I lead a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">team of senior engineers to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">come up with the search strategy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">for the next year. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="483">Now, the search strategy, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">process, the normal process, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">was to set this meeting in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">mid-November, but my baby was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">supposed to be born at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">the end of October. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="494">And they're like, hey, no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">problem, we'll just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">move the date up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="497">Didn't give me very much time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">to prepare, and my baby was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">something that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">call transverse. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="503">So he's lying on his side, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">I had to have a C-section. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="507">So they moved the date up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="508">I moved my C-section to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">very last possible date. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="511">We met in the middle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="512">And on Wednesday, I gave the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">strategy presentation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="516">On Thursday, I had my baby. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="522">Now, this might be horrifying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">to some of you, but to me it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">was invigorating. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="525">And it set me up to have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">leadership role in Search when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">I returned from my leave. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="531">And the point I want you to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">away is not that you need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">to sacrifice your family </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">for your career. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="536">I feel fortunate enough that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">I haven't had to do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="539">You see, there was no question </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">in my mind that given that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">opportunity, I would want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">give that presentation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="545">And it was really huge that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">my manager believed in me. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="549">So the takeaway that I'd like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">us to take is that as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">managers, we shouldn't assume </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">people's abilities or desires. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="556">We should ask. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="557">As managers, it's our job to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">enable greatness in our teams. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="562">[APPLAUSE] </span></p>
