<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/OPfvnfnFuBs">youtu.be/OPfvnfnFuBs</a><div id="transcript"><p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="0"><span class="speakerName">Matt Mcneill</span>: Hi everyone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2">I'm Matt. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3">This is Tom. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="4">Welcome to the session, Here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">Be BigQuery at I/O. Just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">before I start, I've got a bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">of a confession to make. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="12">I developed a bit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">an addiction over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">the last six months. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="16">It started back in November, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">someone internally sent me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">an email with an invitation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">to "join the resistance." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">For anyone who's played Ingress, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">you all know what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">that means. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="28">I've gone through about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="28">two pairs of shoes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="31">I've walked more miles in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">last six months than I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">I've walked in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">last six years. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="35">It's been a really interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">experience, because it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">probably been one of the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">engaging, social, fun sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">games I've played in years. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="45">And I've been working a lot over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">the last few months, few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">years, in social gaming, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">particularly working with some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">big gaming customers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">in Europe, Gamesys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">being one of them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="57">And it really got me thinking, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">how do you create that sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">level of engagement in a game? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">You look at a game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">like Ingress &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">how do you get that level </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">of addiction in a game? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">So when I started looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">this, you see these statistics </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">that actually have been around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">for a couple of years. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="75">But so many games that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">developers are building, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">get installed once, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">they're never played again. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="82">Something like 25%. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="85">And if you're writing a game, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">the finances associated with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">these &mdash; the real business </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">of a game &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">is difficult. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="91">An average game life cycle can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">range between weeks and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">months, but let's say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">five or six weeks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="98">When you're planning your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">business, that's when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">going to try to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">the money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="102">But if you can crack this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">engagement problem, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">start pushing out beyond that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">and everything that comes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">after that is profit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="111">And that's important when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">really in the business </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">of casual gaming. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="115">So I started thinking about what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">are some of the drivers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">around this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="119">And one of the big trends </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">that I've seen come up &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">and this is some basic research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">I did on Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">Trends &mdash; was there's a big trend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">coming up around social </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">gaming and the connected game. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="131">Of course, if you don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">a connected game, it's very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">difficult to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">make it social. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="137">A game back end enables that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="137">social dimension to a game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="140">Ingress is a good example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">of course, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">quite an extreme way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="143">Though there's some other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">drivers that came </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">out as well for that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="147">Second was &mdash; this surprised me, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">actually &mdash; but a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">people are starting to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">connected games to push some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">of their game logic out of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">client for piracy issues. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="157">So there's a great story in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">the press a few weeks ago, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">where someone had built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">a game simulation &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">a simulation game of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">a game company. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="168">And what they were able to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">is detect whether the client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">had been pirated or not. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="172">And they played a bit of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">joke, and made sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">anyone who'd pirated the game, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">their company went bust. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="179">The virtual company went bust </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">because of pirates. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="181">And there were all these forums </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">online where people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">were, oh my god, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">game's awful! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">I keep getting done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">by pirates! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="190">It was great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="191">And this is the sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">of fun that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">are starting to have. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="194">But I think probably one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">the most important areas, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">actually, comes out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">of measurement. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="198">If you've got a connected game, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">you can start measuring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">in a way that really has not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">been possible before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="205">And I think one of the reasons </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">I was really keen on doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">this session is I think some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">the work that Tom's done in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">Gamesys is some of the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">advanced work I've seen in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">really developing this idea of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">a science of engagement, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">retention, and keeping those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">users playing the game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="223">So I'm going to hand over at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">this point, Tom Newton, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">Director of Social </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">Gaming, Gamesys. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="228"><span class="speakerName">Tom Newton</span>: Thanks, Matt. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="232">Hi, everyone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="234">So as Matt's just introduced me, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">my name's Tom Newton, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">I'm a director at Gamesys, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">I look after our social and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">mobile games business. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="243">So many of you probably have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">never heard of Gamesys. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="247">We were founded in 2001. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="249">We're based in London, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">in the UK. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="252">We have relatively quickly grown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">to be a market leader in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">what is arguably the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">competitive online gaming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">market in the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="260">We currently have about $5 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">billion in turnover annually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">and I think this says a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">bit about the stature of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">company today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="269">We were the first company that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">Facebook approached to launch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">real money gaming on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">Facebook last year. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="278">And we've grown from about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">10 people in 2011 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">to about 1,000 today. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="284">We started investing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">in social gaming &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">social and mobile, really &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">in 2011. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="289">And we've grown that team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">organically from, again, about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">3 or 4 people to just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">over 100 today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="295">We're currently operating five </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">cross-platform games &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">so iOS, Android, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">on Facebook &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">and we're even operating a game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">for PopCap and Electronic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">Arts, something we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">very proud of. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="309">So today, really, we're just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">going to talk about a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">of the uses, particularly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">within the social team. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="315">How we use the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">Cloud Platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="318">I always have trouble </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">saying that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="320">So we're going to focus, really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">on cloud storage, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">BigQuery, App Engine, and we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">going to talk a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">bit about the prediction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">API as well, and how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">we plan to use that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="330">So I get asked this a lot, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">particularly by developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="337">Why not build a cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">infrastructure? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">Why not have big data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">projects internally? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">And I sort of say, we do, but we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">use Google because we like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">to focus on building products, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">and trying to get away from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">building infrastructures. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="352">So really spending our time on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">trying to make really, really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">really fantastic games and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">products for our customers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="358">And so we can build with Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">because we always plan </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">for success, and success </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">means that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">going to need to scale. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="366">And obviously, Google are an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">expert in building excellent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">scalable services. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="371">We really love all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">the Google APIs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="375">Doing an integration with one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">of these Google services </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">really means that through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">these rich APIs, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">really use them as just a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">building block, and build a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">lot of interesting tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">around them. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="387">And that's something that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">think gives you a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">synergies when you start to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">integrate your own systems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">with the Google Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">Platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="394">And third, it's reliable. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="395">I think the less software that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">I need to run and to maintain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">and to monitor, the better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="402">I'd just like to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">sleep at night. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="403">Call me lazy, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">I enjoy sleep. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="407">And when we use Google Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">Platform, we just, for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">most part, don't need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">to worry about it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="412">We can trust that it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">going to do its job. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="415">So today, we're going to tell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">you a little bit about a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">game that we have, and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">really just to paint a picture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="423">of what these connected products </span><span class="line" data-startTime="423">look like &mdash; these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">connected games &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">how they work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="428">We're going to talk a lot about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="428">the importance of data. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="432">And then we're going to move on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">to talk a little bit about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">how we industrialize the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">learnings that we get from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">this data, and build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">tools that help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">us operate our business. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="441">So "Here Be Monsters" is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">pretty ambitious project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="445">It started about a year </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">and a half ago. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="448">It's a social game, but we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">trying to take it a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">of a step further and give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">it a bit of an RPG feel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="457">So it's an online MMO, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">building it for the web, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">we're also building it for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">Android tablets and the iPad. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="463">So it'll be launching on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">iPad first, and that should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">come in about early September. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="467">We're really excited about it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="468">So when it's out, definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">check it out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="472">So in Here Be Monsters, you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">got an entire world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="474">It's an isometric 2D game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="477">You've got an entire world that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">you can go and explore. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="480">And currently, I think &mdash; we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">in beta right now &mdash; currently, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">I think there's about 3,000 to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">3,500 unique distinct objects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">which exist within the game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="490">And so I think the point I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">trying to make here is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">Here Be Monsters is all about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">data, and we're just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">constantly pushing new items </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">that the players can run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">around the world and collect. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="501">And once they do collect all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">these items, they can combine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">them in really interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">ways to craft bigger and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="507">better items. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="508">So a very, very typical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">kind of RPG mechanic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="513">And why do they want to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">around the world and collect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">all these items and build all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">these interesting things? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">Well, they do it because they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">want to catch monsters. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="520">And in order to catch monsters, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">there's a trapping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">element to the game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="523">So you can build really, really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">interesting traps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="525">You can travel around to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">right parts of the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="528">You can put some bait </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">in your trap. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="530">And then periodically, you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">check your trap, and you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">hoping that you've caught the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">monster that you're after. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="537">So now I'll just show you really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">quickly what the game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">looks like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="548">So hopefully, you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">can see this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="553">We had a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">of a problem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">with the monitor earlier. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="555">That looks good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="556">OK, so here's "Here Be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="556">Monsters." That's my little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">character there running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">around. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="560">You can see a trap that I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">set here which is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">ready to check. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="563">But the point that I'm trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">make here is that the world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">is really big. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="567">This is just one isometric scene </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">that players can visit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">and run around and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">interact with. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="572">And everything is interactive. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="573">You can see a couple of players </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">down there, actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">sort of standing around. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="579">Some of them are probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="579">fishing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="580">I think we broke the game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">recently, so you can't see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">fact that they're fishing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="585">But all of the elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">are interactive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="586">So they can go around and pick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="586">up &mdash; for example, we can pick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">up some grass or a dandelion. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="592">We can go fishing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="594">There we go, we picked up some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">grass and some dandelions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="596">We put those in our backpack. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="599">And we can combine those. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="600">Again, we can take them back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">home, we can craft them into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">bigger and better items, and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">can carry on with the game. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="605">And the way that we lead players </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">through the game is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">really through the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">questing system. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="608">So players travel around the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">world, and they meet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">non-player characters. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="612">And when they meet those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">non-player characters, they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">given all sorts of different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">tasks that they need to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="616">So they start off very, very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">simple, and then they progress </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">and get more and more complex, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">meaning that you really need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">to get out there into the world, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">find all these items, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">discover them, and discover the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">recipes on how you make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">better and better items. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="629">Just to give you a sense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="629">of some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="631">artwork in the world &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">so this is the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="633">It's a game that's based on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">real world, and it's full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">of isometric scenes that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">you can visit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="639">So if I zoom in, all of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">little icons here, they all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">represent unique isometric 2D </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">scenes that players can visit, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">and they're full of different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">kinds of items. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="649">There are different trees, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">different butterflies, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">different flowers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="653">And I think the coolest thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">about the game, too, is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">the monsters are actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">all taken </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">from real human mythology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="661">So if you wanted to find a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">specific kind of monster that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">you know about, chances are that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">it's going to be in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="668">area that you would expect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="668">it to be in. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="669">But if you need to look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">it up, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">always go into the almanac. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="672">I'll just show you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="672">that as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="674">So the almanac &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">this is the dandelion pixie, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">which is one of the nicer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="677">looking monsters that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="677">go out and try and catch. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="680">But there's a lot of information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">within the almanac </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">that tells you all about all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">the different monsters. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="684">For example, a chimera, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">is probably something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">some people are familiar with, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">the different baits that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">might have to craft in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">order to trap them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="692">So hopefully, this is kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="692">making the point, there's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">ton of data in this game. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="696">And the strategy behind this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">game is that we built a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">interesting kind of CMS behind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">the scenes that allows us to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">push a lot of content on a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">weekly basis, because we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="708">expect that a lot of the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="708">engaged users are going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">tear through the content. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="712">So it's very, very important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">that if we want to keep them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">engaged, we need to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">constantly releasing new and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="716">better content for this game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="729">Great. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="729">So, all right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="731">So we've sort of painted a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="731">little bit of a picture. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="732">We've got a lot of players, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">they're running around, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">they're doing all these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">different activities. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="736">They can visit friends, they can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">send gifts, they can farm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">on their homesteads, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">can craft items, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">they can collect items. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="744">So what does this mean? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">Well, what it means is that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">generate a ton of events. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="749">There's a lot of raw data, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">and that raw data &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">I'd say five or six years ago, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">you probably wouldn't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">recorded every single little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">step that a player made and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">all of the different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">properties that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">go along with that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="763">But today, it's pretty much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">a necessity if you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">operate one of these games, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">and you want to operate it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">well and optimize it and run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">it as a solid business. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="772">But that means you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">going to generate a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">huge amount of data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="775">And just to give you an idea of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="775">the sorts of levels of data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">that we see &mdash; and to be honest, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">there are plenty of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="779">other companies that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="779">probably generating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">even more than this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="782">"Here Be Monsters" right now has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">got about 10,000 people in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">a limited beta on Facebook. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="788">And those 10,000 players are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="788">generating about a million </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">sessions a month, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">about 200 million </span><span class="line" data-startTime="794">unique events a month. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="795">So 200 million actions taken </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">by 10,000 daily actives. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="799">We've got other games currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">that are running. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="802">Game 2 there, launched about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="802">three months ago, has already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">got 150,000 people playing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">it every day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="807">They're generating about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="807">500 million events </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">every single month. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="814">And then one of our larger games </span><span class="line" data-startTime="814">is generating in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">billions of events </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">every month. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="821">All of this data goes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">into BigQuery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="823">And the reason why we really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">like BigQuery at Gamesys is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">that it's managed, so there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">almost nothing you need to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">to get set up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="833">It scales. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="835">I'm going to say this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">a lot today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="836">We really cannot integrate with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="836">a service where we think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">that it can't scale, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">BigQuery definitely has a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">of power and can do the sorts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">of things that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">want to do with it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="846">And then also the fact that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="846">you're just writing SQL. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="849">Anybody can write a BigQuery, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="849">and that's pretty awesome, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">because our analysts don't like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">training days and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="854">sort of thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="856">Because they already know SQL, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">and they know it really well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">the transition is extremely easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">for them to go and start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">writing big, powerful queries. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="866">So to give you an idea of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">happens within our platform, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">every day, we've got all these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">players coming in, they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">playing the game, doing all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">these different things, having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="875">a lot of fun. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="876">And at night, we aggregate all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">of that events data into a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">couple of aggregated tables </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">just for convenience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="886">And then we also upload all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">the raw events into a table </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">within BigQuery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="895">So these aggregations, these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">aggregated tables, they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">there for convenience, but they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">help us drive, really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">just high level KPI reporting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="907">Just to give you an idea of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">couple of the tables that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">use fairly consistently across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">all of our games &mdash; and you may </span><span class="line" data-startTime="912">want to define different ones </span><span class="line" data-startTime="912">depending on the style of game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="914">or application &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="914">I mean, I think this applies to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="914">really any digital product. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="919">The first is profiles. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="920">So profiles, when they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="920">aggregated at night, you get a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">picture of what that user's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">state looked like at the end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">of the day, and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">fairly important. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="928">Sessions are fairly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">self-explanatory. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="930">They're essentially aggregated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">groups of events that match a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="934">user's play periods. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="937">And then we have transactions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="939">So transactions, obviously, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">are really important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="941">They drive the entire </span><span class="line" data-startTime="941">business. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="942">We want to know when did someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">make a purchase, very, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">very specifically, so that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">can go and really dig into, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="950">what motivated them to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="950">make that purchase? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">What did they do once they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">bought that virtual currency </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">or virtual good? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="957">How did they spend that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="957">within the game? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">What sort of activities did they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">engage with afterwards? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">It's really, really important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">that we dig in and understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="965">the purchasing behavior and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="965">behavior of our players, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="969">especially around the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="969">time of purchase. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="973">So hopefully, I've been able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="973">to paint a little bit of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="975">picture about what the game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="975">is, what kind of data it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="979">generates, the volumes of data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="979">that it generates, and that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="984">effectively every night update </span><span class="line" data-startTime="984">a number of data sets and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">tables within BigQuery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="991">So now that our data is in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="991">BigQuery, and you understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="995">the structure of that data, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="995">we're going to talk just a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="997">little bit about how &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">this is probably one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">simplest things you can do, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">fact, once your data is in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">BigQuery, and that is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1005">integrate that data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1005">with spreadsheets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1009">So, to build, essentially, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">reports of various shapes and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">sizes using Apps Script. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1015">This is incredibly easy to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1018">So using some of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1018">aggregated tables, on our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">teams, we build up dashboards. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1025">So we build relatively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1025">complicated workbooks that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">everybody on the team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">has access to. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1031">We look at a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1031">different metrics. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1035">We slice them in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1035">different ways. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1037">But probably the simplest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">would be a simple daily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">dashboard, and these really just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">help to highlight high </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">level KPI trends. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1046">And they often give you a bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">of a hint that just says, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1050">maybe we want to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1050">and look at this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1052">Retention looks like it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1052">little bit off for these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">players, or something's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">happened, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1056">our active user base &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">the retention dropped over the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">next week, and we want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1060">figure out why. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">And other people may want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">to look at things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1064">like conversion rates. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1065">So when we have brand new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1065">installs coming in on a given </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">day or given week, we really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">want to monitor the health of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1070">those users, compare them to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1070">other install days, other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1073">install weeks, so that we feel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1073">comfortable continuing with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">our acquisition spend. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1080">So now what I'll do is I'll just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1080">show you very quickly for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">the developers that are in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">room, of which I would imagine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">there are lots of you, I'll just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">show you how easy it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">to basically integrate BigQuery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">with spreadsheets, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">and to build reports this way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1096">So what I've done here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">I've just given you &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">within our games, we tend to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">have lots of different types </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1102">of funnels. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1103">So funnels, really, are just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">sequential events, and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">fact that we've got all this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">raw events data in BigQuery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">pretty much means we can define </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">any funnel we want. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">And that's pretty significant, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">and pretty powerful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1116">So let's just take this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1116">as an example. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1120">I've called it the elementary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">quest funnel analysis. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1123">But let's say we've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">a product manager. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1125">This week, they're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">focus on a very specific part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">of the game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1129">They think they've seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">a bit of drop-off. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1131">They've asked one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">analysts to go away and do a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">bit of ad hoc analysis. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1134">They've identified the issue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1137">And now what they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">want to see is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1138">As they make these iterations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1138">daily, and they keep pushing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">these releases, we want to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">that data in front of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">product manager. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1145">And a product manager doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1145">necessarily know how to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">into BigQuery and write a bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">of SQL, nor should they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">have to, because our analysts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">can simply create a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1153">workbook that's specifically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1153">for that product manager, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">define a query that can go away </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">and look at those tables, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1159">pull out all the interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1159">events that matter, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1162">summarize that into a sample </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1162">little dashboard. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1167">So how do you do that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1168">Well, to be honest, I didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1168">even know this stuff existed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">about nine months ago until I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">did a little bit of digging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">around and had a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">chats with Matt. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">But we've started using it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">heavily, and it's fantastic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1179">So you need to go into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1179">script editor to start working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1183">with Apps Script, and you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1183">find it under the Tools menu. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1185">So if you go to the Tools menu </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1185">and you go down here, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">script editor thing &mdash; if you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">ever wondered what that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">is, well, for those you that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">new to Apps Script, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1194">will open the script editor. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1195">And what you'll see here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">essentially JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1197">So Apps Script is basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1197">JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1200">And I'll just show you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1202">So this function here is just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1202">a very simple function which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">takes a query, which is just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">our SQL statement. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">I've put it in a comment down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">here, just to illustrate the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">complexity of the query. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1218">So this is a big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1218">complex query. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1219">It's going query about 200 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1219">million rows of data, and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">going to pull the results back, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">and it's going to put </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1227">that into our spreadsheet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1230">So how do you connect to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">BigQuery within Apps Script? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1234">Well, it's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1234">really simple. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1235">So here's a little convenience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">function that I wrote, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1238">is run query async, and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1238">really just broken down into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">three parts. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">So you've got this job </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">description here, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">very, very simple to set up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1246">And you can see that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1246">passing in our SQL statements. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1249">That's just a string that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">represents our SQL statement. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1252">You can then insert the job. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1254">So again, very, very simple. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1256">That's basically passing it off </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1256">to BigQuery and asking it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">to actually execute the query. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1260">And then all we do here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1260">is we just wait. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1263">We wait asynchronously, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">and we pull to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1265">if the job is complete. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1267">And then finally, when the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">results come back, we go ahead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1269">and fetch them just here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1269">and then we return them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1274">And that's essentially it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1276">So if we run that now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1276">hopefully this will &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1281">oh, sorry. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1281">This is one other thing you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1281">do, which is, again, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1283">convenience, is you can very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1283">easily just add your own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1286">custom menus. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1287">So you can see this little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">bit of code here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1289">That's all that does. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1289">So I get a nice little menu </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">item here, and this button </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1293">here is hooked to my function. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1295">Now, the other thing I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1295">mention as well &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">when you're building up, say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">daily dashboards or monthly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1302">dashboards, a really nice, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1302">simple way to get them to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">automatically run every day </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">is with the triggers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1308">functionality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1309">So this little icon here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1309">is the triggers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1313">To set up a new periodic trigger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1313">is extremely simple. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1317">Just go here and add a trigger, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1317">select the function </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">that you want to run, select </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">that you want it to be time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">driven, and there's a bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">of different options here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1327">So if this was a daily thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1327">that we wanted to refresh, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1330">would select daily, select the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1330">time we want it to run &mdash; so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1333">let's say we want it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1333">to run at 6:00 AM. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1334">We'd save that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1336">And now this spreadsheet's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">to automatically run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">that query for you at between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">6:00 and 7:00 AM. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1342">And so when you get it in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1342">morning, just pop open your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">workbook or open your phone, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">that funnel announcement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1347">is right there for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1347">you to look at. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">So let's just run the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">query very quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1352">Again, so this isn't a massive, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1352">massive data set, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1354">it's pretty big. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1356">And obviously, we're running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">this for our other games as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1358">well on much larger data sets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1359">This is about 200 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">million rows. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1361">So it's running, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1361">there we go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1364">So all of our interesting data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1364">that we were interested in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1367">about these different events </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1367">throughout our funnel, we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1370">tracked that, we split it by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1370">Tier 1 countries and non-Tier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">1, which is basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">English speaking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1374">and not English speaking. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1376">And we can see the results </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1376">visualized on our graph below. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1379">So that's how easy it is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1379">really, to take these massive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">data sets and actually produce a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">workbook, a spreadsheet that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">everybody knows how to access, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">and really get this important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1391">data in front of the teams </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1391">that are working on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1393">the games every day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1404">Great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1404">So we're going to switch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1404">gears a little bit now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1407">Again, that was a relatively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1407">simple example of what you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1409">do to hook BigQuery up to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">spreadsheets using Apps Script. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1415">There's a lot of other things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">you can do with Apps Script as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">well, so definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">have a look at it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1418">You can convert those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1418">spreadsheets to PDFs, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1421">email them to everybody. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">There's loads and loads you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">can do with them, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1424">definitely have a good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1424">look at that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1427">So now we're going to talk a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">little bit about how we build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1429">tools that kind of industrialize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1429">our learning. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1432">So we do do a ton of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1432">ad hoc analysis. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1435">We've got four or five analysts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1435">on our team that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">looking at our data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">every single day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1444">All right, that's what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">we've looked at. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1446">But the next thing we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">to look at is how we take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1448">those learnings and how we build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1448">tools that also interact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">with our data to kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">automate optimizations that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1458">see or automate tooling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1458">that can help us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1462">And so the first one we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">to talk about is a tool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1464">that is called Mailman. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1466">It's an engagement tool, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1466">it's built with App Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1474">So App Engine &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">we get asked this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">a lot as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1476">Why do we use App Engine? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1478">If anybody wants to go for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1478">beer later, I can talk to for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1481">about two hours on all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1481">reasons why I love App Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1483">App Engine is fantastic, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">integrating it with other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1488">Google services really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1488">make it even better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1491">But just simply, if we had to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">boil it down into a couple of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1494">points, it's super productive, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1494">right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1497">So I think I've said this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1497">already today, but we just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">like to focus on the problems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">and leave some of the heavy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1504">lifting to the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1504">Cloud Platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1507">And it's pretty powerful, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1507">particularly for small teams </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1509">that are trying to grow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1509">their businesses. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">You need every minute of every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">day on your products, not on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1513">infrastructure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1515">The deployment model's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1515">really cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1517">All of our guys love the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">deployment model. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1518">We can't actually take advantage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1518">of it as much as, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">say, if you had a website that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">you could, but we still make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1524">very, very good use of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1526">And then, of course, scale. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1527">We mentioned this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1527">once or twice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1529">We're going to mention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1529">it again. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1530">We cannot integrate with any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1530">service that we don't believe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">can scale along with us, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">we're always planning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1535">for success. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1535">We're expecting big numbers, big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1535">traffic, big concurrency. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1539">And if we're going to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1539">tools that run alongside our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1541">games that our games platform's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1541">going to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">speaking to at that sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">level, we have to make the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1545">right decisions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1546">And we feel very, very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1546">good about our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1547">choice of App Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1548">We've been working with it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1548">for about two years now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1552">So Mailman, just to dig into &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1554">this is just one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1554">tools we've built. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1555">We've built a number. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">We decided to focus on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">these two today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1559">So Mailman really is an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">automated delivery mechanism </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">or delivery tool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">for messaging. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1567">It's really important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1567">within our games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1569">People aren't playing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">our games all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1570">day, and that's healthy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1572">Some of them actually do, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1572">we're worried about, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">most of them don't, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1578">Most of them are normal people, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1578">and they come and go, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1580">and they play a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1580">different games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1582">And so when we do our ad hoc </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1582">analysis, and we see the sorts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1587">of drop-off points that maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1587">are concerning to us, and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">see where people get stuck </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">within the game, sometimes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1593">it's too late for us. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">And because they got stuck in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1594">the game at a certain point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1597">that we've now identified, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1597">they're not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">planning on coming back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1602">And so this is when we have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1602">basically reach out to them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1604">And this is just one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">case, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">We reach out to our players all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">the time through email, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1609">through push notifications and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1609">Facebook notifications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1613">So the logical components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1613">of Mailman are lists. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1618">Lists really answer the who. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1619">So the powerful bit about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">lists is that lists are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1624">basically groups of message </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1624">recipients, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1626">they represent players. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1628">And the list can be defined </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1628">with a query. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1631">So anything we can write a query </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1631">for, anything that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">turn up in our ad hoc analysis, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">we can just define a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1635">new list with a query. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1638">We use a little bit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1638">templating to make sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1640">we can use those same queries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1640">over and over daily, if they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">need to be refreshed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">daily, but it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1645">pretty powerful thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1648">And what actually happens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1648">technically under the hood </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">when one of those lists are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1650">created is that under the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">hood, we basically make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">a query to BigQuery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1658">And for those of you that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">familiar with App Engine, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">store the results, no matter how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">large they are &mdash; we store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">those results in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">the Blobstore. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1666">And so jobs, when they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">actually run &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">the messaging jobs &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1670">this is really where we take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1670">advantage of App Engine's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">scale and parallelism, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">we make use of the MapReduce </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1680">API and the pipeline APIs, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1680">that means that essentially, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1683">we can spin up a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1683">instances to go away and map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1686">over the results that we got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1686">back from our query. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">And so jobs really represent &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">if lists are the who, then jobs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">really answer the what, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1695">the when, and the where, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1695">what happens when this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1698">MapReduce job runs across all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1698">these instances that just sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">of fire up magically is that for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">every single recipient and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1703">message that we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1703">send, we enqueue a task. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1706">And so sometimes we run huge, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1706">huge volumes of messaging, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1709">whether it's email, push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1709">notifications, Facebook </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1712">notifications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1713">You could very easily run a job </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1713">one night that's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1715">be to millions of users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1717">And App Engine can handle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">that pretty seamlessly. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">And one of the things you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">find when you start working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">with App Engine is that there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">so many great APIs and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">services that are made available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">to you when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1728">build on that platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1730">And so one of the ways in which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1730">we &mdash; there's a feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">called ETA, and ETA essentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">means that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1734">specify the earliest time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1734">that you want a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">specific task to run. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1737">And so we actually use the ETA </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1737">feature within the task use to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">make sure that part of our query </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">on that list, one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1745">columns of data that comes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1745">back for every row </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1746">is actually a hint. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1748">And it hints to us what time of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1748">day we should actually send </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">out a message to make sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">we get the highest chance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1754">that a user's going to respond </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1754">to that and engage with that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">message and come back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">to the game. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1758">And so we use a lot. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1760">And obviously, we deliver across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1760">the different channels. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1764">So that's Mailman. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1767">The next one we're going to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1767">to you about &mdash; this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">the last one &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">is called Cobra, and Cobra is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">also built on App Engine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1776">So Cobra's really interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1776">because as you can imagine, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">once your game's mature &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">you launch a game, it's out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">there for three or six months. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1783">You're doing loads </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1783">of optimizations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1784">You really start to push it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">It's getting bigger and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">bigger and bigger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1787">And slowly, what you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">happening is that you can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1790">just address users that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1790">are, say, right on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1793">the bleeding edge. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1794">And you can't really just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1794">address users that are on day </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1796">one or day two or day three. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1798">But there's lots of different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1798">strategies that you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">deploy to make sure that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">have the best chance at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1805">monetizing users at all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1805">the different stages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1808">of their life cycle. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">And so that's what Cobra </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">does for us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1811">Cobra is basically a pricing and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1811">promotions engine which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1814">aware of players' profiles. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1818">Cobra is loosely integrated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1818">with BigQuery, but is also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1821">heavily integrated with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1821">our games platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1824">And the other thing that it does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1824">is it acts as a middleman </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1827">through all the transactions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1828">No matter what the platform, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">all of our transactions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">securely flow through Mailman, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">are authenticated and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1836">validated, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1836">they proceed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1839">So if we think about the pricing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">and promotions engine, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">what's actually happening today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">is a very iterative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1844">process where we go away and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1844">we do a lot of ad hoc </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1846">analysis, and from that ad hoc </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1846">analysis, we come up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1851">strategies. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1852">So different pricing and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1852">promotion strategies that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1855">want to basically program into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1855">Cobra, and then deploy. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">And when someone actually does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">interact with one of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1863">offers, or a promotion, or a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1863">response to maybe a subtle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">change in some of the pricing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">we record that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1869">So they make a purchase, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1869">tagged with a bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1872">information about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1872">configuration that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">responded to, and that flows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">down into our games platform, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1878">which, again, nightly, comes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1878">back up into BigQuery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1881">And so we do a lot of manual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">iterative processes there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1884">And that works really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1884">really well. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">But one of the next things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">we're looking at is how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1889">we can use something called the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1889">Prediction API, and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1891">is another from Google which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1891">I'm told is really, really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">heavily used internally, and not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">used that much externally. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1898">But we definitely have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1898">a use case for it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1901">So just at a super high level, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">because we're running out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">time, the Prediction API kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">of has two functions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1911">If you have a model &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1912">so you've got a lot of raw data, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1912">which obviously we do, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">and many of you, I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">imagine, have as well &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">and you think that if you did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">some analysis on that data, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1923">you might be able to come up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1923">with some statistically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">significant indicators </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">of an outcome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1930">So for us, within Cobra, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">might be, this user's profile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1934">looks like this right now. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1937">Which type of offer do I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1937">they're most likely to convert </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1941">with, or to convert on? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1945">So basically, you just put </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1945">a bunch of data in cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">storage, you point that at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">the training endpoint. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1950">Prediction will suck up all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1950">the data, will train </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">the model for you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1953">And when it's complete, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1953">actually query that model. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1955">So you can query that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1955">statistical model with, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1958">essentially, what would be a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1958">row of data &mdash; so a row of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">these features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1962">And that would try and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">predict what that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1963">example value might be. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1967">So Cobra with Prediction. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1969">You can kind of see how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1969">that would work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1970">And so the way in which we might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1970">use it, or one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1973">ways in which we might use it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1973">is to just help us train on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1979">our financial data, train on our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1979">profiles data, and try and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1983">help us make even better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1983">decisions about what kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">offers to surface to players </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">based on where they are in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1991">their lifetime. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1993">And that's a pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1993">powerful thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1994">So that's something we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1994">experimenting with, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1996">hopefully, maybe next year, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1996">can come back in and talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1999">about how that went. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2002">So just to sort of recap, my big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2002">thing is, we've grown the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">social team at Gamesys from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">about 4 people sitting in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">little hallway to 100 people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">that occupy most of a floor. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2015">And I think one of the ways in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2015">which we've done that is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2019">we try and stand on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2019">shoulders of giants, and not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2023">try and replicate a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2023">lot of work that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2024">can be done by others. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2026">And these are fantastic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">products. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2028">And if you invest the time into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2028">understanding how they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2031">work and what they can do for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2031">you, you'll spend less time on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2034">all the boring, painful stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2036">And you'll really be able to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2036">at your data, build really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2039">cool tools, and focus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2039">on your game, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2042">which I think is paramount. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2045"><span class="speakerName">Matt Mcneill</span>: Great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2046">Thanks Tom. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2052">I hope you got a sense of some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2052">of the insight that data is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2056">really bringing to gaming. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2058">I can see that I'm going to lose </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2058">another six months of my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2060">life when this game launches. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2063">But I think there's some trends </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2063">that I'm seeing across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">the industry, and one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">things I'd say is, every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">successful game company seems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">to have three components. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2073">The first is, obviously, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2073">technology, and that's often </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">the obvious one where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">people start. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2078">Hey, what technology, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2078">platforms do we choose? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">But it's what you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">do on top of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2084">There's obviously the marketing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">department and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2086">user acquisition side &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2088">critically important. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">But the thing I think that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">somewhat neglected, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2091">there's a real opportunity, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2091">in this area of analytics. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2095">And one thing I'd say about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2095">the Google platforms &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2098">not just the Cloud Platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2098">that I'm involved in, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">actually all of Google's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">services &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2104">are helping game developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2104">and players </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">across a whole suite. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2109">The Cloud Platform, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2109">particularly, I think Tom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">really brought out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">what's important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2115">The platform is something, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2115">really, which we built for us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">here at Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2119">This is our success. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2121">And our strategy over the last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">18 months is to externalize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">that so that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">can use it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2126">So for me, personally, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">really exciting to see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">work people like Tom, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">actually many of you in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">audience, are really starting to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">do to build in a different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2136">way and into the future, not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2136">just of gaming, but technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">as a whole. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2141">So I know we've had a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">little bit of time. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2143">I can see we've got about four </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2143">minutes on the clock for Q&A. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2146">So we'll take some questions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2146">now, but if you've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">anything else, we'll be at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">the Cloud booth later on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2151">So any questions now? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2154">We'll take a few. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2157">Otherwise, we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2157">grab some beers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2160">Yeah, question here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2163"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Did you start with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2163">BigQuery, or did you have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">migrate over from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">another RDBMS? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">And if so, what challenges </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">did you see? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2171"><span class="speakerName">Tom Newton</span>: For this sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">work, to try and work with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2178">data sets that are this big, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2178">within some of the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2180">relational database services </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2180">that are out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">there, we really struggled. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2185">We really struggled. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2187">And we also spent a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2187">of time just trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2190">to make sure that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">we ran into so many different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">problems along the way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2195">Particularly, when we started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2195">some of these games, we never </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2198">thought we'd generate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2198">this much data. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2199">And at the time, we didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2199">really have a good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2203">understanding of the fact that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2203">recording all this data at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">this fine grain a level </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">was really necessary. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2208">And so when we started looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2208">at BigQuery, we were using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2212">MySQL databases, and that worked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2212">relatively well to a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2217">certain point. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2218">But also, it required a fair </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2218">amount of maintenance and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">human intervention and sysadmins </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">and experts with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2226">that technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2227">And we just want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2227">to make games. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2230">We don't want to have a bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">of guys on the team that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">constantly focused on trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">to maintain these pieces of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2236">software, not when there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2236">services like this that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2238">out there that you can leverage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2238">that just make life </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2240">that much easier &mdash; and to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2240">fair, are way more powerful, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">and come with fantastic APIs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2247">So I hope that answers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">your question. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2249">We can talk to you a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2249">more about it afterwards. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2250"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: I have one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2250">more for you, too, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">if I can get a chance. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2252"><span class="speakerName">Tom Newton</span>: Sure. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2253"><span class="speakerName">Matt Mcneill</span>: Yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2254"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2255">So you have these ETL processes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">that you're running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2258">at the end of the day </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2258">or something, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2260">And then basically, you're using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2260">all this infrastructure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2263">as a sort of [? all up ?] queue, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2263">and you have all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">services that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">run out of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2269">So I'm curious as to what were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">the technical reasons for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2274">new games that you're making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2274">that you didn't choose just to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2278">build the whole thing on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2278">Google Cloud Platform and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">avoid having your own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">servers right now? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">So were there lower latency </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">things, or some technological </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2287">things that were missing? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">Because then it would avoid </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">having to do the ETL extract </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2293">at the end, and then run your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2293">own App Engine processes, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">then extract that again out, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">and putting it back in. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2302"><span class="speakerName">Tom Newton</span>: So, sorry. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2302">The question is, why don't we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2302">build the games themselves on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2305">App Engine or on Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2305">Cloud Platform? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2307"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: What are the technical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2307">features that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2309">missing from there? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2310"><span class="speakerName">Tom Newton</span>: Well, for App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2310">Engine, for games that require </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2313">bidirectional socket </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2313">communication, you're not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">going to be able to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">that on App Engine. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2317">It's scaled at the moment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2317">not particularly well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2319">But now with Compute Engine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2319">coming along, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2321">absolutely no reason why you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2321">can't build an entire game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323">stack on the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2323">Cloud Platform. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2326">I think the thing to remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2326">is that we started building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2329">social games about 4 and 1/2 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2329">years ago, and built up a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2332">platform on another provider. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2335">And we've got a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2335">of code there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">We can leverage that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2338">We can build games </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2338">really, really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2339">quickly on that platform. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2341">But to be honest, I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2341">dying to find a game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2345">that sort of fits &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2347">maybe one of our next ones &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2347">that we can actually build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2348">with App Engine, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2348">it makes sense. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">If it doesn't require </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">bidirectional sockets. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2356"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: So two questions. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2357">What are you guys using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2357">to visualize the data? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2360">Is it all just spreadsheets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2360">with queries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2363">and put into a chart? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2364">Are you using any other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2364">tools to visualize it? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2368"><span class="speakerName">Tom Newton</span>: We kind of let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2368">people pick and choose what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2369">tools they want to use. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">So we have been fairly heavy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">users of Tableau in the past. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2376">Some of our analysts just like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2376">to work within Microsoft Excel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2379">sometimes, and they use the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2379">connector for Excel, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">do a lot of visualizations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">in there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">But for the most part, to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">honest, our core dashboards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2387">and some of our most, I'd say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2387">insightful information sits </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2394">within these dashboards that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2394">we put together for each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2396">product now. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2397">And a lot of them are ad hoc </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2397">analysis that are actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2399">done by the analysts, so they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2399">can choose how they want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2401">visualize it and then circulate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2401">it to the teams. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2406"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Hi. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2406">I was actually wondering if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2406">you can speak a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2409">about the predictive models that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2409">you were showing there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2414">It wasn't clear, at least to me, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2414">if that was something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">was done within the App Engine, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">or is that something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2418">that you're doing external? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2420">And what kind of tools are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2420">you using for that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2423"><span class="speakerName">Tom Newton</span>: Sure. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2423">So I kind of rushed through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2423">that, I apologize. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">The Prediction API is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">actually another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2428">API provided by Google. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2430">And we can talk a little bit &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2430">oh, we have to get offstage. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2433">[INTERPOSING VOICES] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2436"><span class="speakerName">Tom Newton</span>: I'll come and have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2436">a chat with you about that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2438"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: OK, yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2438">Sounds good. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2439"><span class="speakerName">Matt Mcneill</span>: OK, are we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">OK to have a chat at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2442">the booth maybe later? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2443">I'm just thinking that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2443">probably timed out here. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2445">But thanks, Tom. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2446">Thanks, everyone, for coming. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2447">And if you have any questions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2447">please come by the booth. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2450">[APPLAUSE] </span></p></div>
