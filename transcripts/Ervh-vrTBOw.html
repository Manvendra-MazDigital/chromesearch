<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="0"><span class="speakerName">Bill Luan</span>: Shanghai GDG a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">interesting developer community. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="4"><span class="speakerName">Susannah Raub</span>: I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">glad somebody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">has asked this question. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="6"><span class="speakerName">Reto Meier</span>: This is where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="6">the magic happens. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="7"><span class="speakerName">Jenny Murphy</span>: This is primarily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">a question and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">answer show, so if any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">of you out there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">would like to ask questions. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="19"><span class="speakerName">Ido Green</span>: Today in this GDL </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">episode, we speak a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">about the new Chromebook. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="23">And then I would love to dive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">more into new things that any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">web developer should know about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">Chrome Dev Tools and how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">they could leverage them and be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">more productive when they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">are building their next web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">app or mobile web app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="37">So without further ado, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">start and try to go &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">I have this short list of things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">that we could go and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">work on it together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="52">And here are the main ones. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="53">Of course, as you can see, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">it's a blog post that I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">going to publish later today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="57">But for now, let's just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">go and dive into it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="59">So the first thing that we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">today in Chrome &mdash; and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">basically, before we even start, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">I would love to offer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">web developers the opportunity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">to install Chrome Canary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">alongside their regular, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">stable Chrome. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="72">You could go and just Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">Chrome Canary, install it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="76">And when you're working on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">your development, I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">extremely encourage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">you to use it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="81">It will give you great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">capabilities in terms of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">having the greatest and latest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">features in the Dev Tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="88">And moreover, you could see how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">Chrome is going to look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">like in the next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">6 or 12 weeks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="94">So the first thing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">we have today &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">let's open Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">Dev Tools here &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">is the opportunity to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">a device emulation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="103">So it's true that in the past </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">we had this opportunity with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">other simulators that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">needed to install. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="109">For instance, the iPhone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">simulator on Mac or on any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">iOS, and then for Android with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">the simulators that work on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">Windows, Mac, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">others platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="118">But here, you have it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">inside the browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="120">So how you do that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">is you saw &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">or you didn't, but I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">make it a bit bigger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">so it will be easier. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="127">I opened the Chrome Dev Tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="129">Let me do this a big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">bigger as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="133">OK, so I'm going here to this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">button, clicking on it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="138">And now when I have the Setting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">opportunity, what I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">can do here is basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">override the functionalities. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="144">The main functionality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">that I could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">override is the user agent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="147">And that just allows me pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">easily to mimic any mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">device that I wish to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">or different browser. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="157">It's very, very convenient and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">efficient to see how your site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">or web app will look on, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">say, Android 2.3 or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">BlackBerry, and so on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="170">So that's the first thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="171">The other thing that is very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">cool is the device metric. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="175">You could now basically enter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">any device metric that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">want to check. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="179">But even more cool than that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">and you saw here, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">that it's just changing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="184">If you're overriding the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">user agent, it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">automatically fit it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="188">So if I'm working now on iPhone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">5, you could see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">it filled for me the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">device metric. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="192">And that's a great thing because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">it's just letting you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">work with the exact device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">that you wish and get the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">exact screen resolution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">that you have there. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="201">So that's one very cool feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">that we have today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="206">And basically, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">a ton of other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">features in the settings. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="208">So if you want to drill down it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">and see exactly what you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">getting there, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">in the new view. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="214">Another very important thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">is to emulate Touch Event. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="217">So if I'm clicking this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">checkbox, from now on, I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">get Touch Event. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="223">And specifically for mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">applications, this is very, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">very crucial. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="227">So we don't need to use what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">we used in the past, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">listening to an extra event and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">then have the ability to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">have Click Event and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">Touch Event. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="237">Here what we're doing is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">pretty straightforward. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="238">We're just emulating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">Touch Event. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="240">And from now on, our regular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">Chrome in our desktop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">environment will act and will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">fire those touch events. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="247">So that's another pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">cool new add-in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="252">Other things that we have in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">Chrome Dev Tools are actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">under the Experiments. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="260">And the experiments flag could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">be triggered on by just going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">to Chrome Flags. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="267">Let me open it and just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">show it to you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="269">So here, basically, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">seeing all the different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">experiments that you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">do today under Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="275">The list is very long, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">as you can see. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="277">And what I really like in it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">that if you search just for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">Dev Tools &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">tools, yeah &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">so enable Developer Tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">Experiments &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">and in my case, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">already enabled &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">you could see things &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">sorry, it's not enabled. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="297">Let me enable it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="300">Or even better, yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="302">Let me enable it here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="304">OK. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="305">And now if I go here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">and reload it &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">Yeah, basically I need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">to restart Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="319">Let me just get Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">restarted, the Chrome that I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">using, and I'll open it again. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="329">And then you'll be able to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">what did the flag that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">opened in the experiment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="335">Basically, we get another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">tab under the Dev Tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="337">And this tab will be all the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">experiments that you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">do, all the different features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">that you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">to use will be there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="344">So let me just show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">this to you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="349">Yeah, this is the wrong </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">program now. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="352">And here we go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="359">OK. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="359">Let's take this one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="365">And I'm opening it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="369">Yeah, so let's do another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">new screen share. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="375">And yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="378">So now, basically what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">you can see here &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">and let me try just to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">make it even larger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="384">OK, so you see here, I how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">have a new tab called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">Experiment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="389">And these experiments could give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">you the new things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">are going to be baked in Chrome, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">hopefully in that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">feature, and in that form and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">shape, maybe a bit differently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">in the future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="400">But at least you could play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">with them now and see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">how they look like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="404">Show CPU activity and timelines, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">or override the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">device geolocation, orientation, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">support SASS, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">lots of very, very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">cool things. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="415">The Snippets support is one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">the things that I really like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="417">And you could actually drive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">into JSON objects and see them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">in a very nice format in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">the console today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="423">So that's something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="423">we should open. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="427">And another very important thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">that I see more and more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">web developers are using these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">days is the ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">to disable the cache. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="435">So if you are working now, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">definitely don't want to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">miserable and try to figure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">out if it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">cache resource or not. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="443">Probably at the beginning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">of your development, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">prototyping, you want just to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">make sure that the cache is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">disabled, and each and every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">time that you're hitting the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">server, you're getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">the latest version. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="453">Just check this option, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">and you are a good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="459">Other cool things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">you could do here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">enable source map. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="463">Source map is the option </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">to work with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">original form of the file. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="468">So let's say that you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">in your build system a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">notification for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">your JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">or some other phase. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="475">Let's say, if you're working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">with Dart and you have it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">compiled to JavaScript, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">basically with source map, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">could debug with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">original code base. </span></p>
