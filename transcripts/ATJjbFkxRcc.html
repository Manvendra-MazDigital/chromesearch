<p><span class="line" data-startTime="0"> MUCHNICK: Aviary is a company that creates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">multimedia online editing software. Whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">you want do image editing, vector editing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">audio editing, or more right in your browser, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">we provide the software to do it. Originally, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">Aviary started with a company called worth1000.com </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">which is a competition site where artists </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">can compete in fun image editing contests. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="23">And we created software to help serve the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">needs of that community and realized it could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">expand from there so that anyone can do image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">editing online. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="30"> What is your extension about? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30"> MUCHNICK: Aviary's Chrome extension allows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">anyone to capture a screenshot of any web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">page your are on, quickly and easily right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">from within Chrome. You can then mark it up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">using Aviary's editor &mdash; let say add arrows, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">any kind of text mark up, and you can crop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">it, rotate it around, do anything you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">with it, and then quickly share it with your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">friends. We're hoping to extend the usefulness </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">of the extension, so that it can capture full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">page content not just what's on the screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">natively. Additionally, we have a few other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">plans to make it easier to edit images directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">off of any web page you're on. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="60"> How did you create the screenshot functionality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">of your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64"> MUCHNICK: Our extension takes a screenshot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">of the page and makes it editable on aviary.com. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="67">To capture the screenshot, we use Chrome's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">capture visible tab method. To make it available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">to most of the Flash base Aviary tools, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">upload the image data to aviary.com via XML </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">HTTP request. For one of the tools, we create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">a local conduit to make the image data directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">available to the Flash application without </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">uploading it to aviary.com at all. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="89"> What got you interested in Google Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">extensions? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94"> MUCHNICK: What got us interested in Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">extensions was really how &mdash; first of all, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">quickly Chrome works and how smoothly all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">of Aviary's tools operate on it. We've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">using Chrome since day one because it really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">enables our development to go so smoothly. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="105">We work with web pages all the time and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">really do a lot of screen capture and mark </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">up internally in our office. So for us to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">now take that Chrome extension and provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">it to our user base was a no-brainer. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">additionally, if it encourages Aviary's users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">to get a better experience because they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">using the Chrome browser, well that's a &mdash; that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">a huge win for us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="126"> What was your experience developing Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">Chrome extensions? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129"> MUCHNICK: Our experience developing Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">extensions was &mdash; was great, it was extremely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">simple to develop and deploy. And we love </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">the fact that once you developed it, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">no sandbox to hold you back. You simply put </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">it up on Google's website and it is immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">updated and deployed for all your users. When </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">you're stuck in a sandbox it can really cripple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">your development and rapid innovation. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">we're super happy that Google recognizes that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="151"> How did your vision evolve as you were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">working on your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155"> MUCHNICK: The product evolved the entire </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">time we were working on the extension. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">had to resign ourselves to the fact that certain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">elements weren't necessarily complete in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">API. But we were able to find workarounds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="163"> What were some challenges you faced when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">writing your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167"> MUCHNICK: There were some issues that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">had to cope with when developing our extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">and I think we came up with some innovative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">solutions. For example, trying to build out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">a menu for &mdash; when someone clicks on that browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">action icon, we had to come up with that ourselves </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">and actually simulate a menu pop-up. Additionally, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">we had two things; we really had to simulate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">full page screen capture, so we came up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">a way of rolling down the page and taking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">snapshots as we went using JavaScript and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">then reassembling it. And lastly, we had to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">do some filter clean up on some of the JPEG </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">full page screen capture. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="200"> What do you think about Google Chrome's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">decision to use CSS, HTML, and JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">as the basis of its extension framework? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208"> MUCHNICK: We love Chrome's decision to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in creating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">extensions. It makes it so much simpler for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">everyone on our development team to pick up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">and run with. Additionally, it seems like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">this method means the browser is free to operate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">without additional bloat prior to the extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">being invoked. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="224"> How many times have you updated your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224"> MUCHNICK: We've updated our extension twice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">so far and the experience was fantastic. Once </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">we figured out how to get the manifest correctly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">uploaded it was a snap and it was instantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">deployed and available for our users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="236"> How did you promote your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236"> MUCHNICK: To promote our extension we updated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">our user base on our own blog and newsletter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">and shared it with relevant tech blogs. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">also plan to promote it in context within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">our existing product set. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="248"> What advice can you give someone before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">starting to work on a Google Chrome extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253"> MUCHNICK: If you're working on a Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">extension, consider the overall architecture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">of your extension before you begin. Especially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">how you will divide up responsibilities and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">communicate between the background page, content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">scripts, and more. </span></p>
