<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="70"><span class="speakerName">Diane Greene</span>: Thank you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">for that introduction. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="73">She went further than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">I suggested she go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="78">So how did I manage to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">do these things? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">What I thought I would do is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">take you on a whirlwind tour </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">of my life and try and highlight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">where I thought I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">learned valuable things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="92">And I grew up sailing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">racing sailboats. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="97">And when you race a boat, first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">you have to build a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">team, and you have to get your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">team all aligned on a single </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">goal, which is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">win the race. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="108">And then you need your strategy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">to win the race. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="111">You have to understand what the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">wind's doing, understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">what the currents are doing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">and pay attention to your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">competitors. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="119">And if your competitors surprise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">you or you get a wind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">shift, you have to immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">react and handle that and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">continue winning the race. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="129">And the last thing is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">engineering around sailing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="136">You have to prepare your boat. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="137">It has to be ready to go fast. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="139">Then you have to tune it while </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">on the race course to keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">going fast. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="144">And I think that's what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">led me to train. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="147">I trained as a mechanical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">engineer and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">then a naval architect. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="153">I came out to the Bay Area </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">to San Francisco </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">for my first job. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="157">And the first thing I was given </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">to do was analyze some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">mooring, a mooring for an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">offshore oil platform that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">used for firefighting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="168">And there was a big Fortran </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">program that looked like it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">was the way to model this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="175">And so that's when I learned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">how to program. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="178">And it was just this incredibly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">powerful tool, software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="187">You could do anything with it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="189">Got pretty excited about it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="191">Was not very excited about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">sitting inside behind a desk. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="195">I really came to the Bay Area </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">for the windsurfing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="199">And so I quit that job and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">moved to Hawaii where I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">I've had perhaps one of my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">favorite periods of my life. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="209">I lived sort of in a commune </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">where we were exploring. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="214">Windsurfing was sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">of an early </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">microcosm of the tech industry. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="220">We were just inventing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">all kinds of things &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">new sails, high aspect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">sails, new shapes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">of boards, new materials. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="228">And all we did was build and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">test this equipment every day. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="233">It was really tremendous. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="234">And from there, I went and ran </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">engineering for Windsurfing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">International. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="239">That was the company that had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">the patent on the windsurfer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">which also taught me how abused </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">patents can be, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">they tried to control a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">rapidly expanding industry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">with their patents. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="255">I left that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="256">Well, all this time, I continued </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">to study software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="259">I went back up to the Bay Area </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">and enrolled in a graduate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">program in computer science </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">at UC Berkeley. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="266">Berkeley was a pretty happening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">place at that point. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="271">The grad students had a lab </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">full of brand new Sun </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">workstations that were based on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">this Unix, a relatively new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">open operating system. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="282">Richard Stallman, who wrote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="282">the GPL license, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">was hanging out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="287">I got to see the first graphical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">user interface, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">it was just very exciting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="294">And I knew it's what I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="294">wanted to keep doing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="296">I did still yearn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">for adventure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="299">I've always really loved </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">adventure, so I took a brief </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">interlude and used my computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">skills to be the computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">expert on a marine archaeology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">expedition in Sipan where we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">excavated a Spanish galleon </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">and found gold. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="318">And then I came back to the Bay </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">Area and went to work at a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">succession of companies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">in the tech industry. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="327">The first one was Sybase, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">I really got hit over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">the head with the value of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">having engineers across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">companies work together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="339">I made friends with an engineer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">at Sun, it turned out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">he was a windsurfer, and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">spend a few months windsurfing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">and writing software and were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">able to get sort of an order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">of magnitude performance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">increase in the Sybase system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">running on Sun. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="354">And I really used that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">when I built VMware. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="360">All three companies were quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">an education in how important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">it is to embrace change and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">always go forward, invest in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">the future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="372">Sybase didn't want to rework </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">their system to support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">symmetric multiprocessing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">processing, and that's sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">why Oracle eclipsed them. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="382">I went to work at Tandem that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">had the world's best database </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">management system, but it ran </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">on proprietary hardware and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">proprietary operating system. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="392">And it was too hard to see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">business model for moving to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">commodity open systems, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">they sort of sailed into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">oblivion, getting bought by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">Compaq and then by HP. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="406">And then I went to work for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">SGI, which was a pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">aggressive tech company at that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">point in time and worked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">on interactive television, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">which was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">really exciting project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="417">But again, the internet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">was happening and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">was starting at SGI. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="427">But instead, the founder of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">SGI, Jim Clark, left and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">founded Netscape, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">a number of us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">left and started companies. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="434">And that's when I finally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">just decided </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">to stick with startups. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="439">And so I did two successive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">smaller startups. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="444">They both had great visions. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="446">I would say they maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">executed too early. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="449">Nice financial outcomes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="450">The first one was streaming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">video over the internet, low </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">bandwidth, because there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">wasn't much bandwidth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="457">And the second was internet ad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">serving, interestingly enough. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="462">At that point I took a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">time off and decided to found </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">VMware, which was based on some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">work my husband was doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">at Stanford around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">virtualization. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="479">And there's a few things I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">kind of relate to what we did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">at VMware to what I had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">already learned. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="486">For instance, Sun Microsystems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">introduced these workstations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="491">People loved these workstations, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">and then brought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">their servers into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">the companies. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="495">And at VMware we used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">the same strategy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="498">We had a workstation software. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="501">People loved our workstation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">software, and then when we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">came out with the server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">product, were pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">quick to adopt it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="508">We did amazing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="510">Our engineers worked with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">the hardware vendors. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="512">They worked with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">chip vendors. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="514">They worked with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">storage vendors. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="516">And then we worked with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">all of those vendors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">to take it to market. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="520">And I'm just a huge believer in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">collaboration in the industry. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="524">And it was really effective for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">VMware, but it was always </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">hard to convince other companies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">to trust us and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">partner with us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="532">But I think we always won, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">jointly, together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="537">And then the last thing was just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">sort of how to adapt, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">to embrace change. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="542">My job changed considerably from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">zero to sort of 6,000, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">7,000 people the company </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">was when I left. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="550">And it's just sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">recognizing, OK, this isn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">working and constantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">sectioning out parts of my job </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">that I just didn't have time for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">anymore and hiring someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="564">to do those things. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="567">VMware was just a totally fun </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">adventure, building it with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">all those people and seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">the impact that it had. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="577">And what I would say is, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">not so important how. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="584">There's just sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">an infinite number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="586">of ways to do things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="588">But when you see something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">you're very interested </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">in, that you think it can have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">some real impact, the thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">that's important is to codify </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">that vision, see that vision, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="603">enjoy the adventure of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="603">building that vision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="606">And if you do enjoy it, it makes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="606">it fairly easy to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">fearless about it. </span></p>
