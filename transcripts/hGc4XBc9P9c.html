<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="0"><span class="speakerName">Erik Kay</span>: Hi, everyone, my name is Erik Kay. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">is Aaron Boodman. And we're really excited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">to be here for launching Chrome Extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">into beta after a year of hard work. So, 15 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="18">months ago when Chrome was first launched, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="18">one of the first things we heard from our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">users was asking us about extensions. And, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">in fact, it's the oldest open issue in our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="28">bug database, issue 18th. So, it got filed, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="28">literally, minutes after we launched. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">FIT was soon filled with hundreds &mdash; a hundred </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">comments or more of people saying, “Yes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">plus 1, me too.” You know, all the really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">helpful comments that, you know, that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">really want this. So, after it got a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">bit out of hand, we locked down the bug for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">further comments and finally said, “Yes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">okay. We’re working on extensions.” </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54"> BOODMAN: Somebody commented in the times </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">since we opened this up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="61"> KAY: Uh-oh. Well, so today, I'm glad to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">say that we're finally marking the bug fixed. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="74">So, when we announced that we were starting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">it, we got a lot sort of surprise reactions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">from people saying that, “Not only don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">you have extensions, but you haven't even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">started them yet.” Like, and the reason </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">that reaction was there was because a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">of pioneering work that Firefox and the Mozilla </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">community have done to really make extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">to be unexpected feature for the browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="94">So, it's now something that people demand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">and people want in browsers. However, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">problem with extensions is that when you build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">them, they really depend on all the lowest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">level parts of the browser. So, when we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">developing Chrome before we launched, lots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">of stuff was moving around. It was pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">chaotic and it wasn't really a good place </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">for us to start building extensions. It wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">until we released, that things got a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">bit more stabilized, that we really had a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">solid foundation to start building on. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">one of the interesting side effects of waiting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">the way we did, was that we were open sourcing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">public from day one. With that means is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">our very first design document about extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">was published from the Internet directly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="138">It was about a year ago in November. And since </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">then, we've been continuing to publish updates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">and examples and sample code and get feedback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">from the community, which helped keep us on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">the right track. One of the other interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">side effects of this is that a lot of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">in the audience probably got much earlier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">access to the code than you would have otherwise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">gotten. And in fact, the first extension that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">was written outside of Google was written </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">literally hours after we checked in the code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">that enabled it. It's been really exciting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">to work this closely with the community and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">we're really excited to keep working that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">way going forward. So, when we started designing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">Chrome Extensions, how do we start? We started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">with Chrome’s design principles and said, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">“How can we make extensions that fit into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">that?” Well, first, basically, we built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">on the open Web. We worked hard to make them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">Webby, this makes some fun and easy to develop. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="188">People can use their existing skills and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">grows with the Web platform. We kept the UI </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">streamlined. Chrome is all about wrapping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">powerful functionality and a streamlined user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">interphase. We believe that a fast browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">enables richer set of applications than could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">be done before, and keeps people more productive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="212">And that's especially important today because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">we're all spending a lot more time in front </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">of our browsers. Not only are we spending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">more time but we're doing lots of things at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">same time. We got a lot of Tabs and Windows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">opened. So, it's important that the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">remains stable. You don't want it to crash </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">and lose all your work, and so it's important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">that a single extension can't take down your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">browser. Further today, we're doing many more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">of our more sensitive activities online as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">well, whether it's just email or paying bills </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">or doing your taxes. It's important that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">browser stays secure. So, an extension that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">insecure shouldn’t be able to compromise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">this core security of the browser itself. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="250">So, what are extensions anyway? Extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">are just Zip files that are collections of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">Web pages and their associated resources, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">like, images and CSS files. So, if you remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">one thing from today's presentation, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">should be it. Extensions are just Web pages. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="267">And a lot of really cool things fall out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">this as a result. First, extensions are really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">easy to write. It's easy as writing a Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">page. If you're a Web developer, you get to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">reuse all your existing skills and knowledge. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="276">You can use all of the powerful tools that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">you’re used to using to develop Web pages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">to build extensions. You can also take advantage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">of the largest developer community in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">world for any platform. The Web platform has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">more developers than any other platform. On </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">top of that with Chrome, you can take advantage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">of future looking technologies. Things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">are &mdash; that are &mdash; that normally wouldn’t necessarily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">see as much of in the WildWeb, HTML5, Workers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">Canvas, video, Web sockets, things from WebKit, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">CSS3, you know, reflections and gradients, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">lots of cool stuff that we take for granted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">on the Chrome team, but maybe you're out seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">in the WildWeb. And you get to depend on having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">lightning fast JavaScript in your browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">with V8. </span></p>
