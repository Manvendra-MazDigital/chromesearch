<p><span class="line" data-startTime="0"> SALMI: My name is Deborah Salmi and I work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">in marketing for Web of Trust. Web of Trust </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">or WOT for short was founded in 2006 by two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">university post-graduate students from Finland. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="18">Both worked as researchers in the field of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="18">computer security and data mining. During </span><span class="line" data-startTime="24">their research, they came up with the idea </span><span class="line" data-startTime="24">of creating a reputation system for the web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="30">The goal was to make the internet a safer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">place for everyone, make it more democratic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">and to give everyone a chance to contribute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">to this objective. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="39"> What is your extension about? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39"> SALMI: The average web user wants to know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">which websites they can trust. The WOT add-on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">is a safe surfing tool for your browser. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">shows you traffic-light-style rating symbols </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">that tell you which websites you can trust </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">for safe surfing, shopping, and searching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">on the web. Many experienced users &mdash; they want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">to contribute to web safety. WOT rating is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">powered by a global community of millions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">of trustworthy users who've rated millions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">of websites based on their experiences. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="74"> How did your vision evolve as you were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">working on your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77"> SALMI: We had a clear vision of our extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">from the beginning. This was our third browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">platform. The first version of our extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">used a toolstrip and a mole for its user interface. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="91">But we've had a UI similar to Chrome's browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">actions for years now on other browser platforms. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="96">And we're very happy to see the Chrome team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">ultimately decided to go with browser actions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">instead. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="102"> How difficult was it to integrate with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">your existing service? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105"> SALMI: Well, integration with our existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">service, it was easy. We have a web service </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">API, and we use HTML HTTP request to access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">it from all our other extensions too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="114"> What did you enjoy most about writing your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119"> SALMI: We like the fact that it's easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">to reload and test extensions without restarting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">the browser. Chrome's developer tools were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">a great help in debugging the extension as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="132"> What were some challenges you faced when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">writing your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136"> SALMI: We would have liked to see some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">additional APIs for cryptographic primitives, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">hash functions especially, URL parsing, IDN </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">conversions for example. So we ended up implementing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">these in Java Script instead. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="152"> Was there a particular technical challenge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">you faced in which you gave an innovative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">solution? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160"> SALMI: Chrome was initially lacking a full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">internationalization framework, so we decided </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">to implement our own because we wanted to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">support multiple languages right from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">beginning. So later, the internationalization </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">framework Chrome team implemented, it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">almost identical to ours. Supporting the extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">to use it was trivial. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="181"> What do you think about Google Chrome's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">decision to use CSS, HTML and JavaScript as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">the basis of its extension framework? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184"> SALMI: It was brilliant &mdash; brilliant decision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="191">Chrome's move to use HTML, JavaScript and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">CSS to create extensions was a brilliant decision, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">and it makes developing extensions possible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">for anyone with web development experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="204">It's a lot easier to develop extensions for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">Chrome than for other platforms. Also the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">fact that extensions are just web pages, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">gives Chrome a natural way to sandbox them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">from each other and from the privileged browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">process. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="219"> How many times have you updated your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219"> SALMI: We've had 12 updates since the initial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">release. And updating the extension through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">the website, it's really quick and it's convenient. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="232">And we especially like the fact that there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">no need to wait for a human review before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">the extension is published to users. So combined </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">with Chrome's automatic extension updates, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">this makes distributing bug fixes and new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">features to our users very convenient. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">you know, we've noticed that Chrome users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">are far more likely to use the latest version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">of our extension than users who have other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">browsers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="256"> How did you promote your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256"> SALMI: Our user community was all a buzz </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">about Chrome, so when the dev channel and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">then later the beta channel was released, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">we blogged, we tweeted about it, and many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">WOT fans tried it out. And because we made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">sure we were one of the first extensions to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">be completed for Chrome, many of the respected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">tech sites included WOT in the "must-have" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">list for Chrome. So now, we are working on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">updating our website and featuring WOT for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">Chrome more prominently. Part of that is educating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">users that they have a choice when it comes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">to browsers. But whichever browser they choose, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">we want WOT to be part of their safe-surfing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="305"> What advice can you give someone before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">starting to work on a Google Chrome extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310"> SALMI: Developers who are starting work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">on a Chrome extension, they should carefully </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">think about the architecture of their extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">and decide early on what they want in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">background page and what should be done in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">content scripts. If they plan to localize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">the extension, it's a good thing to prepare </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">for that from the very beginning. </span></p>
