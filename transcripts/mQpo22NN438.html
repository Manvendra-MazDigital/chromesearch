<p><span class="line" data-startTime="0"> KAY: So, I'd like to take a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">of time now to see if we can look at a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="5">of these cool extensions that have been made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="5">already. And I'm really happy to be able introduce </span><span class="line" data-startTime="11">somebody that we've been working with closely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="11">in the community from pretty early on. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">Colin from Xmarks, come on up and let’s </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">see your extension. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="23"> BLECKNER: Thanks, guys. I'm Colin. I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">here with Will. We’re Software Developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">for Xmarks. One of our main products is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">Cross Browser Extension that synchronizes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">your Bookmarks between different computers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">and browsers. And we're happy to be here today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">talking about one of our recent projects, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">Xmarks for Chrome. We'll start with this quick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">demo of Xmarks in action. You can access our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">main UI from the Xmarks icon on the top-right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="48">As you can see, we're currently synchronizing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">successfully. And from this page we can also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">access some of our other local settings. Xmarks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">icon also gives us a shortcut to my.xmarks.com. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="58">This Website gives you online access to your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">Bookmarks from any computer as well as some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">of our more advanced online features. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">since we're already synchronizing, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">see the bookmarks in those browser that match </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">up of what you see here in the Bookmark bar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">for Chrome. So, to show Xmarks in action, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">Will is actually going to delete one of his </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">Bookmarks on our website. That means the next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">time we sync in Chrome, that deletion will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">come down and we’ll move it in Chrome, too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="76">So, if you go to the Xmarks icon and hit “synchronize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">now,” look at that synchronize go, and when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">it finishes, that Bookmark should also get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">removed from Chrome. That's taking a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">second. There you go. The Bookmark is gone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">there, too. Similarly, if we were to add a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">Bookmark in Chrome, or move things around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">and then synchronize after that, that change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">will go back to our servers and from there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">out to any other computers and browsers running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">Xmarks. As a software developer, there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">a couple of things that I'm excited about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">in Chrome. The first is that everything is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">written in HTML and JavaScript. This makes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">it really easy for us to put over our existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">extensions. Xmarks for example has a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">client side code. And we're able to pour it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">pretty much all of our core sink code to Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">without any changes at all. And we didn’t </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">just happened to get lucky in this one case. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="116">A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">tabs. This is another Xmarks extension that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">helps users discover similar sites while they’re </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">searching. I got it up and running in Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">in less than a day and there's something like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">50 Chrome specific lines of code. Everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">else was shared Cross Browser Code. This is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">a huge win for us and not just because we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">get things up and running so fast, more importantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">for me, it means that maintaining that code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">in those extensions is going to be a lot more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">manageable for us in the future. The second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">thing I'm excited about is that the extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">API has access to HTML5 features. When I first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">started working on Xmarks for Chrome, one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">of the biggest issues I had was figuring out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">how to store information on a user’s computer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="151">We store a lot of data locally to help speed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">up our sink process, but the extension API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">doesn't, you know, have any file I/O code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">or support. However, HTML5 has things like &mdash; it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">got local storage in SQL data bases. And so, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">I was able to take our file I/O code and rewrite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">that using this HTML5 features, and everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">else runs smoothly on top of that. Overall, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">I'm pretty excited to be writing extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">for Chrome. I think that the extension API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">itself really promotes Cross Browser development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="175">and that's going to make it a lot easier for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">us to build and maintain our extensions. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">thanks again, guys. And up next we could got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">Jeff talking about Google Translate. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="184"> JEFF: Hi. I'm Jeff from the Google Translate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">Team. Before I begin, I wanted to just give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">a quick shout out to Jerry Tieng (ph). The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">Engineer who developed the translate extension. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="198">Unfortunately, he couldn't be here. So, I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">be giving the demo instead. So, let's say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">you're searching for the top French news stories, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">and start by going to google.fr. Since the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">content of this page is in French but my browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">language is an English, the translate extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">will pop up and prompt me to see if I &mdash; whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">or not I want to translate this page into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">English. Since I don't speak French, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">I'll go ahead and click on translate. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">voila, the page is now instantly translated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">into English so I can read and understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">it. So now I'm looking for news, so now, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">know, I'm able to find news since it’s in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">my language. I'll go ahead and click on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">news link. And since this next page is also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">in French, the translate extension will immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">translate the page as well. So, if the translate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">extension looks similar or the same as the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">Website translator gadget that's on Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">Translate, well, the reason why is because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">it's the same code. Developing the translate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">extension was quick and easy because we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">able to leverage the existing code that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">created. In order to reuse this code though </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">we had to propose or re-propose to extensions &mdash; two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">functions to the extensions API. The first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">one, detects language, automatically detects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">the language of the page and returns it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">us. We use this to determine whether or not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">we should prompt and show the standard to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">the user to translate the page. The second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">function executes script allows us to inject </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">our existing gadget code into the page and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">tell the browser to execute it. So in summary, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">developing the translate extension for Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">was extremely easy and quick because we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">able to reuse and leverage existing code. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="312">And if there's a function that you need that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">doesn't yet exist, you can propose it to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">Chrome team and once approved, you can work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">with them to get it implemented. And next, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">I'll &mdash; Adam from eBay will share with you his </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="330"> ADAM: Thanks. It's great to be here. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">know, it's been a long time since we started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">eBay as just a Website. Ever since we first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">launched our public APIs in 2000, we really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">viewed eBay as an E-commerce platform, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">our customers can buy and sell wherever they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">are, really creating a new and much more robust </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">site than what we had before. And we sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">of called this policy “eBay anywhere.” </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">We want our customers whether they're using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">a mobile device, whether on eBay.com, whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">they're using a desktop gadget to experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">eBay wherever they are. And that's why development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">environment, such as, Google Chrome are so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">important to us because we know that many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">of our customers do use Chrome. And we want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">them to have fantastic experience when they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">do so. Now, I'm going to give a quick demo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">of an extension that one of our team has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">working on. Just like the Translate Team, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">Diane Forch [PH], she couldn't be here today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">because they are in London. But I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">to do a demo on their behalf. So, again, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">doesn't matter. You could be on a page, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">know, searching news at google.fr. And you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">say, “Hey, I want to check to see what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">going on eBay.” And so, we have a menu right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">here and you can go and click and find out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">what's going on. I'm already signed in, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">you can see I’m sort of watching a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">items: Lego Star Wars, new sneakers. I’m </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">going to say, “Oh, maybe I want to get that.” </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">You know, but wanting more information, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">know, you can sort of click and see more and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">sort of just little fade, it moves over, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">you can see all the information you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">know about the item, or and, actually, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">you want to, you can go and place more, go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">and actually place the bid. Alternately, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">is sort of what we call “my eBay interface.” </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">And so, those are active items. We also have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">ended items, right? These are all the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">that I've been watching or buying or lost. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="433">And if I say, “Hey, I want to try to find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">that. Hey, what was that item that I just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">won? ”Well, then I can just sort of click </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">here, pull up a little menu and do a filter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">in place just to find the item that I won, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">and there it appears, right? So now, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">changed so I should leave a bid to lead feedback. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="446">So, everything is sort of in context, in place, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">really easy to filter it. Of course, we also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">have the ubiquitous search box, so I could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">look for kittens, for example, but, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">we actually have policy. You can’t sell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">kittens on eBay, so. So, I won't do that because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">Lord knows what might show up. Sorry, do it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">yourself. Anyway, so, once again, we really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">enjoyed, it’s really a fun experience writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">the extension. The integrated development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">environment, which you sort of saw earlier, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">made it much easier for us to build and debug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">it. Also, we have existing extensions for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">other browsers and similar to what you also, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">again, heard before, it was very easy for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">us to port over our code. All the business </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">logic, this one straight over, and then we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">had to go and tackle the UI that we just have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">to do that for Chrome, and that made, again, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">keeping all of our code basis in synch nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">and easy. In fact, that's one of the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">that we really took advantage of when we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">doing the design with the HTML5 and CSS3 to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">do what we really wanted, because Chrome has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">a different approach as you learned. More </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">minimal approach to user interface and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">had to figure out how do we tackle that problem, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">you know, while we're miming Webby and also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">eBay. And so, those were really great. I sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">of thinking about how to handle it and also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">we want with a sort of a mobile approach, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">because they both have in some ways that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">restrained, real stay, and smaller UI that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">needs to get done. And so, when we tackle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">that, we said, “Hey, we can take advantage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">of CSS3 to do rounded corners and gradients </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">for the background.” Things that we had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">done before, but we had to put image hacks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">and things we didn’t like. So this was much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">cleaner and really simplified our presentation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">logic. Likewise, with HTML5, we will to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">much more or beyond the fact that we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">cookies, right? So with eBay, there are a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">lot of user preferences, there's a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">data for each of the items that you can be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">watching up to 200. In this case, we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">able to use the Name Value Pair Database for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">all of our preferences. We've able to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">the SQLite database to store all the items </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">and made it very for us to really keep all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">the information right here and improve the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">speed and efficiency, which is, again, something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">that we really want to make sure our customers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">experience. So overall, we really had a fantastic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">time with working with the Chrome Team and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">we really want to thank them for all the support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">that they've given us. The best part from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">my standpoint is when we built this extension, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">everything we saw here those are our public </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">APIs. We don't have to make any changes to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">our own APIs to implement this. So, any developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">whether it’s eBay or anyone in this room </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">or anyone in the Internet, can go and build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">that right now. And so, we really hope that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">developers will see this as a great opportunity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">for them to use Chrome as a platform to extend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">and great fantastic extensions for our community. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="619">So, if anybody wants to talk to me, I'll be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">out of here later. And so, now I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">hand it over to Nick from Google. </span></p>
