<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="19"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Hi, guys. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="21">You don't know the amount of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">trouble that we've had trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">to get this ready. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="24">I'm here with one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="24">my friends and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">colleagues, Ian Barber. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="28">So I hope this is working. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="29">If not, then we're just doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">this for no reason as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="32">However, let's get started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">properly, shall we? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">My name is Paul Kinlan. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="36">I'm a developer advocate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">at Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="37">And I can't say advocate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">at all properly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="40">I'm an advocate, apparently. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="42">And I work on the Chrome Team, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">and we're here to talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">Chrome apps. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="45">So just before Christmas, we did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">a whole series, about 12 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">different episodes about what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">happening inside of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">Chrome and Chrome applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">and all that type of stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="55">And we had a little break </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">over Christmas. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="57">We came back today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="59">This is our very first one, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">we came back today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="61">And we've decided to show you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">what's happened since </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">Christmas, I think is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">best thing to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="66">When I say since Christmas, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">think to put in context, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">best thing to say is that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">had two hackathons. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="72">We've actually had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="72">more than that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="73">We've had three hackathons </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">overall. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="74">We had one in London, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">was, I think, October, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">November time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="78">And then we were going to plan </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">one in Boston and one in New </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">York, and one in Mountain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">View as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="84">But for scheduling conflicts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">and some other reasons, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">Boston and New York hackathons </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">got put back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="89">But we've done them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="90">We have a whole load of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">great guys come along. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="92">Some of the people on the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">Apps Community Group on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">Google+, they came </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">along as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="100">And we showed some really cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">stuff, and we did some really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">nice things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="104">I think today is going to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">just really us showing you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">what the community, what people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">inside the Chrome Apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">Community have built. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="111">So I think we should start. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="113">Should we start? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">I think we're good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="114">Yes, we got a nod from my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">co-producer at the back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="119">So let's go from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">the beginning. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="124">Boston was our first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">one, I think is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">easiest thing to say. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="127">It was based in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">Bocoup Loft. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="129">They let us host there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">and I think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">30 developers came. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="134">It was quite cool, and we got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">quite a lot of good apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="137">I got the first one, actually. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="138">So I basically prepared this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">whole list of applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">that we're OK to talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">a little bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">publicly, at least. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="146">And the first one, I can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">really show you because I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">haven't got my credit card </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">ready to go and buy it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="150">But it was called Mad Dash. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="151">Basically, it's not a horse </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">racing simulator, but you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">basically place fake </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">bets and see which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">horse is going to win. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="160">The interesting thing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">actually &mdash; and I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">shift off this one a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">bit sooner than I planned, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">because this actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">wasn't a V2 app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="167">So we have these two different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">models at the moment. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="169">We have packaged apps and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">packaged apps V2. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="172">We haven't got an official name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">for the apps V2 just yet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="177">And the main difference is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">the original packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">apps live entirely inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">the browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="182">So they live inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">the window Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="185">You probably can't see on my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">desktop at the moment because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">I don't think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">being shared. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="187">Now it's being shared. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="188">Awesome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="190">So Mad Dash, this is the one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">here, and I was showing you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">the screenshots before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="194">This is Mad Dash. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="195">It's actually a V1 app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="197">And the thing about V1 apps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">it's like TweetDeck. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="199">TweetDeck is a V1 app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">where it lives </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">entirely inside the browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="202">So it'll live here, basically. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="206">And there's actually quite a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">of things that we learned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">from Chrome OS, is that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">want applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="210">They want their web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">applications, but they want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">them to live outside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">the browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="214">And this application is a V1 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">app, so it lives inside the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">browser still. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="218">But actually when they demoed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">it, it was actually still a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">pretty good app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="220">It was still pretty cool, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">but it was a V1 app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="225">So I should close that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">one, and I will show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">you a V2 app, Trail-app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="230">So this is one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">the contestants </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">from the Boston hackathon. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="235">And basically, if we launch the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">app &mdash; we can launch from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">the Chrome Web Store &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">you should see the fact that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">it's actually outside the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">browser at the moment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="242">Now, it's a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">wobbly because I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">moving it around loads. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="246">But the idea is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">you can get full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">control of the canvas. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="249">You can control the entire UI </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">that's presented to your user. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="253">And in this case, they've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">chosen just to go with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">normal title attribute, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">a title bar, so it's like a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">basic window without any extra </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">little bits on it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="260">You could launch different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">types of applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="261">You can have applications which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">don't even have this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">little white bar across the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">top where you control and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">minimize, maximize, and close, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">and the ability to drag the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">window around yourself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="271">So you could have a Drag button </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">right in the middle of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">the application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="275">But essentially, this was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">thoughtbot trail maps app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="279">It was kind of cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="282">From what I understand, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="282">basically ported a traditional </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">web application into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">offline kind of model. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="286">And that was actually one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">things that we found from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">quite a lot of applications, a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">lot of developers at least, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">that they quite often had a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">web application that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">already had on the web, but they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">wanted to move it into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">this native wrapper. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="299">And the thing about this native </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">wrapper is actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">it's offline first. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="302">It's offline throughout the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">entirety of the application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="305">And you basically try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">and integrate online </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">functionality in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="308">And the reason why we do this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">is because we want our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">applications to work when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">the user is offline. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="313">You've got a Chromebook, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">you've got your Mac or your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">Windows machine, and you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">your application to work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">wherever you are, regardless </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">of connectivity. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="320">Or at least maybe not work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">completely, because obviously, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">if it's a Twitter app and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">have no internet connection, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">you can't go and get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">your tweets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="327">But you should be able to at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">least see all the tweets that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">have come back in the past. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="331">You should be able to reply to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">a tweet and, say, queue it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">be sent later on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="336">And if you're on the web, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">press Refresh or try and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">launch a bookmark when it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">not on the web or not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">connected, you're up a stream </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">without a paddle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="350">I have to be really careful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">how I say that one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="353">But you're in not a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">situation, and that's one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">the big things that a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">people found when they tried </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">to port their applications to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">this platform, at least, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">that you have to think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">differently. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="363">You have to think in much more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">of a native app kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">developer mindset, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">online functionality is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">integrated into your app and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">not offline functionality. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="371">This is a nice app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="371">It's basically a tutorial. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="375">It's kind of a code quiz, from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">what I remember, that lets you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">basically learn about different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">technology, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">understanding the fundamentals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">of JavaScript. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="383">And then by the end of it, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">should be able to understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">that you can iterate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">over collections. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="387">For a day's worth of work and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">getting it from a complete </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">online website into an offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">packaged app is really good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="394">So that's the Trail-app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="395">We have the next one, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">the VideoPlayer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="397">I'm pretty sure I'm allowed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">to show this one. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="398">They said yes next to it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="401">But we have the ability to play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">videos, and there we are. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="405">It's playing a video. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="407">It's kind of cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="408">I think we can go more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">full screen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="410">This is the full full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">screen API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="413">And I'm hoping that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">allowed to show this video. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="417">I'll get into trouble. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="418">But the idea behind it is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">you could have a full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">canvassed canvas </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">video element. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="422">So this area here is just a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">custom HTML5 video player. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="427">It's nothing extra </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">and special. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="429">That's all it is, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">I mean, you might sit there and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">go, well, what's the use? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">Well, some of the really cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">things that you can start to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">do with this is that you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">access to TCP and UDP sockets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="439">You could create a local </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">network for local media </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">servers and then pull the list </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">in off there via the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">[INAUDIBLE], essentially. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="447">So you can go to your Xbox Media </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">Center and pull in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">videos and play it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="450">And then once you can play it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">on your desktop, or whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">it's your Chromebook, well, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">happens if you wanted to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">go on an airplane? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">Well, the really cool thing was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">you could basically say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">well, I want to take this video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">that I've got on my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">Media Center, and then bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">it onto my Chromebook or my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">MacBook or whatever machine that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">you have, and then play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">it when you're offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="466">So I think that's quite a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">powerful demo, and to get this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">integrated in one day </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">was pretty cool. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="472">The things that we would like to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">see off these type of demos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">is, for me at least anyways, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">removal of this title bar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">across the top. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="479">I want it to be full canvas, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">full screen video from edge to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">edge regardless. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="484">And then when you go for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">Full Screen button, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">actually to use the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">Full Screen API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="488">That should work and you should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">be able to take that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">window and make it a proper full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">screen like you'd expect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">from a native application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="495">So that's pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="497">We have Happy Friday. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="498">Now this was in Boston, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="498">believe, and this was actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">a really good app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="502">So basically, Happy Friday is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">a game that they have been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">working on already. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="506">So it's not a brand new game </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">from the day, but they got it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">to work offline. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="510">And it basically is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">an SVG-based &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">I believe it was SVG &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">SVG-powered game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="516">So we launch it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="517">Again, you can see this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">nice window that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">not part of the browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="522">And we have this little dude. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="524">And I got confused with this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="525">It's not press Right to start, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">it's actually press D. So we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">can go through, start level. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="530">Let me see if there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">any sound. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="532">No audio at the moment. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="533">Oh, there is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="533">[ELECTRONIC SOUNDS] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="537"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Pretty cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">[SHEEP BAAS] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">[LAUGHTER] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="541"><span class="speakerName">Paul Kinlan</span>: Did not realize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">that was on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="543">Sorry, hoping the sound's on, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="543">but there was a sheep in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">background. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="546">But you can at least jump. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="548">You can do these cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">things, collect. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="550">And you know, this is the thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">that we want to try and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">get from this platform &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">wow, oh, he died &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="556">is the ability to have games </span><span class="line" data-startTime="556">that work offline, games that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">you install, games that users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">think are games on their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">platform, not just these games </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">that live inside a full web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">page, inside a Flash kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">of container in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">middle of the screen. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="570">We want these games to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">be immersive, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">And to get this in one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">day was pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="574">I'm really pleased </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">with this app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="576">I think this should sell it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="577">I think it's a game that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">could sell quite easily. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="579">Whee! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">It might use Box2D to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">do all the physics, but it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">powered, I believe, by SVG. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="591">And I think these guys won, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">well, won the best app or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">best looking app in Boston. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="597">It was a really good effort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">from the guys. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="599">So let's have a look at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">next one, LetterBrush. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="602">This was Boston as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="604">So this one I had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">no idea existed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="607">I didn't even know that this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">was a thing, but basically, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">when you're creating a 2D game, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">you want these maps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="613">You want the ability to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="613">basically construct a map so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">you can do certain things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="621">So I press on the keyboard F </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">and C. And I can build a 2D </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">map quite quickly. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="627">I can say, this is a line. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="629">I'm going to go from here, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="629">I can build across that way, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="631">and I'm going to square. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="633">This is my 2D map, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">That's what you want. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="637">It's pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="638">Now this actually is an existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">web application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="644">It's not a brand new app for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">day, but what they've done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="646">again is they've taken this web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="646">application and ported it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">into a native container. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="649">And it works completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">offline. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="650">I mean, you don't have to think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="650">about App Cache and use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">all these are other things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="654">But the really cool thing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="654">I like about this was that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">they actually let you save using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">the Export button and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">then Save to File, and you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">save directly to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="665">user's desktop. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="666">So that's my web server, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">so that's OK. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="670">So Save, done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="673">Now I believe what basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">happened in the background is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">it basically did Auto Save </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">all the way through. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="679">And then the thing that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">don't get on the web right now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">is the ability to do an Auto </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">Save, so you can't save a file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="685">and then keep a reference to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="685">that file and then keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">writing and writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">and writing to it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">whereas you can in this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="690">And that was pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="691">I believe this might have won </span><span class="line" data-startTime="691">one of our best apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="694">A lot of people really liked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">this application in Boston, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">just because they took it from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">a completely online app and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">brought it offline. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="702">Pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="705">Now this one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="706">Let me refresh this page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">because it's installed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="710">This is called Chompy Ball. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="712">I've only played it briefly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">inside New York, but I watched </span><span class="line" data-startTime="718">one of the developers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="718">and I can't remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">his name at the moment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="720">Let's see if he's got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="720">it on there &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">Raheel Khalid. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="725">And basically, this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">a really good app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="727">Basically it's a 2D canvas. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="729">The entirety of this surface </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">is a 2D canvas. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="732">Let me just play it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="733">I like playing games, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">I'm not going to pay </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">attention to you guys. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="737">Here we go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="738">And so he built this game in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">day at the New York hackathon. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="741">And the entire thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">is just a canvas. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="744">And it's a relatively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">simple game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="746">But the really cool thing was he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">actually built it with just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">a Chromebook entirely. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="750">So he didn't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">a normal PC &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">or what we'd say a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">normal PC, as a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">Chromebook is a normal PC &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">a traditional desktop or a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">traditional laptop, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">He built this thing with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">just Chrome OS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="760">And the really cool thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">was he used a &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">let me just go to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">gethub.com/chromeappsamples &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">Mini Code Edit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="771">I believe he used this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">tool here, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">called Mini Code Edit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="780">Essentially, Mini Code Edit is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="780">just a normal code editor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">using the Ace Syntax highlighter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">done by the guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">who do Cloud9, I believe, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">Cloud9 IDE. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="791">So he basically just used the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">Ace Editor inside this Mini </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">Code Edit, could save files out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">to his desktop, open them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">back up again, and made this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">entire game in one day just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">using the Chromebook, which I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">think is quite impressive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="804">There was a another guy from &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">actually, his tab is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">here, Joe Sullivan. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="809">He built this thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="810">I can't demo it today, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">I can't just get it working. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="812">And I need some apps to show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">it working properly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="815">But Joe Sullivan actually did a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="815">whole lot of stuff around a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">clone of the Web Intents API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="822">Because obviously, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">we've removed Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">Intents from Chrome. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="825">We have people who still want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">to use basically an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="829">application discovery mechanism </span><span class="line" data-startTime="829">so that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">communicate between apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">without having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">to know each other. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="834">And he built this thing called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="834">Spoke, which is an API, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">basically, to emulate Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">Intents inside Chrome Apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="841">And he built that in a day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="842">He actually did that using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">the Chromebook as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="845">So that was really cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="846">I think we had two guys in New </span><span class="line" data-startTime="846">York use Chromebooks, and one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">guy in Boston who's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">used a Chromebook. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="852">But the game was particularly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">impressive, Chompy Ball. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="854">It was pretty cool just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="854">for that one day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="858">And finally, I can't remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">the guy's name now, but he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">actually did two apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="864">And he's only listed one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">of them at the moment. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="865">But Paycheck Calculator </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">was pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="868">And again, this was, he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">says, pretty much a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">ripoff of this one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="874">It's kind of cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="875">But the thing about this, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="875">a simple app for working out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">basically tips and keeping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">track, in a more textual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="883">format, of expenses. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="885">And we had to do some things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="886">The interesting thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">about this was &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="887">we'll launch it first &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">dinner for 12 at $12, maybe, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">then I bought an Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">Nexus 4 for $250. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="934">You got it working in a day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="935">Interestingly, we had a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">problems with this because as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">you've seen, if we type text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">in, see the thing? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">A lot of it kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">expands and moves </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">about the actual surface. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="944">Well, this didn't work at all. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="946">So this is like a content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">editable area. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="949">And the very first time that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">start this application, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">starts out with this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="958">We had two problems, actually. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="959">First, we couldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">select any text. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="961">We couldn't actually start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">typing in, because it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">content editable div &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="967">it's a pre or a div. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="968">But it's not a text area. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="970">It's just something that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">content editable. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="972">And content editable itself </span><span class="line" data-startTime="972">doesn't accept user clicks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="976">So the thing about apps is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">you can't select stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="981">all the time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="983">This is the thing you see about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">the web at the moment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="984">You're in Gmail, and you double </span><span class="line" data-startTime="984">click on something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">that's not quite the actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="987">email document, it might be a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="990">part of a button, and then all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="990">of a sudden, the entire user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="992">interface is selected. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="994">So what we've done with apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">is we've inverted the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">selection model so only text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">boxes and text input areas and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1000">places like that, where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1000">expect to actually input text, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">are things that will actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">start to receive text input. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1006">It sounds a little bit silly, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1006">but that's what's happened. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">So content editable items aren't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">in the actual style </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1014">sheet to have the ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1014">to actually do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1016">user selectable text. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1018">But that wasn't too bad. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1019">We fixed that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1019">It's just a CSS attribute, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1019">WebKit Text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">Select, I think it is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1023">And then you can start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">to type stuff in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1025">And I think the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1025">interesting thing about this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1027">was we have &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">I think it's a bug, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">it might not be. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1030">We have this issue where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1030">might set your window to 500 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1035">pixels by 500 pixels, however, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1035">the HTML element is 0 by 0, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">until you start filling it with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">content, so that actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">wraps the content rather </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">than fills the window. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">So you have to basically put a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">CSS attribute on your HTML </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1049">element and your body element if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1049">you want it to also fill to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">be width 100%, height 100%. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1057">And sometimes you can also put </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">Position Absolute, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">kind of fixes it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1061">One big bit of feedback that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">we did get, and let me just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">see if I can test this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1066">See that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">This is kind of interesting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1068">there's no scroll bars. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1070">Now, we need feedback from you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1070">guys as developers to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1072">say whether we should have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1072">overflow auto straight on this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1075">thing, or whether you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1075">want to control </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">that yourself manually. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1079">I think it's a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1079">of a user nightmare. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1081">I can't scroll back up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1082">You can get around if you just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1082">put overflow call on Scroll X, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1086">or Overflow X Scroll, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1086">instance, or Overflow Y </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1089">Scroll, and then you can get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1089">the scroll bars back on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1091">But we need to know from you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">guys whether you should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1093">actually have this as a default </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">feature inside the platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1096">So anyway, that was the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">Paycheck Calculator. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1099">Let me see if he actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">put his other app in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1104">No, he didn't put his </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1104">other app in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1105">I can't see it there at least. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1107">So it was a color picker, so it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">let you basically just have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">a color picker. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1110">You expect color pickers to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">part of the web, not as a web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">page, as a separate app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">and that's what it was. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">And that was it, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">So we had quite a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">developers come in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1120">I think there was 50 or 60 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">overall in both hackathons. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1125">Obviously, some people didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">want us to talk about and show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1128">off their applications, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1128">so we haven't done it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1131">But if we get some permission, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">we'll ask the guys to come in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">as well and show some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">really cool stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1136">The new things that have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1136">happened since Christmas is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">kind of interesting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1140">We've got a couple of things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1140">that we're going to talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">over the next couple of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">weeks on the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1145">Apps side of things. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1146">So we have rich notifications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1148">So some of you guys might have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1148">seen a Rich Notification Panel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">happening Chrome OS, and some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">things on Google+ by a guy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">called Francis who's found </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">some of the stuff that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">happened inside Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1159">So we're going to show off the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1159">Notification API, essentially. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1163">The Notification API is kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1163">interesting because we had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1166">an HTML5 Notifications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1168">It wasn't HTML5 Notifications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1170">It was a specification that's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">SubSpec of the broader HTML5 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1173">specification, which is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1173">notification specification, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">and it had two components. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1178">We had one component, which was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">Create Notification, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">then we had a second proprietary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">one, which was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">called HTML Notification, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">you could basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">create an iframe that would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">appear as some part in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1191">A lot of user agent vendors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">didn't like it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1193">We liked it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1194">TweetDeck used it like crazy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1196">We liked it, but a lot of other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1196">user agents didn't like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1198">it because it didn't integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1198">with the native system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1203">notification providers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1205">So you're Android kind of thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">that you bring down at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1207">the top, that's not HTML. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1208">That's just basically strings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">of some images, and likewise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1210">with iOS as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1212">So we've still got HTML </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1212">Notification in Chrome Apps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">but we're going to encourage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">people to use the Rich </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1219">Notifications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1221">So I think Joe Marini, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1221">believe, is going to show you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">that demo at some point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">in the near future. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1227">We also have push messaging, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1227">which I can talk about, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1231">because it's on the Docks, make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1231">sure it's not secret. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1234">But we have this idea of push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1234">messaging, basically, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">you should be able to basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">send a notification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">to a server, and then any one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">your connected applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1244">should be able to receive that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1244">notification and display </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1246">something to the user. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1248">So we're going to have that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1249">That's kind of interesting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1249">We're also going to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">about alarms as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1252">Some people tried to use alarms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1252">at the hackathons to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1254">varying degrees of success. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1256">And the idea of an alarm is it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1256">kind of like Set Timeout </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">on Set Immediate where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">provide a function, tell it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1265">when in the future it's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1265">to be called, and then the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">system will notify your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">application when it should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1270">wake up and process that code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1272">The interesting thing about this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">is that it's not exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1275">like set Timeout. </span></p>
