<p><span class="line" data-startTime="39">So without further ado, let me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">just share with you a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">slides that I prepared. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="45">And basically, what we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">to cover in the next 10, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">15 minutes will be some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">main things that I see more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">and more when I'm working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">here with startups. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="57">And for those of you that are in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">the Tel Aviv area, I highly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">recommend you to check out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">campus Tel Aviv, that we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">basically devoting and helping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">startup to bootstrap and to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">leverage the knowledge that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">have here in Google in order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">to bootstrap their initiatives </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">and to make sure that they are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">leveraging and using the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">right technologies at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">the starting point. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="83">So who am I? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">My name is Ido Greene, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">and I'm Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">Advocate with Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="89">You could reach me out after the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">show or any time that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">have any comment or feedback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">on one of the products. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="95">We basically acting as Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">Advocates and not as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">evangelist, because we like to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">devote at least 50% of our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">time to listen to developers &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">it could be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">developers in startups. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="106">It could be developers in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">big organizations &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">and to bring those comments </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">and feedback back into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">engineering groups. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="114">I'm mostly focusing on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">Chrome HTML5, Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">OS, and Cloud platforms. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="120">And if you have any other things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">that you would like to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">touch on, please feel free to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">ping me, and I'll try to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">redirect you to the right people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">that taking care of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">so many other platforms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">and APIs that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">have here in Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="134">I'm mostly active these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">days on G+. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="136">And you could reach me out at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">plus.google.com, and then just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">+greenido as one word. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="143">And greenido as one world will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">work also on Twitter, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">could, of course, check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">out my blog. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="149">By the way, all the slides of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">this show will be in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">footnotes of the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">Developer Live event, and of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">course on my blog. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="158">So first and foremost, when we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">are starting a company &mdash; and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">I'm hearing it a lot when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">I'm talking with young </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">entrepreneurs &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">basically, make sure that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">don't thinking about the exit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">strategy from the beginning. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="172">If the only thing that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">guiding you is how can I sell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">this thing as soon as possible, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">you're probably not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">going to build it to last, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">Jim Collins said, but you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">going to build it to flop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">with a high probability. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="189">So planning for legacy or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">planning to build something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">that will last for many years, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">much more healthy approach. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="196">And I like this quote from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">Mark Cuban, because it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">emphasizes exactly what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">I said, but in his </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">own words, of course. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="205">A few things to keep in mind, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">and that's basically, I guess, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">the first step that each and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">every entrepreneur needs to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">before they're starting to run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">on their venture, is to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">research and thorough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">research. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="219">Today we have sites like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">AngelList and many other, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">like second market and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">just Google it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="227">But try to find if someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">is already answering this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">specific pain point that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">you recognize. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="234">And keep in mind that companies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">that are active and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">basically are doing business in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">the market, let's say for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">quite nice time in the past, are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">quite efficient, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">the ones that aren't efficient </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">aren't there anymore. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="248">So it's not a healthy point of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">view to say something like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">the company that I'm executing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">against is just too slow, too </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">dumb, too inefficient. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="261">Keep in mind that if the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">company's active &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">it might be that some cases, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">there are inefficiency in big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">organization, and of course you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">want to tap and leverage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">them, but keep in mind that in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">a macro view, most companies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">are quite efficient. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="277">Technology is becoming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">commodities more to emphasize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">that if you are building yet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">another app, or you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">launching a feature that is part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">of a bigger [INAUDIBLE], </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">like let's say for example, a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">startup that will hold all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">your photos in the Cloud. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="294">It's just yet another feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="294">that Facebook, G+, and many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">others could and actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">now already doing it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="302">But let's say that they didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">provide this specific service. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="305">It's just yet another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">feature, and this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">the last point here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="309">You want to try to avoid it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">because if you already worked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">on it for two years and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">this big gorilla, or giant, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">you will, is executing against, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">you're basically in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">the path of the elephants, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">and you don't want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">to be in this path. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="323">Aim for the real need. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="325">I see more and more NGOs and VCs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">and actually entrepreneurs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">as well, they're trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">emphasize this point of let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">build companies that are built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">on real computer science and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">not just another hack </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">here and there. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="339">And I think it's very important, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">because in the end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">of the day, you do want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">make sure that you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">building something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">will be meaningful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="350">Let me try here just to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">sure that you see my screen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="355">And let's, again, try to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">it, because I think I saw that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">you lost it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="361">Hopefully, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">seeing my slide. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="365">Coffee drinkers get it right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="367">Actually, I just rephrased what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">DHH from 37signals said. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="372">He spoke about drug dealers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">but I like to speak about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">coffee drinkers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="377">And as an addicted coffee </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">drinker myself, I know exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">what does it mean. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="384">And here, we're coming to say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">something like build an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="386">amazing, great product that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="386">people will be addicted to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="390">And yeah, you could give free </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">samples, and you could give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">short espresso cups. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="397">But in the end of the day, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">do want to make sure that your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">experience, your service is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">amazing, and people get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">addicted to it, and they are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">keep using it on a daily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">basis, hopefully even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">more than that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="411">Keep in mind that usually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">efficient organizations are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">actually delivering and building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">themselves in a way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">that they will act as efficient </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">as possible. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="423">And in this case, it's just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="423">coming to show what we learned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">in "Freakonomics," that drug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">dealers organization are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">exactly mimicking what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">McDonald's is based on in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">terms of the hierarchy and how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">managers are delegating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">responsibilities. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="437">And it's true in the startup </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">early days you don't need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">pay too much attention to it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">because each and every member </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">is wearing lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">different hats. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="445">But you do want to put </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">organization and structure and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">objectives and [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">results and make sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">everyone is running through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">the same goals. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="455">If you are not sure about why </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">users are dropping you or are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">not [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">you want, just go to the drawing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">boards or try to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">improve and iterate quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">on your product. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="470">And we'll touch about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">it a bit later. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="473">Hiring the right people, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">it's one of the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">problematical challenging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">aspects. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="479">You want to make sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">at least the core team is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">composed of people that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">really admire, people that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">could do lots of things and do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">it with a very high quality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="493">Do everything that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">yourself in the early days. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="496">It not only will give you more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">runway, because you'll be more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">efficient and you'll leverage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">the cash or any other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">resources that you have better, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">but because it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">force you to hire and start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">spending your capitalization </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">only when you must. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="515">Don't pass on great people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="517">That's another hard lesson </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">that I learned myself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="520">Usually, those people are very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">busy, very active, and when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">you are lucky enough to meet one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="524">of them, and you see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">they and your venture are on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">same page, definitely go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">and do whatever you can in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">order to put them on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">the boat with you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="537">We know today that CVs and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">actually any resume that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="543">candidates will give you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="543">composed for many years of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">irrelevance. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="547">And one of the best things here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">is not only to make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">that you are giving some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">problems and see how the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">candidate is thinking, but just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">try to start small, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">in some cases, if the candidate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">is already working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">as a freelancer, it might be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">better just to try before you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">hire him for full time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="567">And that could actually make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">expectation and be for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="572">benefit of both sides. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="574">Empower your team. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="575">I think that it's crucial that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="575">the cofounders and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">management team will know that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">they are there just to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">delegate and make sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">they are giving their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">developers, designers, product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">leads, all the [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">and capabilities in order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">to build what they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">think is the best. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="593">And Jim Collins, that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">mentioned before, wrote some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">several amazing books that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">highly recommend you to read, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">like "Built to Last" and "Good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">to Great." And he's describing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">a level five leader as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">the top level of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="606">leader it could be. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="607">And you could think of someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">like Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">of Amazon as people that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">want to mimic, but behave, of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">course, nicely. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="618">Good is fine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="619">One of the things that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">seeing more and more in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">startups is the trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">polish too much things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="625">And of course, it's always gray, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">because you do want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">have this amazing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">magic experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="631">But on the other side of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="631">equation, you do want to focus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">on your most valuable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">product, service. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="639">And sometimes you just want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">get it out, get the feedback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="642">from your users, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="642">then iterate and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">improve it over time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="645">So the main point here is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">to wait two years down the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">road and then put something in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">the air and get real knowledge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">from your users on what it does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">to them, but be agile and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">try to take small decisions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">that are much better to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">encapsulate, and then just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">keep iterate on them very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="665">frequently. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="666">I think Google is a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">example for doing exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">that, even in a large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">organization, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">not only in a startup. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="672">In a startup, in my last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="672">startup, we actually called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="677">ourself more of a &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">looked at ourself more as a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">small car, not a small boat, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">but basically you're enjoying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">the ability to pivot quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">and to move quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="689">And that's something that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">really want to grasp and take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">it to your own hands an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">advantage, because big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="697">organizations are moving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="697">much more slowly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="699">It's true that when they are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">taking the decision and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">are moving, they are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">elephants on the path, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">don't want to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">on their path. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="706">But at least you could pivot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">quickly and avoid them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="709">So the main point here is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">keep in mind that your money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">that you raised and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">resources that you got are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">very limited, and you probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">need more than you expect, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">try to be as efficient as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">possible and execute as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">quickly as possible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="727">When we're coming to speak about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="727">a business and not a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">startup, I think it's just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">connecting us to the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">point, which is try to avoid </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">this la-la-land or this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">ever-lasting land that some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">people are living in. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="742">And don't neglect the ability to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">monetize or to leverage the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">ability to have this other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">side of the equation of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">revenue or some kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">of revenue stream. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="755">And I mentioned, of course, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">people that are building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="758">just to exit are basically, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="758">with a high probability, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">building to flop. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="765">Beliefs and reality, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">see some of the young </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">entrepreneurs that are coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">here to the campus, and we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">mentoring them, coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">with sentences like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="775">the first two here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="777">And in most of the cases, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">very, very far from reality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="782">So the only way that you confirm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">yourself that you know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">what your users really want is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">after you launch a product, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="788">and you have the metrics, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="788">and you measure them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="791">And as you all know, you can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">manage what you can't measure, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">and you do want to measure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">everything and anything in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">order to understand deeply </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">what is making your user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">happy, and then iterate over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">it and try to make it even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="803">more magical. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="806">Predicting the future or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">far future, of course, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="809">could see all over that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="809">fail tremendously in trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="814">predict the near future, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="814">actually the far [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="819">greater [INAUDIBLE]. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="823">The progress and measuring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">progress, there's lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="827">thoughts about [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="832">trying to move us and shifting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="832">us into [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="837">that you can predict better, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="837">set [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="841">in order to accomplish them. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="843">And then helping us be the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">speedboat that we spoke about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="849">on the last slide and respond </span><span class="line" data-startTime="849">quickly and act quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="856">Focusing, I think, is one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">the most important aspects. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="859">Because you have limited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="859">resources, limited time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">limited money, you want to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">sure that you're focusing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">on all the people in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">your organization. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="867">And it could be the three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="867">co-founders are just focusing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">on the same needle that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">we want to move. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="874">Passion, of course, if people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">are not passionate, especially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">in the core team, if you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">see the light in their eyes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">and they don't put those 140% or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">200% of effort and time and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="887">devotion into the startup, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="887">probably it won't be a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="890">successful one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="892">And execution, execution I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="892">think is one of the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">important aspects to consider. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="897">Great ideas are all over, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">what's really differentiates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">is the execution and how well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">you execute according to your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">objective [? and pure ?] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">results. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="910">Plan, of course it's a must. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="913">And you do want to plan, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">you do want to set goals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">quarterly, yearly, and probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">something above, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">everyone will be clear about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">what is the North Star of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">venture, your company, and where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">you want to see yourself </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">on the long run. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="928">But keep attention that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">everything is changing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="933">everything is volatile, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="933">do want to be as agile as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">possible, because this is one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">of the strength capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">that you have at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">the beginning. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="941">Find good advisors. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="943">Easy to say, really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">hard to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="945">But when you do find them, pay </span><span class="line" data-startTime="945">attention that you listen and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">you are able to gain and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">leverage their feedback. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="953">What to do fast? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">So we spoke about those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">main components. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="956">And I highly recommend you, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">you are in the front end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">development arena, and you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">producing interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">products, services to the web, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">the diagram here are coming to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">emphasize that we need and are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">actually changing today the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="974">ways that we work in the past. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="976">So basically, this diagram is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">just showing us that it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="979">never ending story. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="980">We keep iterating after we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="980">working and launching the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">first version of something. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="985">And this is the way to make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="985">that we are executing as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">fast as we can. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="992">What to avoid. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="993">So yeah, if you're not an expert </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">on bikes, probably you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">do want to avoid </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">this situation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="999">And in our case, when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">coming to pitch to angel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1002">investors, each and every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1002">sentence here is well &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">how should I put it &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">is very known and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">well-preserved from their side. </span></p>
