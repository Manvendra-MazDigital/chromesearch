<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/SDaf7f9yl6E">youtu.be/SDaf7f9yl6E</a><div id="transcript"><p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: All right. Hi, everybody. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3">Good morning. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="6">Good morning! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="6">Good morning. Wow, it's amazing to see so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">many people out in the morning, and hello </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">to you back there who waved to me. Thank you. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">So I'm Ellie Powers. I'm the product manager </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">for Google Play developer, so many of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">guys here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="19"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: Hi. I'm Miles Barr. I'm the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">engineering manager for apps in Google Play. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="21"><span class="speakerName">Riccardo Govoni</span>: Hello, I'm Riccardo, tech </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">lead for the Google Play Developer Console. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="25"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: All right. And some of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">saw us earlier this week at I/O, and so what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">we're going to be doing today is to give you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">even more of what we showed you. So you will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">get to see more details on the features that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">we announced as well as a couple more new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="41">So let's go back in the past for a second. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="41">Last year, Android Market &mdash; do you remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">that? It was a recent memory. And Google Play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">was brand-new. And all of you who publish </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">apps on Google Play were using something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">looked like this. This is the old Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">Console. I hope you've completely forgotten </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">about it but if you haven't it looked a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">bit like a Web form from 1999. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="64">So Miles and I came on the stage at I/O last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">year and said, guys, we've totally heard you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="70">Your businesses are really taking off and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">you need something that's really going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">scale; right? You need some professional tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">to support all the great things that you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">doing now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="81">And we said, "Don't worry. We've got your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">back. We've been working on something great." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">It's the new Developer Console. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="87">So back in London where we're all based, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">were excited to see your response. You started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">sending us thousands of pieces of feedback. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="97">It just all started pouring in. And many of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">you may be wondering, I sent in that feedback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">and then what happened? Did anyone read it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">Did it just go into a hole? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">So I can tell you, rest assured, your feedback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">was read, and I know that because I actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">read every single piece of feedback that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">sent in via the feedback ling at the top of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">the new Developer Console. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="115">So I can tell you that, actually, we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">delighted to see that the number one piece </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">of feedback that came in was, hey, guys, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">new Developer Console, it's a lot better than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">the old one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="126">And so we were relieved that at least we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">going in the right direction. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="129">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="129"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: All right. Thank you! Thank </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">you so much. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="133">We were absolutely delighted to see that positive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">response. But also what started coming in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">was a bunch of feature requests. "Hey, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">is great, but." "Could you also do." "How </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">about this?" "I also need that." "You really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">should be doing more." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">And we said absolutely. We totally agree with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">that. And so that's why we've been rolling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">out a ton of new features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="154">So what we're going to do today for you here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">with some great demos is to show you how Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">Play is evolving rapidly. We're rapidly moving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">to bring you tons of new features that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">going to grow with your business and help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">you support Google Play's enormous audience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">around the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="170">So let's walk through what we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">do today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="172">So again, we're going to be going into more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">detail on what you've already seen and also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">seeing new stuff. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="177">We're going to be going through three different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">areas. We have publishing your app your way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">on Google Play, how you can take control of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">publishing in our store, connecting directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">with customers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="187">Secondly, we're going to be talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">optimizing your app, how we're giving you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">more data so you can deeper into how people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">are using your app and improve it. And then, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">finally, how you can expand your app globally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">to take advantage of Google Play's global </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">footprint and reach more audiences in new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">markets, expanding your business. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="204">So without further ado, we're going to look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">at cool new stuff, and Miles Barr is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">to take us through that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="211"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: Thanks, Ellie. I want to start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">today by talking about how Google Play keeps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">you in control of publishing your app. Our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">philosophy has always been to put no barriers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">between you and your users. When you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">a new version of your app ready, you can push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">it out to everyone at the same time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="224">This can be very daunting, though, as anyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">who has pushed a new app with a serious bug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">knows, so we figured we can do better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="234">So I was happy to announce on Wednesday that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">we launched the beta testing and staged rollout </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">feature in Google Play. This means you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">start testing a new version of your app with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">a small group of alpha testers, and when it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">ready, move on to a larger group of beta testers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">and once you're comfortable that your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">is ready for prime time, you can roll out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">in stages to the rest of your user base. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="251">This means you can keep your startup's new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">apps under wraps. You can try out a major </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">new UI with just your power users, or you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">can even give a preview to the press. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="261">And why is this important? Because we want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">to ensure that your users are always happy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">with your app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="273">So let's take a look at how this works. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="273">Here we are in the Developer Console. As you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">can see, there are two new tabs, alpha testing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">and beta testing. These are essentially the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">same thing. They're two targeted groups that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">allows you to send a version of your app to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">specific set of users. If your user is in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">both tests, they will receive the alpha one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="296">At Google, our philosophy is to test our software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">early and often, so whenever a build is ready, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">we send it to our team so they can try it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">out. So let's switch to the alpha. So we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">do the same here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="305">So first we've got our new APK, and what we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">going to do is we're going to target our team, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">and we're going to do this with a mailing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">list. So Riccardo is entering our team mailing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">list here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="318">Now, when you target a user for a beta test </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">or an alpha test, they are not automatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">opted in. For them to receive the version, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">they need to go to this link here and opt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">into the test. And this is available on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">Web and on the phone, and it explains to your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">users what being a tester is and they can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">opt in. And if at any point they want to opt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">out of the test, they can come back to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">same page, opt out and uninstall the test </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">version of your app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="341">Now, beta test and alpha test are private. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="348">What this means is until a user opts in to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">your test, they'll see no details about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">app on the Play Store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="352">Similarly, we don't allow reviews of prerelease </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">versions, so none of the details of your new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">app will leak. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="362">We recommend using mailing list or Google+ </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">community to talk to your testers. We do collect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">statistics and crash report data on your test </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">versions so you can track the progress of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">how it's going. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="371">So let's say the alpha test has gone great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">so we're going to move it to beta. And this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">time we want to have a wider set of testers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">so instead of a mailing list I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">use a Google+ community. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="385">This community some of our most engaged users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="385">They love our app. They love testing early </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">versions and giving us feedback on the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="394">So Riccardo is going to just let the group </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">know that we've got a new beta test ready </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">and they can opt in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="398">Now, when setting up a beta test, it's important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">to get a good representation of your users, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">and by this I mean make sure you have a good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">mix of devices, people who speak different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">languages and people on different carriers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="413">You want to ensure your app works for everyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">once you publish it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="417">Okay. So we've got a lot of feedback for our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">beta test, we fix some bugs, and this latest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">version we're comfortable with, so we want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">to get it out to production. I'm feeling pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">good about it because it's been through so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">many rounds of testing, but sometimes a bug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">does slip through, and what happens when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">launch it? That means you get a lot of unhappy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">users and one-star reviews. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="435">So we're going to be on the safe side here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">and we're going to do a stage rollout. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">rather than choosing everyone, we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">to start with about 10% of our users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="443">At this point users can now review your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">so you can see the feedback of how it's doing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="449">And if there's a problem, you can stop the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">rollout, create a fix, and then we'll push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">that fixed version to that same original 10% </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">of users. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="458"><span class="speakerName">Riccardo Govoni</span>: Shall we go to everybody? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="463"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: Hmm? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="463"><span class="speakerName">Riccardo Govoni</span>: Shall we go to everybody? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="465"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: Yep, let's go to everyone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="465">All right. And you can also use this feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">to control traffic to your back-ends. We know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">sometimes when you release a new version of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">your app, the traffic patterns differ. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">by just looking at 10%, making sure your back-end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">servers can handle the load, you can be sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">once you push it to everyone, your app will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">work great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="490">Okay. Let's hear about how someone has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">using beta testing. Wattpad is a great app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">that gives you access to over 10 million free </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">books and short stories. They have been beta </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">testing since the beginning and they do this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">by having two different apps in the Play Store, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">the beta version and live one. The beta version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">they push every week and the live one about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">once a month. Each feature they add to their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">app goes through three to four rounds of beta </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">testing, so they get lots of feedback and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">they decide if it makes the cut and should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">go to the multi-release. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="520">A great example of this is the new UI you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">see up here. They recently changed how users' </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">books appear in their library. This is quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">a big change. They wanted to see how users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">react to it. Unsurprisingly, they found that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">some users got it, some didn't. There was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">a bit of confusion. So before they launched </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">it, they added a tutorial section explaining </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">what the change was and of how to find your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">books. This led to a seamless rollout to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">rest of their users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="545">Previously, while they have been beta testing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">before we launched our feature, this meant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">that they had to create two listings and also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="556">manage their testers outside of Google Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="556">With the launch of today's feature, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">retain store listing and also use Google tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">like Google groups and Google+ communities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">to manage your testers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="566">All right. Wattpad has a huge beta testing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">community of 25,000 users but they've told </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">us that they've seen benefits back when they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">only had ten users. This gave them access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">to a wider range of devices than their testing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">in-house and it also meant they got early </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">testing from real users. So if you only get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">one star again, you know you haven't been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">beta testing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="597">All right. Now I want to talk to you about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">tablets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="601">There are over 900 million Android devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="601">activated now, and a growing part of that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">is tablets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="607">On androiddeveloper.com, we now show you the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">proportion of devices by screen size and screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">density. Tablets have large and extra large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">screens, so you can get a good idea of how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">many tablets are out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="623">Also on developer.android.com we've launched </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">the tablet app called a checklist. This explains </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">Google's criteria of what makes a good tablet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">app and gives you advice on how to optimize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">your app for tablets. If you haven't seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">this already, please go to developer.android.com </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">and check it out. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="637">Also, in the Developer Console, here in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">optimization tip section, we automatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">scan an app against the checklist to see how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">you're doing. If there's anything which your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">app doesn't meet, we explain it and tell you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">how to fix it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="652">So it's important to follow these tips so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">you create a great tablet experience for your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="659">Also, once you created a great new tablet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">UI, nice multi-pane using the fragments API, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="665">you want to show it off. So last month in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="665">the Play Store we gave you the ability to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">upload tablet screen shots so you can show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">how your app will look on a seven-inch and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">ten-inch tablet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="674">When a user goes to the Play Store on a tablet, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">they'll see the tablet screen shots first, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">and on the phone, they'll see the phone ones. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="684">On Wednesday we announced that the top lists </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">on tablets will be able to be filtered down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">so users will only see those apps designed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">specifically for tablets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="692">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="692"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: Thanks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="696">So make sure you follow all these guidelines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">so your app doesn't get left behind. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="701">So let's take a look at a great tablet app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="701">I'm sure you've heard of Evernote. If you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">haven't, it's an app that lets you collect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">notes, record Web pages, everything, and keeps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">you &mdash; syncs across all your devices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="709">Evernote has been creating a tablet app ever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">since we launched Honeycomb back in 2011. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="714">They created a beautiful multi-pane UI and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">spent a lot of hard work on their tablet experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="724">It's all this hard work that's kept them a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">consistent editor's choice in Google Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="729">And it's not just a hit with us. It's also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">a hit with their users. As you can see here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">the second most popular device is a Nexus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">7, a tablet. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="738">Evernote has thought long and hard about what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">makes a good tablet experience. If I'm on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">the phone, their users want to take &mdash; call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">it a Quick Note, will maybe pull up a piece </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">of information, but on a tablet they spend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">a lot more time organizing and planning and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">getting real work done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="753">Here is what the V.P. of product had to say. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="753">By focusing on creating a great tablet experience, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">they created more engaged users, and these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">users have gone on to become paid subscribers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">of Evernote. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="766">All right. Now I want to talk about a feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">that's coming later this summer. A lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">you have sort of told us you want to give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">access to the console to a lot of more people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">in your company. In fact if you were in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="780">Fireside Chat yesterday, a lot of you asked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="780">for finer grain controls to the Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">Console. So late this summer we'll be releasing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">several new permissions in the Play Store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">allowing you to control exactly what each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">of your users can do. And these permissions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">can also be set on a per-application basis. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="795">So if you ever wanted to give someone in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">company access to your stats but make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">they don't mess around with your APKs, you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">soon be able to do that so please stay tuned. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="805">Last year here at I/O, we announced the pilot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">to our reply to reviews feature. This allowed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">you as a developer to reply directly to your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="818">users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="818">I'm happy to say after lots of rounds of testing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">and tweaking we've now made this available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">to every single developer on Google Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="827">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="827"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: It gives you a direct channel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">to your users, so if you haven't started using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">this already please read up on our policies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="837">and guidelines and start replying now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="837">Now I'm going to tell you how one developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">has been using this feature. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="842">TextPlus is an app that lets you chat with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">your friends all around the world through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">free SMS's and cheaper calls. TextPlus has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">gone all in on replying to reviews. Everyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">on their team takes part in this, from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">engineers, the product managers, and of course </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">their customer support team. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="860">Every day, twice a day they look to see if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">they have any new reviews and reply directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">to them. By doing this they've really connected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">to their users and found out where their biggest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">pain points are. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="868">For each negative review they try to turn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">around that user's experience by giving them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">advice and pointers to more help. If they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">succeed those users typically change their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">review to a positive one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="881">But they don't stop just there. For their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="881">positive reviews, the five-star reviews, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">find these reviews are their most engaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">users, their biggest advocates to tell other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">people about the app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="889">They use the reply-to-review feature to speak </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">directly to them to get their opinions on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">new features and what else they want to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">in this app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="899">By focusing on the user and having this attentive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">customer support, the newer versions of TextPlus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">have a higher average higher rating in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">store than the previous versions did. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="909">Here's what they had to say about it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="915">They have used this direct line to the users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">to prioritize a what features they can focus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">on and now they have happier users and higher </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">scores within the store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="926">Now I'm going to hand over to Riccardo, our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="926">tech lead, to tell you more about data. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="929"><span class="speakerName">Riccardo Govoni</span>: Thanks, Miles. Hello, everybody. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="929">So Miles showed you how you have more control </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">on the way you deploy your app to your users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">and how you present it to them. Now I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">to shift your attention to data. I want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">show you how Developer Console helps you make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">informed decisions about your app and your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">business and helps you figure out what is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">the next most important thing to focus on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="948">Over the course of the last year, we expanded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">the amount of data that we make available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">in Developer Console. I think you're familiar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">with the standard metrics, installs and uninstalls, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">per user, per device, divided across six different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">dimensions, country, SDK version, application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">version, language and more. But in the past </span><span class="line" data-startTime="967">few months we rolled out a few more metrics, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="967">and we announced a couple, even a couple of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="971">these were given in the keynote, so let me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="971">focus on them for a second. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="975">One I want to talk about now is rating stats. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="975">Rating stats show you how the users' star </span><span class="line" data-startTime="981">rating for your application changed over time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="981">This is the metric you want to look at when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="986">you want to see whether the new version of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="986">your application that you just rolled out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">is getting the same good user reviews, good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">user satisfaction compared to the previous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">version. We offer this in two variants. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">you have the cumulative rating. This is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">overall aggregated rating over the lifetime </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">of your application. This is good for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">long-term view, when you want to review what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">you did historically in the past and the decision </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">that you made at the time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1007">Another one that we offer is the daily average </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">rating. This is the aggregated over all daily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">ratings over the lifetime of your app and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">this is good for the short-term view, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">you want to spot problems early on. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">I want to mention a couple of cases where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">this is particularly useful. One is reply </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">to reviews. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1026">So you can use this metric to identify segments </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1030">of your user base where customer satisfaction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1030">is not as good as you would expect. And from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1035">that, you can then jump to reply to reviews, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1035">as Miles just described, and provide dedicated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1040">customer support exactly to those users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1040">On the other side it works the other way around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1045">as well. If you're spending a lot of time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1045">doing customer support and offering replies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1050">to your users, then you might want to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1050">this metric to verify the effectiveness of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1054">what you've done and see that you are actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1054">achieving the results that you are expecting. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">Another feature in which this is particularly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">useful is stage rollouts. Unlike offline beta </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1064">where a user cannot leave reviews or ratings, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1064">during stage rollout users will able to rate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1070">and review your app. And that means when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1070">are at 5% of a stage rollout, if you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1073">a brand-new application out there, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1073">on the edge of your chair, you want to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">sure everything is fine, you might want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">use this metric to see whether everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1081">is doing as well as you expect. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1081">In this example we rolled out a new version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1086">of our application in mid-April, the orange </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1086">line, but it never really caught up with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1090">baseline, which is the green line. So this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1090">is maybe the point where you want to pause </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1093">your stage rollout and decide what to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1093">Like all the other metrics that we have, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">the breakdown by the top ten values, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">the top ten countries, or et cetera, is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">enough, obviously you can always export as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">a SVC and you get the full data payload so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">you can integrate it with your tools. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">Another thing we want to talk about is filtering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">crash reports because we now allow you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">filter crash reports by application version, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">since a few weeks. Again, now that we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">Beta testing, this is extremely useful because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">it means you can look at the crash reports </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">that are coming only from your alpha version, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">maybe it was a little more crashy, and decide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">what to do. During a stage rollout, we keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">collecting crash reports so you can see and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">decide what to do for your stage rollout, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">whether to pause it or continue it based on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">the amount of crashes you are getting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1143">So now everything is fine. Users are happy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1143">You're not getting any crashes. Unicorns and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1148">rainbows all over the place. It's time to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1148">talk about money. I want to talk about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1153">new page that we launched on Wednesday which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1153">is revenue charts. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1157">I always found it a bit annoying that just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">to figure out how much money you made yesterday </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">you had to go to Developer Console, download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">the SVC report, put in a graphic in a spreadsheet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1166">program, aggregate everything just to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1166">how much money you made yesterday and I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1169">that was just nonsense and so we decided to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1169">fix it and starting Wednesday you have this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">new page. How all the revenue for your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">changed over time. Aggregated daily, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">divide it or inspect it by country and by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1181">source of revenue, say by applications, revenue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">generated from application sales, in in-app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">products or subscriptions. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1190">I think this is great to get an overview of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1190">how your application is doing at a glance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1193">You can come here every day, look at how much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1193">money you made yesterday. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1197">And it lets you also do some sort of analysis. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1197">You can, you know, look at whether you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1201">ahead of your company targets or not, whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1201">some countries are performing as well as you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">would expect. But I also know that many of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">you want to integrate this data with your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1209">own custom financial reporting tools and data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1209">pipelines. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1214">So another thing that we're doing in the coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1214">few weeks is that all the financial reporting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1218">from the Google Play Developer Console will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1218">be available in Google Cloud Storage. What </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1222">that means is that by using the utilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1222">provided by Google Cloud Storage, like GSU2, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">you will be able to have programmatic access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">to your financial reporting, to your financial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1231">data so you can integrate it with your own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1231">data pipelines. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">The other benefit of this is that thanks to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">the new permission model, granular permissions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">that Miles just described, you will be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">to set up a dedicated account that will only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1246">have access to financial data, and only be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1246">used for accessing financial data in cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1250">storage. And that account will not be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1250">to mash up with your APK configuration or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">something. So you can separate roles there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1253">Okay. Let's talk about referral tracking and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1261">usage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1261">So another thing I would like all of you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1264">have is one place, one single place, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1264">you can see all the data that pertains and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">is about your application. And I know that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">many of you are using Google Analytics to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">track user engagement and user interaction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">with your application. But so far, the experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1278">was fragmented. You had to go to the developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1278">console to see device and install metrics. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1282">You had to go to Google Analytics to see activity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1282">and user engagement. And soon, so in the coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">few weeks, you will be able to link together </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">Google Analytics and Google Play Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1292">Console. And what that means is that once </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1292">linked together in the Google Play Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1297">Console &mdash; sorry, in Google Analytics, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1297">will have access to additional new metrics. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1301">In particular, you will be able to see how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1301">many views, downloads, and installs your marketing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">campaigns triggered on Google Play. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1306">And this is really good, because it gives </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">you a better view of the conversion funnel. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">You can see much more details about how your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1315">users discover your app and then want to install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1315">your app and then became daily active users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1320">This integration goes both ways. So you will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1320">have access to engagement metrics directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1329">from the play developer console. So next to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1329">installs and other metrics, you will also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1333">see engagement, like, number of active users. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1333">Okay. So a few more things about optimization </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1342">tips. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1342">So Miles spent a few minutes talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1347">how you can use the optimization tips section </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1347">to learn whether your app is well designed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1352">for tablets, whether it meets the quality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1352">checklist requirements, and et cetera. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1356">But I have bigger plans for the optimization </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">tips section. I want that to become the place </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">where you go to discover personalized recommendations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">and insights that are specific to your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1365">and your context. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1365">So starting from a few days ago, from Wednesday, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">you now have additional tips present in that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">section, what we call them localization tips. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1373">They help you how to reach a broader audience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">and how to expand your app to multiple countries. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1380">When you decide it's time to go global, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">know, you have to do a number of things. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1384">have to localize your APK, you have to then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1384">localize your store listings. You may even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1388">want to consider localizing your screen shots, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1388">because for some markets, that's really important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1393">And most importantly, you have to decide which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1393">countries to focus on first, where should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1397">I go first. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1397">So now in the optimization tips sections, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1401">you will get these localization insights that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1401">will guide you in the process. They will tell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1405">you whether you're missing anything. Maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1405">you localized your APK, but you forgot to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1409">localize your listing. And we'll also help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1409">you identify opportunities. They, for example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">will tell you, you may have a lot of users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1413">from Russia. Even though you never localized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1417">your app there, that's a great opportunity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1417">that you should go into. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1423">Which brings me to the next topic, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">reaching Play global audience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1430">When you decide to go &mdash; oops, too bad. When </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1430">you decide to go global, the first and most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">important thing that you want to do is localize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">your application contents. And many developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1441">are already doing that and expanding into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1441">new markets. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">And as a non-native English speaker, as some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">of you may have guessed from my funny accent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1448">&mdash; I'm Italian &mdash; I think one of the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1448">important things is to make sure that your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">app is available to as many users in as many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">countries and as many languages as possible, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1458">but still providing the same high-quality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1458">experience that you would provide to users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">who speak your own language. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1462">And we announced on Wednesday that now from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">the Google Play Developer Console, you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">access to professional translations in collaboration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1472">with the Google Translation Manager team. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1472">Let me show you how this works. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1479">So in the APK screen, at the very bottom, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1479">there will be the recently used section, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1484">is called the app translation that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1484">use to start to request a professional translation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1488">Just click the button, starts a wizard that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1488">will guide you through the process. You pick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1493">a project name. That is just for your convenience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1493">Some of you may have multiple projects going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">on at any same time. Pick the version &mdash; sorry, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">the language you're translating from. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1505">then upload the strings. If you're using the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1505">Android developer tools, you can use that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1509">directly from the Eclipse plug-in. Otherwise, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1509">you can just upload the XML files. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1516">Once that's done, you wait. Then you go, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1516">pick the languages you want to translate into. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1523">I'm going to pick, I don't know, Japanese </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1523">and Korean. Those are just two markets that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1527">you cannot be outside of. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1527">You pick the service level. The service level </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1531">basically decides how many users, how many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1531">people are actually looking at your strings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1536">and contributing to the translation in a translation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1536">company you pick. You get an idea of the price. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1543">You choose the translation company you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1543">to use. You get an indication of how long </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1546">it's going to take and how much it's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1546">to cost. Obviously, the cost of the translation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1550">depends on how many words you have in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1550">strings file. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">And then you get a confirmation page where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">you can reorder and get started with your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1560">translation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1560">The moment you confirm that, the translation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">company will start right away translating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1564">your strings. And from the developer console, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">you will be able to check progress. You will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">be able to see how far (indiscernible) the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1572">translation is in translating all your content. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1572">While they're doing their work, you will be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">able to communicate with them, answer any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">questions that might arise, troubleshooting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1580">these kind of things. And then once all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1580">strings are done, you will be able to &mdash; again, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1586">from the developer console &mdash; download them, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1586">put them into your APK, pack everything, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1592">publish. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1592">And this feature is rolling out in private </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1595">beta, just like we did for the developer console </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1595">itself last year, which means that if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1598">go to the APK page right now, you will see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1598">a sign-up form where you can see &mdash; where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">you can leave your contact details. And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">we will shortly start rolling this out to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">everybody. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1610">I want to reinforce again the importance of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1613">reaching a global audience. I want to speak </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1613">for a few seconds about Gameloft. I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1617">all of you know who Gameloft is. They are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1617">a successful games company. They are based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">in Europe. They realized very early the importance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">of targeting multiple languages and multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">locales. They're currently available to 12 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">languages: English, German, Italian, French, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">Chinese, Japanese, and a few other European </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">and Asian languages. And they have (indiscernible) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1638">experiences they want to share with you. One </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1638">is when they wanted to localize Ice Age Village </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">to Russian. So Ice Age Village has a user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">base of 10 million users. And they discovered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1648">that 14% of those users are actually Russian </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1648">users. That's the second biggest market after </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">English users. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">Another case that they had is when they decided </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">to localize My Little Pony to Turkish. As </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">part of a global application update, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">had the Turkish localization. And they discovered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">very interesting figures. So the number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">active users in Turkey jumped up by 95% compared </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">to 20 to 25% that did in other countries. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1675">And that was thanks to the presence of localized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">content rather than just a simple application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">update. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1679">The revenue jumped up by 600% in Turkey. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">the revenue per daily active users jumped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">up by 300%. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1689">Another tip that you might want to use that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1689">I took advantage of, they used local holidays </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">and other local knowledge to make promotions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">and sales, like they did, for example, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1697">the Chinese New Year. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1697">So let me stress it one more time: Think global. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1704">Always aim to target a really global audience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1704">in multiple countries and multiple languages. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1708">I hope that this feature that we just announced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">will help you do that easily. And if you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1712">to learn more, there's a session at noon, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1712">I think, which is Building Android Apps for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1716">a Global Audience, where you can learn more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1716">on how this translation process works and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">the details behind that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1720">Having said that, let me go back to Ellie. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1726"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: All right. Thanks, Riccardo. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1726">Today, we've given you an overview of everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">we're bringing you to try to help you grow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">your businesses across these three areas, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">first, publishing your app, having more control </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">over it, connecting directly with your user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">base. Secondly, gaining insight into your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">users and what they're doing with your app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1745">And then expanding your app to grow your user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1745">base into new markets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1749">So because there was a lot of stuff, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1749">going to give you a quick summary of everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1753">that's new. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1753">So, first of all, we have, of course, beta </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">testing and staged rollouts, which allows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">you to get user feedback early in the process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1760">and respond to it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1760">Secondly, we're giving you summaries and overviews </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1765">of user ratings and your revenues so that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1765">you can check those stats at your fingertips </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">very easily. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1770">Next, we're giving you tablet-specific screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1774">shots so you can show off your awesome tablet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1774">layouts. And if your app isn't designed for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">tablets yet, we give you optimization tips </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">to help you make it that way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1783">We're also helping you identify how to localize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1783">your app and where you should go first with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">new localization tips. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">We also announced that everyone can now reply </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1791">to reviews. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1791">But stay tuned, because there's a lot more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">coming this summer. So we have three new areas </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">where you should watch for some announcements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">on the Android Developers Blog in the future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1800">First of all, we're going to be having those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">extra access controls so you can grant more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">people access to the developer console without </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">getting worried. We're also adding new Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">Analytics integration figures. So these were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">the campaign referral tracking flows, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">conversion funnel, and also seeing your Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">Analytics usage data directly in the developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">console. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1823">And, finally, if you're interested in translating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">your app with our new App Translation Service, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">which is being offered in partnership with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">our internationalization team, sign up today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1832">in the developer console. It's at the bottom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1832">of the APK page if you're looking for it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">Okay. So as I said at the beginning, everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1837">that we're doing is with you, Google Play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">developers, in mind. And we need to keep getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">your feedback in order to plan our next 12 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1847">months and even farther in the future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1847">We hope you'll join us for office hours today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1851">following this session. We hope that you also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1851">rush right back after that, because at 12:00, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1856">there's a very important session on monetization. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1856">And everyone is looking for more information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">about money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1860">So if you're watching this session online </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1863">and you missed the office hours, you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1863">to make sure that you're following Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">developers on Google+, because that's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">best place to go to see new announcements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1871">about what's happening in the world of Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1871">development. You can watch Hangouts. We always </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1876">post our blog post there as well. And we go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1876">and look for your feedback about what you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1880">looking to see on Google Play. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1880">So that's it. And the next thing we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1885">to do now is start by taking some questions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1885">We have about eight minutes left. So if you'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1890">like to come to the microphone at the front, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1890">or I think there may be possibly one there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">as well, that will be great. We'll alternate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">between the two microphones. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1898">You in the red hat at the front, what would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1898">you like to ask? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1900"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi, Chuck Grove from AWeber Communications. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1900">I actually have two really quick questions. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">I had a lot more, but I narrowed it down to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">two. So with the new alpha/beta production </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1911">system for launching a new version, is there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1911">still a concept of draft APKs? And if so, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1916">how does that relate to testing in-app billing? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1916"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: Great question. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1921"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: Can I take this one? Yes? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1921">When you go to the advanced mode part of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">tab, you can upload draft APKs. So that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">sort of still separate from alpha and beta </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">testing. You can imagine the alpha and beta </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">tabs is exactly the same as production. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">the drafts are shared across all three sections. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">Correct? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1939"><span class="speakerName">Riccardo Govoni</span>: Yep. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1939"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: So they will have access to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">in-app billing for testing purposes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1944"><span class="speakerName">Riccardo Govoni</span>: So specific for in-app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1946">billing, I think we still have a few improvements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1946">to do. But from the in-app billing sandbox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">that was announced in these days, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">both use the tester section and the developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">profile to decide testers that will have access, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">for example, before in-app billing experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">without a link to actually pay. Or you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">use beta testing and then side loading that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1966">APK, for example, to do fake purchases. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1966"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. Thank you. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1975">And then my other question was about the staged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1975">rollouts for the actual listing. If you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1979">to add some new screen shots, new description, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1979">things like that, if you're doing a staged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1984">rollout, is only the people who are getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1984">the update going to see the new listing or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">is everyone going to see it? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1987"><span class="speakerName">Riccardo Govoni</span>: No. At the moment, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1989">just still one listing. So you may want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1989">be &mdash; you want to pay attention to that for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1994">the moment, for the time being. So if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1994">put something in your store listing, for example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">a brand-new feature, and you're still rolled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">out only to 5% of the users, you know, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">may be &mdash; you have to communicate it publicly. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">Maybe you say to say that we are rolling a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">new version, and that's the feature that they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">getting and they will be getting over the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2010">next few days. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2010"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So you say "for the time being." That </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2012">makes me hopeful about what's to company. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2012"><span class="speakerName">Riccardo Govoni</span>: Yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2014"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: Always looking for feedback. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2014">In the back, please. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2017"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi. My name is Manford (saying name). </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2017">I have an interest in automating the whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2021">process of the deployment, how we're staging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2021">and deployment. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2024">Is there some sort of, like, plan towards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2024">being allowed to, like, integrate on a continuous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2030">integration server to automatically, as part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2030">of, say, a nightly build with QA tests that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">are automated, push it out to a staged environment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">automatically? I mean, at the moment, I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">doing with Selenium, but that's a hack; right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">So is there some sort of plan to, like, have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2045">an API maybe so it could even be integrated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2045">in build tools? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2047"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: Would you like &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2047">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2049"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: Yeah! All right. We totally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2049">heard you. This has been a super popular developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">request; right? Everyone's got their own system, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">and we're really excited with the beta testing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2060">that more and more people want to be pushing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2060">their APKs even more often. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2063">So I guess, you know, we won't say too much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2063">about the future. But we definitely will say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2067">that we've heard that, we're thinking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2067">it, and, you know, as soon as we have anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2071">to share, we'll definitely let you know. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2071">we definitely hear you on that one. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">a very common request that we get. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2074"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2079"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So in the Play Store, you guys added the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2079">design for tablets feature because you recognize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2083">that phones and tablets are fundamentally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2083">different in their apps. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2086">With more smart Glass products coming out, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2086">is that going to be extensible to other types </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2091">of products? And if one were to manufacture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2091">such a product, how would they engage with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2094">you guys to make sure that that feature would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2094">happen and set the criterias and all that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2099">kind of stuff? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2099"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: All right. Take this one? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2102"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: It's a good one. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">So right now we're only sort of focusing on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">tablets. But we're aware, you know, within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">our own team &mdash; well, our team and externally, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">lots of different form factors that are coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">out. So, you know, when you think of things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">like Google TV, it's something we consider. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">I think we want to wait for a particular device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2122">class to sort of take off or begin to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2122">a foothold before we change the store. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2128">definitely other form factors is something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2128">we would consider. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2131"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2131"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: All right. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2134"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I have a question about the device distribution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2134">of my app in the Play Store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2140">So when I see, like, the top ten devices where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">my app is doing good. But what are the top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2145">ten devices on an aggregated level in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2145">Play Store? That I don't know. And it might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2149">be the case that the top app &mdash; device on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2149">my app might be fifth in the global stack </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2155">ranking and I might be leaving a lot of money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2155">on the table because my app really doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2161">do well on the top devices on a global ranking. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2161">Is there any way I can get access to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2166">data? </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2166"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: So short answer, no. But the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">aim is that you shouldn't be focusing on particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">types of devices. You should be making sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2173">your app works across all devices, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2173">in the same great experience. So don't worry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2180">too much about specific devices. Try, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2180">know, to use a beta testing feature. Try to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2186">reach more users on different devices to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2186">sure it works well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2188">You know, if you're doing some really sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">of cutting-edge stuff, we've seen people, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">you know, really push the boundaries of 3D, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">and sometimes that causes problems. You know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2197">you can look at the crash reports section </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2197">in particular to find out if there's a problem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2201">device and how best to fix on it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2201">But definitely don't try to optimize your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">app for a specific set of devices. You know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">make sure it's a great experience for everyone. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2213"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2213"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: John (saying name) with RadarNow! USNaviguide. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2216">I have some APKs in my developer console that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2216">are years old and essentially abandoned. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">now with the rollout of the beta feature, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">I'm going to have all these beta versions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">of our apps stuck out there. Is there going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">to be a feature to archive or delete, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">know, old and abandoned APKs? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2230"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: Yeah, this is also a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">popular request. I saw some applause over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">So it depends. So right now, many of you may </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">not know this, but if you have not published </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2242">an app, you can delete it today. Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2242">So if you go to the developer console, on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">the right-hand side, there's a little, I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">know, gray button, and you can select "delete." </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2252"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Well, these are, like, apps that &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2252"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: I know. If you've published </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">them, I totally hear you on that. I see a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">lot of feedback. It's definitely in the top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2258">ten things that we're seeing coming in with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2258">the feedback. So we hear you on that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">I guess with the alpha and beta, just to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">really clear, those are in the same store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2266">listing, so it's not going to litter up your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2266">app page anymore. But we definitely hear folks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">who have apps that they don't work on anymore, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">and they kind of want to hide that. So we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2274">definitely looking into that possibility. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2274"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Well, I have beta versions for testing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2276">And now &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2276"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: Okay. With different package </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2280">names. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2280"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yes. Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2280"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: Okay. I see. Yeah, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2280">definitely heard that. I guess we're not announcing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">any changes today that are happening there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">But we've definitely heard that as a top ten </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2287">request. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2287"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks very much. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2288"><span class="speakerName">Riccardo Govoni</span>: Is that just something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2288">that you would like to hide from the applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2292">list? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2292"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yeah. It would be okay if we could just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">archive them so they're not sticking there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">right in our face every time we go in. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">know, I mean, sometimes also it would be good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">to order, be able to order the list so that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2303">the ones that we're using and that are popular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2303">at the top instead of, I don't know exactly, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2307">you might have it alphabetically now or something. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2307"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: I think it's alphabet, yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2311"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: But archiving, just archive, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2311">hide or something. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2314"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: Yeah, a lot of folks have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2314">wanted to hide the unpublished ones, like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2317">once they're not using it anymore, to hide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2317">them. So we definitely have heard that one. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2321"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Great. Thanks very much. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2321">Oh, I love the comments thing, by the way. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2325">I've had it for a year. It's great. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2325"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: Oh, yeah? Awesome. I'm glad. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2329">The back. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2329"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi. My question is about staged rollouts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2331">and how do you determine which percentage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2331">of users is it? And is it the same percentage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2335">of users each time or is it different? So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2335">when you release new versions of the app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2340">is it always going to be that same 10% that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2340">you're going to be &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2343"><span class="speakerName">Riccardo Govoni</span>: So &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2343"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: So it's random per staged rollout. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2349">So by that, so when you're rolling out a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2349">version, we sort of have a different random </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2354">seed to select which 10%. But we keep that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2354">seed during that rollout process. So if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2360">don't want to push that out to 100%, you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2360">to place it in another APK. Those original </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2365">10% will get the update. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2365"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So you can have, then, 2 &mdash; like, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2368">can have a 2.0 to everyone, a 2.1 to 10%, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2368">and a then 2.2 to a different 10%? Is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2374">possible? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2374"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: No. There's only one staged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2375">rollout at any time. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2375"><span class="speakerName">Riccardo Govoni</span>: So anytime you do a staged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2378">rollout, we pick a different part of the population. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2378">So, you know, it's not the same guys that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">get the same testing APK stack. But during </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">a staged rollout, if you decide that the particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2386">APK needs changing, then you can change it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2386">and the same group of users will receive that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2391"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. Great. Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2391"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: And also, to clarify, staged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2393">rollouts, not for testing. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2393"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yeah. Sorry. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2395"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2395"><span class="speakerName">Miles Barr</span>: Only staged rollout when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2397">ready for everyone to get it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2397"><span class="speakerName">Ellie Powers</span>: All right. So it looks like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2400">we basically have five seconds left. But don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2400">worry. I still see some folks wanting to ask </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2404">questions. We're just going to head back to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2404">office hours. And don't forget that there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2407">a monetization section here in an hour, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2407">in &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2412">[ Applause ] </span></p></div>
