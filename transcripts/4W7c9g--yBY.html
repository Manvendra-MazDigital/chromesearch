<h1>Google Chrome Extensions: Launch Event (part 4)</h1>

<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/4W7c9g--yBY">youtu.be/4W7c9g--yBY</a><div id="transcript"><p><span class="line" data-startTime="0"> KAY: So, I've talked a little bit before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">about UIs. So, let's talk about &mdash; back a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">bit about the UI philosophy behind Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">and how it applies to extensions. So, as I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">said, we're aiming for a very streamlined </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">and integrated user experience. The phrase </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">that Brian mentioned earlier is that we use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">a lot inside the team is “Content, not Chrome,” </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">what that means is that we want people to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="19">be able to focus on the content of the Web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="23">I mean, when people use a Web browser they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">are interested in getting to the Web. They </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">don't care about the Web browser; really that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">just window dressing. And so, we'd like that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">to disappear in to the background as much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">as possible. So, these also apply &mdash; this philosophy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">also applies the types of extensions that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">we think about that we want to enable. Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">Extension should be more about helping you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">discover content on the Web, or helping integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">content in with the browser better and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">sort of thing. So, let's see, let's talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">the some of the surfaces &mdash; we already talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">about the browser action a little bit, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">we only touched on one of the basic features, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">which is just having an icon that you click </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">on and an action happens. We actually packed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">a bunch of other little features here. If </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">you look at the Gmail Icon he’s got there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">you can see there's a little counter in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">corner. That's dynamic. It's overlaid on top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">of the icons that we compute, so you can set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">the color and put some text in there and rotate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">through. So, in this case, it's really useful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">for showing the number of unread messages. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="83">Also, that image that the icon itself is totally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">dynamic. So, you can, you know, animate through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">a sequence of images if you'd like. And you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">can even do that completely well and continuously </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">in some cases. In this case, actually, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">isn't like a pre-computed set of static images. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="102">These are done generated on the fly dynamically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">with the Canvas object from the background </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">page. So, we have a single bitmap and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">rotating it through and setting it down. In </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">addition, browser actions can have a pop-up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="120">What a pop-up is it’s just an HTML content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">that is sized dynamically or automatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">in this little bubble that’s attached in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">the bottom. So, you could see when he clicks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">on one of the stories and then it expands, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">the bubble expands with it. We dynamically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">sized it based on the content and in Real-Time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="132">Now, this is useful for more than just wheezy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">animation. This is also really useful for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">things like localization. You know, you might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">have a word that in Chinese only two characters </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">and in German are fifty characters. I'm trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">to design a UI, a size, and all that layout </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">that works well in all those environments </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">is pretty hard. So, having to size it dynamically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">for you is going to be a real time saver for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">the developers. Another surface we have is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">similar to a browser action. We call it a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">“Page Action.” Page Actions appear instead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">in the omnibox rather than in the toolbar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">there. They have allotted the same features, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">the dynamic icon, they have pop-ups. But the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">thing that's different about them is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">they come and go based on the content of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">page. A browser action is meant to be a permanent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">part of the browser UI, something that’s </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">always balanced, and something that will work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">all the time. Whereas the Page Action says, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">“Well, let me look at the content of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">page. And if it's appropriate, I'll show it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">myself.” In this case, this Netvibes extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">detects RSS feeds on the page and only if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">there's an RSS feed does it show the icon. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="197">There's one more surface that is I sometimes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">forget because it's so &mdash; it's sort of the ideal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">minimalist surface, which is the page itself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="213">So, we have a functionality called Content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">Scripts, which allows you to inject JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">and CSS into the page itself and modify its </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">contents, maybe doing overlays or highlighting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">stuff. And this is an incredibly powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">feature and allows you to add UIs. So, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">take a look at a simple example, something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">you may have seen before. Here's Google Image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">Search and this is just it with no extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">hooked in, but I'd like &mdash; I got an idea for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">an extension that will take all of these images </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">and turn it into a nice pretty slide show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">for me, so... </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="243"> BOODMAN: That is a good idea. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="246"> KAY: Yeah, let's &mdash; well, good thing we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">thought about it before and I already have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">it. So, let's just enable that one and reload </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">the page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="252"> BOODMAN: Boom. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="252"> KAY: Okay. So, you see at the bottom here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">a little sliding scroll view appears and there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">are some nice little animations that you hover </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">over the individual images. And now, if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">click on the one that you want, you see it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">as a nice fade in transition of the martial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">arts kittens there. And as it goes pages between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">them, it shows your nice animated slide show. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="271">And the &mdash; can never go wrong with kittens. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="279">So, okay. So, those are the UI surfaces that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">we have exposed. We did spend a fair amount </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">of time as well on the management and administrative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">UI of the extension system as well. We wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">it to be as frictionless and out of the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">as it could be. So, install, uninstall, auto </span><span class="line" data-startTime="304">update, we don't want to barrage you with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="304">a bunch of dialogues, a bunch of questions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">as you're going along. So, basically, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">one or two clicks to install, the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">doesn’t have to restart, you don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">to, you know, God forbid, restart your computer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">you know, it just works for both uninstall </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">and install. And update is totally silent; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">it uses the same technology that we use for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">Chrome to keep itself up-to-date and can happen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">live and in place while you're using the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">even. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="335"> BOODMAN: So, you wanted to show a demo? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335"> KAY: Yeah, yeah, why don't we install one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">of those and check it out. So, here's one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">of our samples that we had from way back when, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">little Page &mdash; a Page Action that shows the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">map. And it tells you in the dialogue what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">this extension can do. And this one, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">injecting Content Script in the page, so it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">tells you it has access to the pages that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">you're surfing to, so you install. And as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">the Page Action, remember I said that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">Page Actions come and go. This one is based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">on whether there's an address on the page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">or not, this page doesn't have an address </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">on it. So, we actually at install time, always </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">show the icon briefly, so you know where the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">UI is going to appear. So, it's not a mystery, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">so you don’t &mdash; so you know what to expect, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">and a little explanation about which extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">just got installed and how to get back and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="386">how to uninstall if you'd like. So then it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="386">disappears and we're done. Okay. So, as I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">mentioned before, speed is really important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">to the Chrome team. It's something that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">think about in almost everything we do. We've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">got performance tests for most of the code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">in the project. And the idea is that every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">time that the developer checks in code, these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">performance tests run and we can catch when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">things slow down as a result and fix them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">before they get released to the public. Extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">are no different. Basically, we wrote some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">tests that installed 50 little extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">and SAJA that affected startup time and page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="428">load time as we cycle through a whole bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="428">of different pages from our sample set. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">when &mdash; so, we can catch these things when it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">regresses, but it &mdash; in addition to catching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">regressions, it also allows us to measure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">experiments. Things what we think will improve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">things. So, for awhile while we're developing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">Content Scripts did slow down page load time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">a little bit, especially if you have a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">of them. And one of our engineers, Anthony, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">had a great idea for how to make that faster </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">and Aaron knocked out a quick test for it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="460">And this is actually a real graph from our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">test when that happened. And you can see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">prior to this, the green line was much slower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">than the blue one, which is with the &mdash; just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="471">one Content Script installed and &mdash; but after </span><span class="line" data-startTime="471">the fix, it went down to, basically, being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">about the same. So, it's &mdash; this sort of Real-Time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">very fast turn around in performance testing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">is really important to us. The other reason </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">why extensions perform really well in Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">it's because of our multiprocessor architecture. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="487">So, if you're looking in Chrome’s Task Manager, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">this shows you what all the processes are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">that in use by Chrome. In addition to every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">Tab being a process, every extension is also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">a process. So, it's isolated from the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">and isolated from each other. But this means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">is that one poorly behaving extension doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">slow down the browser. The browser can run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">independently. It doesn't slow down other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">pages. It doesn't slow down other extensions. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="514">So, the demo of this, we're going to install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">or enable them, a badly behaving extension. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="519">This extension is just going to spin the CPU </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">as fast as it can. And try to suck up all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">the resources, this would normally, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">bring, you know, bring your system to a halt, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">but let's see what it does to Chrome. Now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">he has enabled it. It's there. But you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">see that he can drag the tabs around. Everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">is still animating very smoothly. He can pull </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">out the tab. He can scroll around and read, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">and do what he needs to do. And it doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">look like anything is going on. But let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">take a look and see what's happening. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">if he brings out the task manager again, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">can see there's just one extension there that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">taking up 50% of the CPU. It's only 50% not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">100 because I think his laptop is dual core. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="557">So it's hitting one of his cores completely. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="561"> BOODMAN: I should use Web Workers then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">I could use both. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="562"> KAY: Yeah, it's true. I should have thought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">of that, man. So anyway, it sounds great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="570">The browser is still interactive but he is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">on a laptop and it's probably getting warm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">about now. You can hear his fan turning on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="574">So it'd be good if he could stop the offending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">extension. So, one way you can do it is in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">the task manager, you can just kill it. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">see something that's, you know, acting badly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="583">You can always just kill it in Chrome and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">the browser will keep going, that's fine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="587">But in this case, I think it’s better for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">us to just uninstall it and get rid of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">bad actor. So, let's just get rid of it, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">there it goes. It’s all done. Okay. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">let's talk a little bit about security. Extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">have access to what you're doing with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">browser. So, it's really important that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">build security in from the beginning. Really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">think this through. We worked pretty closely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">with the Security Researcher for Berkeley </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">named Adam Barth, who works with us on and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">off in the Chrome project to help really build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">something robust. And we're really proud that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">he just published a paper recently about our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">security model. And we think it's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">be received pretty well. When we were thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">about the model, we really thought about two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">different use &mdash; two different threats that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">we were trying to deal with. So, there's one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">threat, which is if there are buggy extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">out there. They are written by well-intentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">people. They're not trying to do harm to you, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">but they have bugs. And because of those bugs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">maybe they could be exploited by the attacker. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="651">The other case is that you are an actively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">hostile attacker, somebody who is really trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">to do harm and trick you into downloading </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">a bad code. Now, we spent more of our time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">on the first case. The reason we did this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">is because far and away, this is the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">common problem in security on the net right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">now. Is that, you have people who write, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">know, they're writing code as a hobby, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">know, or it's &mdash; they're not security experts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">to begin with, but they wrote something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">got really popular. And somebody comes along </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">and exploits the security holes that it has. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="684">Security is really hard, so, you know, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">all write bugs. Software isn't perfect. Although, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">I should say I'm sure nobody in this room </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">writes bugs but, you know, but it does happen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="695">So, how do we deal with those bugs? Well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">we got a few strategies for how to prevent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">problems from happening. First, we use the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">principle of least privileged. What this means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">is that extensions only can do the minimum </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">that they need to do in order to do their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">job. They declare upfront what permissions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">they need, what host they need to talk to, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">which browser APIs they want to use, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">have to put that in their manifest. Uninstall </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">time as a user you can see what does this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">extension do and know that it should never </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">be able to do more than that. That even if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">it has a bug that an attacker won't be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">to trick it into doing something else. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">also used a console called privilege separation. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="734">This is taking advantage of our multi-process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">architecture and saying that the lower privileged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">extension processes are separate from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">higher privileged browser process. So, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">means that those higher privileges can't leak </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">down into the extension, that even if, again, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">if it has a hole, it can't get access to these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">extra things. So, I talked a little bit before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">about Content Scripts. Now, Content Scripts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">are &mdash; as those of you who are familiar with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">Greasemonkey and the related feature user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">scripts are aware of are very powerful things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="766">And they have the potential of being kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">of dangerous as well. They can potentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">break the page that they're injecting into, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">or they can actually accidentally grant the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">page more privileges than the page originally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">should have had. So, we protect against this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">using a new technology what we call “isolated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">worlds.” What an isolated world is, is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">way of separating the two things. We have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">a separate context that the JavaScript from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">the Content Script runs in and it keeps it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">separate from other Content Scripts and from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">the page itself. So, the variable names and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">the functions, they don't interfere with each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">other. And the page can't even find or get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">access to the variables and the functions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">inside the Content Script. Finally, when those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">bugs do happen, it's important that the developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">be able to push out auto-updates as quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">as they can. As I said before, extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="818">use exactly the same auto-update mechanism </span><span class="line" data-startTime="818">that Chrome uses itself. It's been hugely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">successful in helping us mitigate problem, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">you know, fix security problem very quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">for Chrome. And when they've come up, we push </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">out results and get people updated within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">hours or days. And the same thing is available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">now to all extension developers and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="836">built into the product. Also, the extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="836">are all signed with public photography (ph). </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="841">So, that ensures that only the author of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="841">extension can push out updates to it. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">let's talk a little bit about the hostile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">case again. As I've said, we're more concerned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">about the &mdash; about the buggy case but &mdash; because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">in the end, extensions are going to be powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">software, and you should only install them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">from people you trust. Somebody could install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">something, it does something. You couldn’t </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">install something that would do something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="867">bad, but we do protect you from a certain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="867">level of these problems. One way is using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="873">the Sandbox. So, take our multi-process architecture. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="873">So, each extension has its own process and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">just like normal Chrome tabs, these processes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">are Sandboxed. This means we're using the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">operating &mdash; underlying operating system functionality </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">to limit its functionality. So, an extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">process can really only do what the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">gave it permission to do to begin with. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">this means it can't talk to the network. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">can't talk to the file. It can't talk to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">registry. It can't do any of the things which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">would let it be become really bad and persistent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">in your machine after the fact. You can always </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">uninstall an extension when it’s misbehaving. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="908">Finally, if a bad extension does make it down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="908">for a while and somebody reports it to us, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">we have the ability to blacklist that extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">and disable it after the fact. So, when that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">happens, people who mistakenly installed this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">bad extension will have it disabled and few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">people in the future won't be able to install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">it. So we have a pretty small set of designed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="931">principles but we think about them in everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="931">we do in the Chrome Team. And when you applied </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">them to the extensions project, I think we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">were able to build a pretty robust, easy to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">use platform that &mdash; it's a lot of fun to use. </span></p></div>
