<p><span class="line" data-startTime="0"> Dan Heberden: Hello. As you have been looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">it at for 15 minutes, I'm Dan Heberden. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="6">enough about that. I will get my slides up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="6">here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="11">So this is bower, at least the very basic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="11">beginnings of what you would start to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">where you just run bower install jQuery and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">you see that it went and got jQuery, installed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">it for us in the current folder. What we didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">have to do is specify a version. We didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">have to find out what the latest version is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">or whatever one we wanted. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="39">And what does getting jQuery look like for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">you? Or I mean really any library, but jQuery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">is a good example. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="44">Oops, sorry about that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="51">Does that mean going to jquery.com and downloading </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">that? Does that mean going to the github repo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">and looking for maybe a built copy? Do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">have to clone the repo and then build it with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">their build tools? Do you memorize URL and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">use wget or curl and pull it down? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">Bower helps because it makes installing tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">much easier. And it uses a manifest file to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">declare what it is that you actually want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">to download or to use in your project. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">those downloads are centralized into a commonplace, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">which are very helpful, and it by itself resolves </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">dependencies. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="96">So before I get into all the pieces of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">bower is, I would like to show you what it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">looks like with a canon of other tools, a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">full suite. And so Yeoman and Grunt are required, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">yes, are great tools. If you haven't gotten </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">a chance to look at them or learn about them, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">I really recommend diving into them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="121">But we are just going to run a quick example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">to just show off some stuff that bower can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="127">So first we would do is get Yeoman. Yeoman </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">is just a scaffolding tool that lets you define </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">&mdash; there's a couple generators out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="138">There are, like, 16 that it comes with and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">then a bunch more that help you scaffold typical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="142">And the typical application we want to scaffold </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">is a requirejs app. So we can just get generator-requirejs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="145">You can do this yourself but it is kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">nice to get everything already to go without </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">having to do a lot of work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="158">I will show you what that looks like. Just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">make a quick &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">so assuming I have gotten those two things, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">I can just run Yeoman with required requirejs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">and it will do a couple of things. It will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">ask me some questions, what I want the app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">to be called. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="179">We are just going to make a quick weather </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">app. So we will say my-weather-app and a default </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">description. Now, I'm not going to hit enter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">now just because that's going to go through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">and download everything from NPM and everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">from bower and everything that we need. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">I don't really trust the WiFi. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="192">So I'm going to just change to the baked cake </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">in the oven. And we can see actually &mdash; I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">will just do this &mdash; that it already gave </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">us a lot of stuff just out the gate. It gave </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">us an app directory with requirejs config </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">file that calls the main file here. And we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">can &mdash; it just says jQuery in there, but we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">can put anything in there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="220">But it also did some other stuff. It set us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">up with Grunt. So we have concatenation and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">minification, js hinting and that kind stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">already set up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="231">It made a packaged JSON; and it did put our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">name in there for us, which is really convenient. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="235">So some nice convenience measures. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="240">So let's go ahead and actually write some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">stuff. Now, for making a weather app, probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">someone has done the work of getting weather. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="247">I'm sure actually thousands of people have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">probably done that all by theirselves without </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">even looking to see if anyone has done that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="257">So let's just use bower, and we'll search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">for weather. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="261">I will make that a little bit bigger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="261">So it looks like Dan Heberden, I don't know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">who that guy is, but he made a weather thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="268">And I'm going to trust it for the sake of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">this presentation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="277">So, I can just install bower &mdash; or use bower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">to install weather. And I will save that to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">my configuration file. If you have used NPM, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">that's the same kind of thing. We will talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">more about what these pieces mean. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="293">You can see here it went in and got the weather </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">component. It also got the stuff that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">component needs, which is jQuery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="301">And so now if I go back to my application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">here, I not only have the things that were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">part of the original application, requirejs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">and jQuery and Qnit, but I also have my weather </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">module. So let's go ahead and use that. Since </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">this is an AMD module, I will just jump over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">into my main file here; and I can just reference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">it directly. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="332">Hop back to my slides. That is not the right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">slide. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="350">There we go. Okay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="362">So in our app, we would put in some HTML for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">our actual weather information, just temperature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">and status, that kind of stuff. And then inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">of that, we can use that weather component </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">that we installed. So we'll just use require </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">to get that and typical AMD stuff here, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">nothing too crazy, and make a function that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">actually uses the position object that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">weather API returns with temperature and condition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">and that kind of stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="397">And then actually get our current position. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="397">So we'll use geolocation, get our current </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">position, and pump that latitude and longitude </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">into our weather module. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="408">I have the finished product here. Hopefully, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">this will work with the connection. So I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">a connect server actually part of this whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">suite here, which is nice via Grunt, so I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">can start a Web server on local host. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="426">You see here that that worked pretty well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">out of the box and was able to make a server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">connection, do all that stuff, but we didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">have to worry about finding this module and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">putting it in. We were just able to take advantage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">of it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="456">Let's look at what happened here, and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">is the bower.json that was generated from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">what we did. And we have a requirejs and JS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">dependencies that came out of the box. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">when we installed weather, it also added that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">version here. The tilde means it is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">to keep the minor version. So if that goes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">to 0.2.4, it will go ahead and install that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="478">So we looked at kind of a quick demo of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">that would look like using that with other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="488">I do want to show you one really neat thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">since I have this up. And that is using all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">of these tools together. And this is mostly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">just a plug for Grunt and how well it does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">all of this stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="501">I just ran every task that is set up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="505">this, so I'm hinting. I'm running my test </span><span class="line" data-startTime="505">suite. I'm getting all of the dependencies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">via requirejs and putting them all together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="511">And now I'm concatenating and minifying all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">of that together. So my original uncompressed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">file of 326K is now 23K. That's pretty cool. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="527">So if you aren't doing this or haven't looked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">in these kind of tools, I highly suggest doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">that. One HTTP request to get all of the site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">running. That's pretty neat. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="539">So why a clientside package manager? When </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">using clientside tools should be easy. I mean, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">sure going to hotscripts.com and finding some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">script was really fun ten years ago. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="557">There's a problem with open and public code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">being committed into repositories. And I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">know about you, but I don't really like waiting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">for github to download gargantuan repositories </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">all the time. What happens is older and buggy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">versions of libraries or frameworks or plug-ins </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">get stuck in projects, and it is harder to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">work around getting a new one in there. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">then there is a hesitancy to use an existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">solution because it is kind of a pain to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">out and find what's available. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="583">When you do find out there is a great plug-in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">or piece, you have to go find out what it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">needs to run and that can be a hassle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="593">Bower, of course, makes it awesome, hence </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">this talk. Let's look into bower. Let's look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">into what pieces it has that will help you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="599">We saw installation before. We can just install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="606">a component and it will go and grab all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="606">that stuff. It will grab all the pieces, put </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">that into our folder. We can also do that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">via manifest files. So we can declare what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">we want, run bower install, and it will just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">go through that manifest file just like NPM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">and get the pieces that are required along </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">with anything that those pieces require and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">anything those pieces require until it has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">everything that you need. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="632">And, of course, if you edit the manifest file, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">we want to change this &mdash; say, there was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">bug and we want to force version 0.2.0, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">can do that and run bower install and it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">go get the right files and make sure everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">is okay as far as dependencies go. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="649">Now, if you want to do this from the command </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">line, you can do that pretty easily just by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">putting in the module name that you want and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">then a hash mark and then a version. And that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">will do the same thing if you need to do that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">from the command line. In this case, we want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">jQuery 1.8.0. And so we can force that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="663">And you can manually edit it, that's fine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="674">But we have this same as NPM &mdash; save and  &mdash; savedev </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">and those let you just express what you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">to install but also put that into your manifest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">file because chances are you will want that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">any time you recreate this project or someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">else clones this project and gets it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="696">But at this point, bower is mostly just a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">glorified URL shortener. Like, this is nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">but this isn't really what's really going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">to help you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="705">So upgrading is where bower also shines in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">making your life a lot easier in dealing with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">clientside libraries and frameworks and plug-ins. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="710">Since required packages don't have to be committed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">into your repository, it makes discoverability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">and it makes working with these libraries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="726">much easier. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="726">Check out bower ls. It gives you a quick look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">at what your current project looks like. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">so in this case, we just installed jQuery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">1.8.0, it is going to let us know that 2.0.0 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">is out and that we can look into upgrading </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">to that. We didn't have to go to the jQuery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">site or make sure we follow the blog. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">this is for any particular plug-in or piece </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">that you follow. But it also hunts down the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">dependencies just to make sure that everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">is fine as far as what it requires as well. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="757">So we have a nice map of what our project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">looks like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="763">Bower update will take the current version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">and install it to the highest minor version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">possible. So in this case, it will go to 1.8.3. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="769">And that's nice if you want to just make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">that while there shouldn't be any problems, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">run the test suite, give it a run-through, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">and then make sure you can deploy your site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">using these latest versions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="784">Let's talk about the power of bower.json, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">having something that expresses your clientside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="789">needs in your application. And the easiest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="789">way to do that is this: Just obliterate the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">components directory. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="797">And, of course, this would cripple your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">all together. And it is just as easy as running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">bower install to get all of that stuff back. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="808">Now, bower is just a package manager. Bower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">doesn't give you minified code. Bower doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">concatenate things. It doesn't load modules </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">for you and it won't. You say what you want, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">and bower gets it. Because there is plenty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">of great tools out there. There is tons of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">build tools. There's tons of things to help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">you do certain tasks. Bower doesn't need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">do that for you. But what it does need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">do is play well with others. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="838">And so since it is written in JavaScript and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">since it is a node library, you can just require </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">it and do the same things that you can do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">from the command line, search, install, look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">at what packages are available, and control </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">it from maybe a custom build tool that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">have, or Grunt. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="853">Another thing that is really nice and available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">for you is the plug-in that Ben Schwarz made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">for Sublime Text. I am not a Sublime Text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="873">user so I might bumble around this a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="873">bit. But I wanted to show you what this could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="878">look like. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="878">Actually, let me do this from here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="887">All right. So here's a typical Sublime project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="887">And the typical way that you run the built-in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">tools, command-shift-P. When you install this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">tool, it adds a bower &mdash; can't really change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">the font, unfortunately, of that particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">part of Sublime. I don't think so. Nope. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="922">But what it lists there, if you can't see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="922">it, is bower: Install, bower: Configure project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">and bower: Discover packages. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="927">And so from here, I can run bower install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">and that gives me kind of an interactive search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">so I can look for Angular and find that package </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">and install it right from Sublime. So I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">even have to hop into the command line, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">I don't want to. Of course, if you have Little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">Snitch running, it will ask you every time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="950">but that's okay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="950">Just from Sublime, I was able to add something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">into my bower.json file and it downloaded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="956">it into my components directory where I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">Angular now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="964">So that's pretty nice. But there is another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="968">tool that this exposes, or links to, rather, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="968">which is Discover Packages. So sindre made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="977">this, sindresorhus on github and Twitter. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="977">This is a search Web site for bower where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="986">you can take a look. And you can do the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="986">thing, Angular, and get some available metrics </span><span class="line" data-startTime="992">about what matched that search, when it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="992">last updated, how many forks and stars, a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="997">little bit more information to help you make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="997">a good decision about what piece you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1002">to add in and discover things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1002">Currently there is 2,048, so exactly 2K components, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1010">which is fantastic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1010">Let's look at the Angular stuff just really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">quickly. I have a quick demo about what that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">could look like, if you aren't a requirejs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1020">fan or if you just like Angular. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1020">So we're making a typical Angular app. Have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">our namespace in the HTML, my app. And show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">you the basic template of HTML. And we will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">go ahead and install that Angular component </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">that's available. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">So add our Angular script into our project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1053">And then add some basic module codes, so we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">depend on my app and create a controller. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1061">And this is going to make an itemized list. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1066">So we see the UL up at the top. It is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">to make just a repeatable list element &mdash; or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">list item based off of this item list. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1071">But let's say that we want to make this actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1078">work with markdown instead. And I'm sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1078">there's some kind of markdown Angular thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1087">that's existing out there. So we can search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1087">for Angular and just parse out anything that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1092">mentioned markdown. And we can also use this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1092">Web site here or use Sublime text. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1107">Angular markdown brings up the same thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1107">Whatever way you choose to get there, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">can. And so at the end of the day, we install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">that Angular markdown directive. And we see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">that it installed Showdown. That's what it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">requires for the markdown parsing. And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">we have Angular, of course, which is the directive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">piece &mdash; or what it depends on to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1128">run. We already installed that, so it doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1128">matter. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">So now we have our three components that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">need to add which is Angular itself, the markdown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1136">parser, and then the Angular markdown directive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1136">So we can add that module now as a dependency. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1147">It has already been included as a script tag, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">so it is now available. So we can include </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">it just like we would in a regular app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1152">Make sure that we specify that this item will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">be parsed using that with the btf markdown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">down here, the latter part of that li. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1167">And then just add some markdown. So in this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">case, on the last item we're just making that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">some pretty basic markdown. And what that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">looks like &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1190">this is the full HTML. That got really big. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1190">This was the full HTML that we have now that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1196">was generated. These are our components all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1196">installed. Angular, angular markdown, directive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1201">and showdown. Bower is updated with the two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1201">pieces that we need. And there's it running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1218">those three items through the generator and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1218">it is parsing markdown. So that didn't take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">a lot of work to go hunt down these pieces. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1224">Imagine that part where you find out, yes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1229">there is an Angular director for parsing markdown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1229">and now I need to get showdown. Now we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1234">to look where they put their built file. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1234">are well aware that could be on their web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">site. That could be in some DIS file in their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">GitHub repo or in their source file but you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">are not quite sure which one it is. And that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">gets complicated and that takes time and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1251">is a particular barrier of entry to use that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1251">particular plug-in. But that is also time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1257">you don't need to spend. There's also a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1257">nice component or ability of being able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1265">work with a directory that's managed by a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1265">tool and that is, if we go back to our step </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">three here, so I have my Bower.json file. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">If I want to see what my app looks like with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">a particular piece, I can just install any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1287">version I want. If I want to test, say requirejs3 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1294">comes out and I want to test that with my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1294">application, I can just install that using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">Bower. And if my whole app just completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">explodes or I find a bug and report it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1305">requirejs on I install JQuery 2.0.1 and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1305">find a bug, I can report that bug. I can help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1313">the community. I can help those projects that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1313">I depend on. But then I can just switch back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1318">to the version that I need and it wasn't a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1318">big deal. I didn't have to, like, rename jquery.old.js </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1326">and put in the new one. If you have ever done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1326">that &mdash; I know you have &mdash; you don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">to anymore. So we never had to hunt down Angular. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1332">We were able is to find everything really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">easy and most of all the scripts are in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">consistent place. Now, we looked at the JS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1350">demo earlier. I was using components as the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1350">full path. Components weather then weather.js. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">You can use &mdash; there's a Grunt contribution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">plug-in for that that actually adds those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1363">to your path automatically. So I could have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1363">just had JQuery and weather and it would have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1367">just worked. There's tools out there. Bower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1367">has a lot of pieces to integrate with Rails, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1374">with different node build tools. There's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1374">lot of community around making it integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">with whatever word process that you have. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1380">So what's coming up? There's a lot of great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1388">stuff that we looked at but obviously there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1388">room for improvement. We're not perfect. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1394">is still a new project. And so some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1394">things that we want to do are hosted packages. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1400">We want you to be able to authenticate with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1400">the registration server. We have started working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1404">on this. You could rename a package if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1404">added one or delete it. You would be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">to push a copy of a built file if you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">want that maybe in your repository. You can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1417">push that up to us directly. And, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1417">we can give a cached copy. If you don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">git or you want that even faster, we can just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">push the file that you want down, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">really helpful. Andre, who is the lead developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">for Bower, Marco and him have been working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">on a rewrite of Bower to make it faster, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">make it easier for us to work on and add better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">features. So this is the quick video he made. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">Let's go full screen here. I'll probably pause </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">it. It's a really short video. So this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1453">his dependencies list. These are pretty big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1461">pieces. These are a lot of pieces. This is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1461">pretty indicative of a typical real-world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">app as far as how many components are there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1467">So what he has here is on the left is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">to be with the rewrite and then on the right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">is the current version. And so those run. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1485">Bower just goes to town getting everything. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1485">So you see on the left it is already much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">faster. He was able to get all of that content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1496">in just 8.8 seconds, whereas the current one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1502">is 13. And then if you have cache, which Bower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1502">has, once you've actually done this once and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">you've gotten &mdash; most of these repos are using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">across different projects, it's now down to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">2.3 seconds versus 5.7 on the current version. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1517">And then, you know, that time you are on a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1525">plane and you need to recreate the project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1525">and you know you have all that cached, one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1529">second. So this isn't a big commitment as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1529">far as having a process around getting these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1537">packages. Running, even on the current version, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1537">it's still pretty fast and it's only going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1543">to get faster and it's only going to get better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1543">And so working this tool into your work flow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1549">not only should make your life easier but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1549">it should do a faster job of hunting down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1553">all these things for you than you possibly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1553">could. As developers, that's the whole point. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1557">Of course, working on the regular stuff, more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1557">docs, less bugs. Unless you want more bugs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1566">I guess we could put them in. And more packages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1566">and more integration. That's really the biggest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1573">piece of this, is we want to make Bower something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1573">that works with &mdash; that is extendible to work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">with any tools and we can just write whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">middleware, whatever plug-ins to make it work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1584">so you can take advantage of it in the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1584">that you see fit. We can focus on just getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">packages, getting stuff for you in a sane </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">way. But we need help with that. We need help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1598">on Bower. We need help with these pieces and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1598">so github.com/bower, all the pieces that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">working on are there. Bower IRC channel and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">freenode, definitely come in. Chat with us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1611">and let us know if you are running into any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1611">problems. We have a Bower Google group and, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">that's it. So I think we have &mdash; the timer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">was going pretty crazy, so I'm not sure exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">what it all means for time. But I think I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">have time for questions. Anyway. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1630">[ Applause ] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1630">I should note, too, that if you want to, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">have a bunch of Bower stickers and if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">liked the logo, which is pretty new by Dave </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">Dessandro, a pretty neat logo. If you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">to support that on your laptop or child's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">forehead, definitely come up and get a Bower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">sticker. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1661"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So this is awesome, really awesome. I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1661">haven't used it yet but I definitely would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">love to start using this on my projects. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">this kind of is all the client side components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">and so on and usually all our projects are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">&mdash; have, you know, server side and client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">side together. Is there &mdash; I don't know how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">to &mdash; is there any sort of integration between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">different kinds of service side packaging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">systems as well or packages? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1690"><span class="speakerName">Dan Heberden</span>: The integration, that's where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">we want to make sure that as a developer you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1695">are the one calling the shots. And so a good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1695">demo of this is actually my &mdash; this presentation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1705">So I hooked up &mdash; which ended up not working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">that great because there's a lot of network </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">connections in here. But I wanted to hook </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">up my phone so that I could have the next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1714">slide show up on my phone. So I wanted to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1714">use socket.io, and so looking at that, I was, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">like, I better use Bower because I'm writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">a talk about Bower. And so if I have my node </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1729">modules, I have socket.io, so in this case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1729">I know I need socket.io on the server, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">I just add that to my package.json. And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">Bower search socket, give you a few different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">ones available. You can see there's a client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">available to get. So it's still going to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1748">two separate pieces because they will be two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1748">separate libs, but having the ability to hop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">between the two really ease easily and have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">NPM installed and Bower installed as part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">of your process. When you showed Yeoman earlier, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">that actually runs both for you as well. Even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1765">if you are building something that scaffolds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1765">an app that you maybe build in often, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">can have that as part of your work flow of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">just, okay, here's my server side components, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">here's all my client side components. Go. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1773"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I guess we can always script if you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">just a single install, get everything from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">scratch, whatever script these components </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1784">as well. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1784"><span class="speakerName">Dan Heberden</span>: Yes, that's why I look at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1786">Yeoman generators or something similar to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1786">do that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1790"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1790"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi, I had a question. We use Bower at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1796">our company and one thing I noticed is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1796">when you Bower install something like Bootstrap, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1802">you get, like, 15 LS files and 15 JS files </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1802">and it's not built. Is there any way to integrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1813">with Bower to have it, you know, automatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1813">build that as soon as I download it? Some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1819">packages actually do have the build files, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1819">you know, in the source. But just looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">for a way to kind of improve that work flow, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">I guess. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1829"><span class="speakerName">Dan Heberden</span>: Yeah. There's a &mdash; so Bower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1829">won't be the tool that builds that because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">you can imagine that might be a make file. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">In the case of Bootstrap, it is a make file. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1840">That can be node, whatever. So there needs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1840">to be a way to make that built version available. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1846">Now, the way that Bootstrap does it, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1846">actually hide it in the docs folder. So, like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">you go into docs, that's where the built JS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">and CSS files are. What we have been working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1856">on is, there's a main property inside of Bowers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1856">a manifest file. So we are working on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">spec to bring that to more light so that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">actual file that you want is not only highlighted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1867">to you, here it is, but even, like, possibly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1867">moved to root or something that makes that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1871">easier. Also, the hosted part will mean, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1871">you have a complicated build process, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1876">can publish your built copy if you don't want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1876">in your repo. Like, I like it in the repo, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1882">I think that's a cool thing. Obviously, not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1882">everyone agrees with me. We are working on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">that for sure. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1886"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Great, thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1889"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Can I use my own modules that are not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1889">in the directory, for example, in the Bower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1893">file? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1893"><span class="speakerName">Dan Heberden</span>: Yeah, if you want to &mdash; so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1896">if it's something in the corporate environment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1896">you don't have. You don't want to publish </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1900">certain things or you have private code, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1900">can reference any git repository and just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1907">specify the git URL and a tag. So actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1907">when I was working on &mdash; oops &mdash; on this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">So code mirror is, like, man, I don't want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">to have to commit this into project. Of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1929">click, I'm writing a talk about Bower, I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1929">use that. I was just able to point it to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1934">get repo for code mirror. It just pulled it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1934">for me. So even without someone going through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1939">the work of making their project Bower compatible, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1939">I was still able to just throw it in there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">and use that so you can use that and specify </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">a tag if you wanted to for a specific version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1950">of that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1950"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1954"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: On the server side, you have the luxury </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">of, if two modules require the same thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1959">but have different version requirements, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1959">can just load them as dependencies of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">dependencies and each one gets called in for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">the correct spot. On the client you can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1969">run JQuery 1.4.2 for one module and 2.0 for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1969">another module. So what's the solution on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1976">the client side for mismatched dependency? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1976"><span class="speakerName">Dan Heberden</span>: That will show up on the Bower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">LS. But it's going to ultimately be your decision </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">to mitigate that. Because, like you said, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">there's no easy way out. And so that's where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">you making the decision of what to do and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1994">which library is going to be the correct one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1994">or will work. We're working on finding out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">the best way to do that. Like should our process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">stop altogether and say there's a conflict </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">and you have to resolve this first? Or should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">we just carry on and hope that you can figure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2009">it out yourself. We're working on some better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2009">feedback on that. It's still, like, it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2014">still show you that we have two different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2014">versions and you are going to have to figure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">out which one to put in. But that's where, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">again, the developer needs to be the decision </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">maker and Bower doesn't want to be &mdash; doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">need to be a tool that forces you into a box </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2030">in particular situations because you might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2030">be very well aware, oh, this person just didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2034">update their dependency list. I guess that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2034">it for questions. Thank you very much for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">your attention. Come get a sticker, if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">want. </span></p>
