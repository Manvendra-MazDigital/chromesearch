<p><span class="line" data-startTime="46">Second, I want to just talk a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">little bit about how we relate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">to the world of research and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">innovation outside of Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="55">Most of you are part of that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">world, and you're essential to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">what we're trying to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="60">Third thing is, as a panel, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">we'll talk about things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">are of interest to us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="65">What we're working on, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">and what are our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">views of the future? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">At the end, let me just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">mention it now &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">there will be a survey. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="73">Please fill it out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="74">We are requested by the powers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">that be to ask you to do that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">and we would indeed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">like you to do it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="80">On the panel, and you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">in front, on your right is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">Thad Starner, who is at Google, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">and also a professor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">of computing at Georgia Tech. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="90">He is the TLM &mdash; the technical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">lead manager &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">of Google Glass. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="94">So you can imagine kinds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">of things that he'll be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">interested in talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">with you about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="98">Computer vision, virtual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">reality, machine learning, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">image and video and the like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="104">Next to Thad in the gray shirt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">is Peter Norvig, who is our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">director of research here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">in Mountain View. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="111">He headed search quality at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">Google at one time, in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">very early days of Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="115">He's an acknowledged leader in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">artificial intelligence, has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">co-written the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">popular book. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="121">Also, he created, with Sebastian </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">Thrun, the AI course </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">which got MOOCs going. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="128">How many of you took Peter's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">AI course in the room? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">So you all know Peter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">very well &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">or not all of you, but &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">Ah, Peter recognizes you all. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="137">Yes indeed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="138">And then on your left is Jeff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">Dean, who's a Google fellow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="143">He's been at Google for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">quite a while &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">was involved the earliest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">days of implementing our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">advertising systems, and has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">been, really, a pillar of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">strength and of creativity in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">creating the distributed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">computing infrastructure at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">Google with Sanjay Ghemawat. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="156">They invented MapReduce. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="159">And he's a member of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">National Academy of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">Engineering. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="161">And recently, Sanjay and Jeff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">won the ACM Infosys Foundation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">Software Systems Award. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="167">I think that was the research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">systems innovation of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">decade 2000 to 2010. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="173">That's my view. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="174">And we can hear about what Jeff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">is currently working on &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">MapReduce 2 or 3, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">or I don't know. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="179">We'll find out when he talks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="182">So just to start, as I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">about research at Google, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">most interesting thing for me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">is that if we think of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">Google mission statement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">to organize the world's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">information and make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">universally accessible and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">useful, it's basically a candy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">store for computer scientists </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">and related disciplines. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="200">Statistics and mathematics and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">related aspects of engineering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">and the like. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="205">There's so many problems in our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">field that are included </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">within that, and understanding, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">and building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">very large scale systems, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">security, and user experience, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">dot dot dot. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="218">So virtually every problem in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">the field is subsumed within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">that mission statement, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">we get to go work on it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="225">So that's sort of the really fun </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">part of being at Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="229">The second thing that I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">makes Google research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">interesting is that we blur </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">the boundaries between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">research and engineering. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="236">And why is that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">Why don't we believe that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">should have some number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">people isolated in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">room somewhere &mdash; a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">very nice room, maybe &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">thinking great thoughts, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">inventing the future. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="247">And then we'll go tell the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">engineers what to go do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="250">We don't believe that for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">a number of reasons. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="254">One reason is that building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">systems &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">building large scale systems &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">requires every bit as much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">creativity as a new idea on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">how to go do something. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="264">So there isn't a differential </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">in terms of creativity, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">terms of hard work, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">intelligence, et cetera, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">oftentimes in building something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">in a way that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">really valuable and useful, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">in thinking of the idea. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="277">A second reason, I think, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">that our field, computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">science, and of course, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">engineering related fields as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">well, is increasingly an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">engineering discipline, not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">just a mathematical discipline, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">and also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">increasingly a field </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">which is empirical. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="297">So our field, initially, if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">think about it and go back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">to the earliest days, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">was very significantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">mathematical &mdash; the work of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">Turing, mathematician, really. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="305">A lot of von Neumann's work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">was mathematical. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="307">There was ever increasing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">engineering as we built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">fancier and fancier hardware </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">devices and software stacks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">and the like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="314">So engineering became a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">big part of the field. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="317">And then in the last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">10 to 20 years &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">really since the advent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">of machine learning &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">it's become an empirical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">discipline, which means access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">to large scale data, lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">usage, and large scale is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">really important to the field. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="332">So now there's a tripod </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">under the field. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="334">So if you separate research from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">all the data in usage, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">you skip a lot of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">engineering, and particularly, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">you skip the empirical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">nature of the field. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="343">So we think you can't do that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">and that has motivated or kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">of blurred the boundaries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">between research and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">engineering approach. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="352">Slav Petrov, Peter Norvig, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">I wrote a paper in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">communications of the ACM last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">summer called Google's Hybrid </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">Approach to Research where we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">made these arguments as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">clearly as we know how. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="364">So what it leads to is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">situation where we are we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">organize, what I would say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">opportunistically, in whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">way makes the most sense to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">accomplish something. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="373">So sometimes it makes sense. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="374">We have a very goal driven </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">effort that's product driven, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">like, say, Google Glass. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="379">There's an awful lot of research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">that's needed that in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">order to make that really work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">right, but it makes sense to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">let that go off and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">do its thing. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="387">Google X does that, and to think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">about it as part of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">goal directed activity to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">produce Google Glass. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="394">Sometimes it's a technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">based effort. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="396">Sometimes we don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">a specific goal. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="398">We want to improve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">a technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="400">And sometimes we do that in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">conjunction with existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">systems, when we want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">improve, say, recommendation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">algorithms in something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">that we're doing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="409">Or it may be something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">that's new. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="411">We have a better way of doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">OCR, and we think we do, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">we have a separate team that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">separate from the engineering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">team to a large degree, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">we think we have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">better approach to optical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">character recognition. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="421">So we organize in whatever way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">makes sense, and we all work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">for the same company, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">and there's an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">enormous amount of fluidity. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="427">Part of the reason it works is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">that we treat engineering with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">enormous respect across the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">whole business, as I said </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">earlier, and we feel that our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">engineering team is enormously </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">talented and capable of whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">classes of challenges </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">that we have, whether invention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">of new things or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">making things work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="448">Last thing I would say about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">Google research &mdash; and to those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">of you that are researchers, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">hope this isn't problematic &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">we view that good research is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">defined by impact, not by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">publication. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="459">So publication is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">part of impact. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="461">A good publication is extremely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">important, so we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="464">certainly endorse that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="466">So we endorse peer reviewed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">publications that are cited by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">lots of people that change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">the nature of the field. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="472">It's an excellent way of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">information dissemination. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="475">But in this day and age, unlike </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">the day and age of, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">say, Sir Isaac Newton and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">Royal Society when this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">started, it's a different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">world. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="482">There are other ways of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">disseminating information. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="484">So open source. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="485">I would argue that the Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">open source release or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">Chromium open source release </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">are fantastically valuable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">publications which teach an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">enormous amount of the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="496">Indeed, standards are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">publications that codify the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">best practices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="501">And they're also, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">extremely useful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="504">And indeed, our products and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">other people's products also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">are forms of publication and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">engineering discipline, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">because they push the state of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">the art, and they declare a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">state of the art. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="513">And usually people sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">understand why they work, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">that indeed sets a new level </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">underneath the field. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="519">So we all try to achieve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">impact, and we measure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">ourselves based on impact, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">inclusive of papers, but other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">things as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="528">By no means do we do everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">ourselves. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="531">We strongly support and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">work with universities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">on a regular basis. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="573">The open source world is also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">extremely important to us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="576">So we are large supporters </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">of open source. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="579">Large amounts of the code that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="579">we use are based on it, and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">contribute large amounts of code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">to the open source world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="586">One of our most innovative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="586">programs there combines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">education and open source. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="590">It's the Summer of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">Code program. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="591">Any of you know about this? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">Google Summer of Code? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">So there, we support large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">numbers, usually of fairly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">young students in the summer &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">1,000 to 1,500 &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">that work on open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">source projects. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="735">But essentially, the idea is we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">never told the system what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">a cat was, and we built a system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">where at least one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">the neurons in the system was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">very selective for whether or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">not it contained a cat. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="746">That's not that useful in and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">of itself, but it turns out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">the vision system that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">build, when you pre-train it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">with this kind of thing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">is actually quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">state of the art. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="756">And we've also been applying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">this to speech recognition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="759">So we've been collaborating with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">a speech team to deploy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">deep neural nets as the acoustic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">modeling portion of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">our speech recognition systems, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">and that's given very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">significant reductions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">in [INAUDIBLE] rate. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="771">And then we're looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">interesting representations of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="774">text, where you represent words </span><span class="line" data-startTime="774">in very high dimensional </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">spaces, so that similar words </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">are close together in a 1,000 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">dimensional space or something, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">and that seems like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">a pretty important and powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">way of reasoning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">about text. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="790"><span class="speakerName">Peter Norvig</span>: OK. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="792">My main efforts lately have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="792">been in online education. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="796">We built a open source system </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">for creating classes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="800">We just had the fourth release </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">last week, but I won't say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">anything more about that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">because right after this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">session, in this room, I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">going to talk about it in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="809">another session. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="810">So stick in your seats if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">want to hear about that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="813">Instead, I'll talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">something just because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">yesterday I was talking with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">one of the team members who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="819">was so excited that they had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="819">their launch here at IO of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">music recommendation system. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="825">And this, in some ways, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">similar to the type of thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="829">Jeff was talking about, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="829">that it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">machine learning system. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="833">And I think maybe the main point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">isn't that it was music, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">because we didn't really have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">that many experts on music. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="841">We had people who like music. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="843">But the exciting thing is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">we have a process for doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">that type of learning. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="848">So we start to say, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">what do we have? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">Well, we've got the raw files. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="854">They've got sound waves, we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="854">got the four-year transform of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">those sound waves, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">gives us some input. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="861">Then we have the metadata. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="862">We have what's the title, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">artist, and so on, the genre </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">of the music that's sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">associated with that track, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">and we have the meta metadata </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">of everything that's been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">written on the web about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">those artists. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="875">And then we have the social data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="875">of people who like this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="878">one also like that one. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="880">And from that, and from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="880">processes that we built up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="883">saying we know how to gather a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="883">lot of data, we know how to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">store it, we know how to process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">it in a distributed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">fashion, and we know some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">mechanisms for building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">machine learning systems, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">we were able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">come up with something. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="896">And I've been pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="896">happy with it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="897">I've been playing with it and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">comparing it to other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="900">recommendation systems, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="900">for me, it does better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="903">Maybe I like weird </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">kinds of music. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="905">But it does a great job, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">it's just a demonstration of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">how far you can get by applying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">this methodology of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">learning from data. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="949">You learn short term memory </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">through the process of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="951">learning language. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="952">And so the deaf children I work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">with get neither access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">to English, because they can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">hear, or sign language, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="958">because their parents don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="958">learn sign, until they get to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">kindergarten. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="962">And that means that while you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="962">and I might be able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">remember five digits, like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">say, 45156, the children I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="968">work with can remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="968">two digits. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="970">And that affects them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">for the rest of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="971">their life, most often. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="973">It's a barrier for education, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="973">it's a barrier for jobs, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">a barrier for life. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="977">So what we're trying to do is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="977">create applications that help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">hearing parents of deaf infants </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">learn how to sign. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="986">We have an application you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="986">see coming out later on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">Android on the Play that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">is called Smart Sign. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="992">It allows parents to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="992">lessons in little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="995">microinteractions throughout </span><span class="line" data-startTime="995">the day where they'll get a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">new sign that is shown to them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">on their cell phone. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">Right now, I have a sign </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">linguist who works with me at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">Georgia Tech. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1004">He's betting that it's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">be even better with glass. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1006">He wants to have pop up little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1006">sign language lessons </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">throughout your day, depending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">on what context you're in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1013">You also, if you're working with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">an older child, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1016">don't know what sign that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1016">need, you can actually say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1020">OK, Glass, what is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1020">sign for horse? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">And it shows it to you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">in your eye piece. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1026">So that way, you can actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">use the sign while you're in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1029">conversation with your child. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1031">Another thing we're doing is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1031">making a game that helps these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">deaf children acquire language </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">skills, and we're actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">using computer vision to track </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">the hands and actually verify </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1041">that they're signing the right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1041">thing to progress in the game. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1044">It's called Copycat. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">If we combine all of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">things together, with humans </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">in the loop, continually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">providing feedback, do our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">systems become, really, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">all way intelligent? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">Is that sufficient? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">And you could call that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">combination hypothesis, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">something I have been calling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">it for a decade, that as we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1121">combine all of these different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1121">things together, different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1124">technologies that years ago, AI </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1124">people would've fought and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1126">said, that's not important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1128">We don't need that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1129">We'll just do this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1130">I think we need them all. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">And if we do them all, will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">that yield what we want? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1134">We'll be able to take an image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1134">and write a textual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">explanation of what that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">image is about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1140">Not just, there's a face, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1140">there's the Empire State </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">Building, or whatever. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1143">But can we describe what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1143">we humans would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1145">say about that image? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">When we do a summarization of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">a paragraph, can we not just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">be sort of heuristically clever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">and pull out a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">subjects and objects, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">can we really get the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">right tenor of it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">Can we actually get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">the negations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">correctly, et cetera? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">It's a good question. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1161">It'll be very interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">to see how far we go. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1164">What I feel today about that is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1164">we have an enormous amount </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">of runway to push this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1169">So I think the kinds of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1169">demonstrations you saw in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">morning when you talk to your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">machine and it tells you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">things you want to know &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1175">I think they're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1175">to go really far. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1177">But how far, we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1177">know, I think. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1180">And I think that's one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1180">really interesting open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1182">questions that we, and I hope </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1182">all of you in the research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1185">world, are looking at as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1187">So let me turn to a different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1187">role here, and I will play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">moderator as best as I can. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1194">All right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1196">What's the distinction between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1196">research within the research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1199">group and research within </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1199">the rest of the company? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1201">Peter, why don't you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1201">take that one here? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1203">You've been doing research and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1203">being in the company and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">everything for longer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">than I have. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1208"><span class="speakerName">Peter Norvig</span>: I guess we try not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">to make a big distinction. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">We do have a separate research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">group, but whether you're in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">research or in engineering is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">more driven by what area </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1220">you're working on than by how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1220">researchy you are, and whether </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">you were a professor, or how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">many papers you want to write, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1227">and those kinds of things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1229">So when I was running search </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1229">quality, that was in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1233">engineering organization, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1233">and so everybody I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1234">hired was an engineer. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">And it didn't matter how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">many PhDs they had. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">If you're working on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">an engineering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">project, you're an engineer. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1242">If you're doing something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1242">we aren't doing yet, then we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">can call you a research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">scientist. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1248"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: I think that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1248">probably answers that one. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1251">I'm going to click yes. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">Where can we read and/or learn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">about current non-secret </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">Google research projects? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1261">Non-secret. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">Well, that's good, because if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">they're secret, I think we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1264">know the answer to that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1266">Jeff, do you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1266">to try that one? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1267"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Dean</span>: Sure. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">So on research.google.com, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1268">there's actually a link to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">recent publications that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">have made, categorized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1276">into a whole bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1276">different areas. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1278">So that's one way. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1282">People at Google often give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1282">external talks that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1284">videotaped, so you can find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1284">those on the web about less </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">fully developed work that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">not quite ready for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1290">publication. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1292">I think going to conferences </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1292">is another good way. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1295">We often publish papers there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1295">chat with people informally at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">conferences, sort of the normal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">way that the research </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1303">community collaborates. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1306"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: Right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1306">And indeed, there is a G+ Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">research group that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">can subscribe to, and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">also something that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1313">Research at Google is what it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1313">called, I believe, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1316">So you should subscribe to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1316">that as well, and I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1318">you'll see a lot of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1318">we're doing there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1322">Let's see. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1322">The next question is, Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1322">is hard to approach </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">externally, both for figuring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">out who is working on a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1330">specific problem, and for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1330">knowing what you're getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1333">into when you apply for a job. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1334">How should academics </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1334">form successful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1337">interactions with Google? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">All the team members here are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">looking at me on this one. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1341">I guess I don't get to delegate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1341">this one here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1344">So it's a fine question. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1346">I mean, we are either happily or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1346">regrettably a big company. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1351">Lou Gerstner once said, every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1351">little company wants to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1354">big, and every big company </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1354">wants to be little. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1356">There's some truth in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">that statement. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1357">So it would be nice if we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1357">little, and then you'd know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">who to talk to, because there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">are only 10 of us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1361">I think that the best approach </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1361">is actually to find someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1366">you know at Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1366">and talk to them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1369">I'm guessing that most of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1369">know somebody at the company, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">and I would try to vector </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">through them to find someone. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">I think this is still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">a personal world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1379">We're all humans. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1380">We talk. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1380">We send email, and chat, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">and such things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1383">I think that's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">a very good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1385">approach for doing things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1387">But then you could also vector </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">off of the various things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1392">we have on our websites and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1392">find out from there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1395">So I think that's probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1395">the best approach. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1397">Maybe we need to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1397">a system for this or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">something like this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1399">I don't know. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1401">All right, let's see. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1403">Is a Ph.D. Degree a must for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">doing research at Google? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">Can external people contribute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">in some way even without </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">joining the team? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1412">Anyone want to take that one? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1414"><span class="speakerName">Peter Norvig</span>: Yeah, I guess </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1414">I could take it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">So I think a Ph.D. Is indicative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">of the kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1420">person that we like to hire &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">a person who's shown that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">have a passionate interest, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1426">and that they can carry through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1426">work over the period </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1429">of many years, and come up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1429">something successful. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1432">And so getting a Ph.D. Is a good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1432">way to demonstrate you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1435">that kind of person. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">But if you can demonstrate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">it some other way, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1438">that's just as good. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1439">We don't really care if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1439">you have the degree. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1442">We care what type of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1442">person you are. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1444"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: Right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">Absolutely. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1448"><span class="speakerName">Thad Starner</span>: I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1448">add to that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1450"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: Great. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1450"><span class="speakerName">Thad Starner</span>: Again, as Alfred </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1450">was saying, there's not much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1452">distinction between engineering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1452">and research, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1454">oftentimes, some of the best </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1454">research is people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">transitioning from engineering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">into doing something with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1460">research teams, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1460">can come from any level </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">background. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">It's more about being able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">do the work and having the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1465">intellectual curiosity and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1465">discipline to do it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1468"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Dean</span>: I'll even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1468">add something. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1470">One thing I find, even in my own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">work, is that I go through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1473">cycles of working on a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1473">exploratory thing where I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">doing more research, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">as that sort of comes to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1479">fruition, hopefully I'll bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1479">it closer to actually building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1482">a real product out of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1483">And that sort of shifts what I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">do to more of an engineering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1487">thing, where I know what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1487">needs to be done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1489">And then when that's sort of at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1489">a good spot, then I go back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1493">and find some more researchy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1493">thing to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1495">And so even individual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">people kind of cycle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1497">through this continuum. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1499"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: Right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1501">Can external people contribute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1501">some way even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1503">without joining the team? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1505">The answer is, we have quite a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1505">few collaborations going on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1508">externally with folks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1511">It often works well when open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">source platforms are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">basis, because then intellectual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">property issues </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">don't get in the way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1518">But there's an awful lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1518">of that at Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1520">We do an awful lot in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">open source community. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1523">So I think so. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1524">When there's deep IP involved, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1524">then that's always </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">challenging, and there's just, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">I'm afraid, no way around it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1531">But we do, in fact, collaborate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1531">with thousands and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1534">thousands of people through our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1534">open source platforms that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1537">either we lead on or that others </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1537">lead on and that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1540">contribute to. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">All right, who is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">our Steve Jobs? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1546">And who picks who &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1550">this looks like who singular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1550">picks the big ideas, or is it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1554">distributed? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">Jeff, you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1556">try that one? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1558">Or maybe everyone should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1558">answer that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1559"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Dean</span>: Sure. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">I mean, I think it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">combination of things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1562">One is a lot of times, new ideas </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1562">come from someone just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1567">tinkering on their own and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1567">exploring some new thing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">they think Google should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">be doing, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1573">that we're not currently. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">And a lot of times, those sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">of prototypes or ideas become </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">full fledged projects that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">really push the company </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">forward in some area. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1583">And other times, Larry or Sergei </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1583">will say, why aren't we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1587">doing this? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1589">And then that will sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1589">of form a team. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">It's a combination of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">things, and great new ideas </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1595">come from all over, so it's not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1595">like we wait until Larry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1598">says we should do this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1601">But if he does say that, he's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1601">often right, and you should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1604">pay attention. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1608"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1608">generally our strength is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1611">actually that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1612">distributed, to a large extent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1614">Certainly, and you heard Larry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1614">yesterday, he's encouraging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1618">big things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1620">So we are possessing a CEO now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1620">and with Eric as well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1626">that has encouraged really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1626">significant results that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1630">benefit lots and lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1630">users in the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1633">So he's always done that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1635">He's always pushed for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1635">discontinuities. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1637">So that's a big role </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">that he plays. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1639">But Larry can't do everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1639">himself. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">He'd be the first to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1642">tell you that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1643">So he depends on many of us to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">have good ideas, and to come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">up with things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">we want to go do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1649">And some of them arise, as Jeff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">said, sort of naturally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">from an existing project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1657">That's, I would say, probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">the most common thing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1659">happens is something sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1659">just sort of obvious to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1662">next when you're doing a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1662">project, and a lot of what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">do is undoubtedly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">based on that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1667">All right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1668">Last year, Google's CFO </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">mentioned at an innovation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">conference in Montreal that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">Google's mantra is to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1676">sure each project is capable of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1677">affecting one million people. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">How do we balance this reach </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1679">with research and revenue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1683">generation? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">Well, I think some things start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">small and grow, and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1693">think that's the answer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1694">And we don't always know which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">ones will do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1696">So we certainly are desirous of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1696">doing things that are truly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1701">impactful, and we're a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1701">big company, so our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1704">standards are high. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1706">But we don't really know which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1706">ones are going to do that, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1709">we start some things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1709">that don't work. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1711">And we don't know. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1713">There are numerous efforts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1713">that I'm involved in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1716">Some you see, some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1716">you don't see. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1718">And we don't know if they'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1718">work, which is the nature of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1720">engineering and research. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1721">You don't know. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1723">You must see that in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">the Glass world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1725">There's some things you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">try, and don't &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1726"><span class="speakerName">Thad Starner</span>: One of the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">is, there's so many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1727">niche things you can do with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1727">wearable computers that aren't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1731">going to affect a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1731">million people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1734">They could be $100 million </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1734">businesses, but they're not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">the big win you expect. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1737">And you try to make the product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1737">such that other people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1742">go out and do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1743">You try and enable it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">not close any doors. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1745">And you try and make sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1745">the academics who are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1749">interested in accessibility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1749">can do what they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">want with the device. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1752">People who are interested in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">industrial things like repair </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">and inspection means that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">they can do what they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1757">want with the device. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1758">Try not to shut anybody out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1761">But it also allows people to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1761">really explore quickly, grow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">quickly, and see where the big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">hits are going to be, not just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">at Google, but out in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">world in general. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1899"><span class="speakerName">Thad Starner</span>: So I can take both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">of those, because these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">guys don't know what I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">working on the space. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1903">So this is another example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">where we're trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1908">specifically keep Glass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1908">open for people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1911">who in these spaces. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1913">A good friend of mine at Georgia </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1913">Tech, Gregory Abowd, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">works very much with autism, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">and we're reaching out to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1921">academics right now with Glass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1921">to try to give them early </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">access to the device, and to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">some of the inner guts, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1928">they can actually use it for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1928">these particular things. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1931">And you'll see Gregory using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1931">it, not just in future. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1934">Now, as far as the feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1934">extraction. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1936">So Weka is really great for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">when you have, say, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1939">comparing two images together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1941">One of my specialties is in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1941">time sequences, and we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">doing something called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">pattern discovery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1949">One of the things we're looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1949">at right now is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">looking at birdsong, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">trying to pull out the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">fundamental units of birdsong. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1955">We're looking at dolphin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1955">vocalizations, trying to pull </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">out the fundamental parts of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">dolphin vocalizations. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">It's very hard to do, but you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">can see some of that in a PhD </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1966">thesis by David Minen that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1966">you can download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1969">and take a look at. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1970">And that's for time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1970">varying signals. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1971">And that looks for things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1971">that are repeated. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1976">And you try to explain time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1976">by what's called motifs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1981">And if you're interested in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">that, come talk to me later. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1983">It's one of the things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1983">we're very much interested in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1985">As a matter of fact, it's why I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1985">got into wearable computing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">in the first place. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1987">I'm trying to &mdash; and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">is something I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1989">should tell Alfred about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1990">One of the reasons I started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">wearable computing was I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">really wanted to make a computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">that sees as we see, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1994">hears as we hear, tracks the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1994">motions of our hands, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">discovers the activities of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">our daily lives, learns to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2000">string those together in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2000">sort of scripts and frames </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">standpoint, and actually learns </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">what it is to be human. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2006">Not just what it is to describe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2006">a particular image, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2010">but actually the meaning of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2010">it in the human world. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2013">With that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2014"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2015"><span class="speakerName">Peter Norvig</span>: Let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2015">me add to that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2016">We do have a service called the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2016">Prediction APIs, where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2020">ship us your data and we run a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2020">suite of algorithms over it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2024">and we send back classifications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2024">or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">regressions. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2027"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: That's a cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2027">service you can find if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2029">type prediction API Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2029">or something like that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2031">You'll see how to use it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">And it's meant to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">quite easy to use. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2034">It's just as Peter said. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">You give it some data, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">give it some examples, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2038">train, and then off you go. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">All right, let's see. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">I think in the back was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">the first question. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2043">You. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2044">Yes, you, sir, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2044">the blue shirt. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2048"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: My company works </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">with education, so I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2051">privileged to see every day the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2051">impact the tools that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2054">build, the work that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2054">you do has on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2056">students and parents globally. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">And I think it's quite profound </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">how the tools you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2063">build enable social change. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">I'm curious whether at Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">research you look at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">impact of social change, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">what it means, for example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">for things like collaborative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">consumption. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2074"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">actually know &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2075">does everyone know the word </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2075">collaborative consumption? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2077">I don't know that term, so could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2077">you define that for us? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2081"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: I'm not sure. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2081">There's probably experts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2081">in the room. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2083"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: Briefly, yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2084"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Briefly. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">The idea is a lot of the tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">we build, particularly in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2087">Silicon Valley, are geared </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2087">at consumption. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">Collaborative consumption is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">about building things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2091">communal gardens. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2092">It's about ways of using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2092">resources we already have in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">way that's shared. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2098"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: OK, got it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2098"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Autonomous cars, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2098">great example. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2101"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: So the way I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2101">would put that is I think the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2103">group that's most interested </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2103">in topics like that is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">google.org's engineering team, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">which is extremely interested </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2110">in how we can use technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2110">to be a lever to improve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">governance, participation, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">democracy, to try to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">greater transparency in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">government, to make energy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">consumption more efficient, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">allow for grids to be more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2129">effectively managed and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2129">utilized, and the like. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">So I think those would be the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">places where we are doing work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">that's most related to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">in google.org, so you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2138">could check into that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2140"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2140"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: Yes, sir, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">in the orange, or red. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2142"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Hi there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2143">Peter from Toronto. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2145">It strikes me that if any team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2145">is capable of bringing SkyNet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2150">online, it's this team. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2154">My actual question is, how often </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2154">do ethical debates arise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">in decision making? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2164"><span class="speakerName">Thad Starner</span>: First </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">conversation I had with Sergei. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">I've been doing wearable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">computing for 20 years. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2173">Part of my daily life. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2174">And one of the first things we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2174">did is said, OK, here are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">things are probably going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">to happen, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2180">let's build out slowly. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2181">Let's have small communities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2181">using this who can actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2184">get familiar with how these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2184">devices can be used in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">socially appropriate manner, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">and then let's build it out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2191">larger and larger and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2191">scale these things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">And so I think it comes up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">routinely within Google, from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2196">what I've seen. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2198"><span class="speakerName">Peter Norvig</span>: Yeah, we were able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2198">to get down from Asimov's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2200">three laws to one law &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2200">don't be evil. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">But it is a constant struggle to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">try to interpret that, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2209">say, if we make a move in one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2209">direction, are the outcomes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2214">going to be good or not? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2215">And to do that, you have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2215">look ahead many steps. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">And we keep trying to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">a better job of that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2223"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: Just in my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2223">thinking, there's an enormous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2226">amount of distribution of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2226">thinking about those issues </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2229">throughout Google. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">So it's not that there's a group </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">of ethicists somewhere </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2232">that rule on things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">I think all of us as engineers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">and scientists in Google think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">deeply about what are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">consequences, pro and con, of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2240">what we might do? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2241">How can we mitigate the con </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2241">and maximize the pro? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">And just speaking as a member </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2244">of the National Academy of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">Engineering, those of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">who are engineers, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2248">should all do that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2249">It should be part and parcel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2249">of our code of ethics as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">engineers that we do no harm. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2260"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: My name is Vajay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2262">So my question is, so it used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2262">to be that Google presented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2266">search results and relevancy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2266">irregardless of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">individual, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2271">And now there's a sense that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2271">relevancy depends on who is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">asking for it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2277">So the way I look at the current </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2277">way of thinking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2280">the Knowledge Graph and trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2280">to assess semantics from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">broader amount of information, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2284">that's sort of done at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2287">moment, or my impression </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2287">is, done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">irregardless of the person. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2291">And I'm wondering, on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2291">research team, what the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2296">philosophy is behind the balance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2296">of how semantics are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2299">determined based on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2299">individual, as opposed to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2304">entire corpus? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2306">I don't know if that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2306">makes sense. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2308"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Dean</span>: Yeah, I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">take this one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2310">I mean, I think really, you do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2310">want personalized results. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2314">Because if you know, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2314">example, that I like spicy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2317">food, and I query for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2317">restaurants in some new town, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2321">it should bias those results </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2321">to my interests. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2324">And so there's a bit of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2324">tension between how much do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2328">you weigh those personal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2328">interests for some new query </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2331">you've done or some new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2331">information need, and what the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2335">general populace thinks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2337">And I think there's a variety </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">of different levels at which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2341">you do this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2341">You can adjust things based on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2341">the language someone speaks. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2345">You can adjust it based on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2345">the country they're in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2346">You can adjust it based on their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2346">current location at a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">very fine grain level. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2351">Are they standing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2351">in downtown Palo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2353">Alto, or in San Francisco? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2354">That could affect things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2354">quite significantly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2357">And so it's a constant not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2357">really tension, but you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2363">really trying to balance all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2363">these different factors, and a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">lot of it is data driven. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2367">So you try to understand when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2367">you want to weigh certain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2371">personalized factors much more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2371">than in other circumstances. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2381"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Dean</span>: That can also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2381">be machine learned. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">So you can do a lot of machine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">learning on the kinds of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2386">actions people take. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2387">Like, we do a lot of online </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2387">testing of different kinds of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2391">algorithmic changes, and look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2391">at those sorts of &mdash; </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2424">So it would have been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2424">very difficult &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">we thought about releasing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">our MapReduce software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2429">We really thought deeply, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2429">particularly when Hadoop was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2431">coming out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2432">But it was so intertwined for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2432">reasons of optimization with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2435">the rest of our stack that it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2435">was actually very difficult to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2438">consider doing, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2438">we didn't do it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2440">So I would say there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2440">no rule of thumb. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2442">The difference between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2442">research and X? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2445">Xs tended to focus on a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2445">collection of topics that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2448">not things that the rest of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2448">Google is already doing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2452">So that's the differentiation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2452">between X and other innovation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">that's been going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">on at Google. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2457">That's a rule of thumb. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2458">I can't say it's hard and fast, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2458">but that's my impression </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2461">of what the differences </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2461">are, and I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2462">it's generally right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2464">Last question here that I had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2464">is does research develop end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2467">user products or prototypes? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2470">And the answer is yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2472">OK, now we can take the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2472">two questions if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2473">we want back there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2474">We do both. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2475">Go ahead. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2476">You need to find a mic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2478">I didn't mean to dismiss </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2478">the two folks that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2479">had stood so long. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2481">I apologize for that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2531"><span class="speakerName">Peter Norvig</span>: Yeah, I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2531">agree with that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2533">I think we're getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2533">more contextualized. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2536">A computer is not something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2536">that you go to to use. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2540">It's something that's around you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2540">all the time, and sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2545">more integrated into your life, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2545">rather than being a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2547">separate thing. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2574"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: So we've seen some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2574">recent announcements on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2576">Google's involvement with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2576">quantum computing, and I'd be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2579">interested to hear the viewpoint </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2579">on the classes of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">algorithms, the problems that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">can solved, and the usefulness </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2585">of that at Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2585">in the future. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2589"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: Well, so I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2589">think no one really knows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2591">exactly where all this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2591">is going to go. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2593">I don't think we truly know, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2593">it's gotten to the point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2597">where it definitely may very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2597">well be interesting. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2600">There may be classes of programs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2600">that this D-Wave </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2603">architecture actually is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2603">plausibly good at solving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2607">relating to, say, image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2607">and such things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2609">So we're trying to learn. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2611">We're trying to also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2611">push the future. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2613">We want to contribute not just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2613">the technologies that are ripe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2616">for harvesting tomorrow, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2616">in some cases, for the ones </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2619">that will be important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2619">in the longer term. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2620"><span class="speakerName">Jeff Dean</span>: Yeah, I think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2620">still pretty early. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2623"><span class="speakerName">Alfred Spector</span>: All right, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2623">guess we're going to get the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2624">last question, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2624">you're &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2626"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Is there any kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2626">research going on combining </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2630">Glass technology with connect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2630">technology, where like, person </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2634">in front of you doing sign </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2634">language, and then it spits </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2639">out your language saying, like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2639">there's some kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2646">translator in between? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2649"><span class="speakerName">Thad Starner</span>: I think I can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2649">comment on any of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2651">those sorts of things. </span></p>
