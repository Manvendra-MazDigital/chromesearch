<h1>Google Chrome Extensions: Launch Event (part 6)</h1>

<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/4kGeyMkhFdQ">youtu.be/4kGeyMkhFdQ</a><div id="transcript"><p><span class="line" data-startTime="0"> BAUM: Thank you. These are really great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">extensions. Hi. My name is Nick. I'm the Product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="5">Manager on the Extensions Project. And I'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="5">like to tell you a little bit about the gallery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">that we launched yesterday. So first, let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">me close down some of these tabs. And I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">also going to head over and uninstall Aaron's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">extension. Not because I don't like it, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">because I have a secret plan. Let me go ahead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">and do that. And now, let me go to our gallery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="32">So, let's search for gopher. We weren't lying. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="32">Here is Aaron's extension. It's getting pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">good ratings. So, maybe I should report it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">as spam now for having a fake description, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">but actually what I'm going to do is I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">to try to install it, and there we go. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">I promise that this isn't because we had someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">behind the scene is furiously approving this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="63">Actually, we think that one of the great strengths </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">of our gallery is that most approval for most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">extension is absolutely automatic. So you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">don't need to set away around for one of us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">to go and check on it. Now, of course there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">still extensions that might be abusive and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">so if we receive a report about that, we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">go and take it down. Same thing if an extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">violates our terms of service, we'll go and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">take it down. But the nice thing is you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">have to wait for us when you post your extension. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="90">You can just get it live right away. There </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">are a couple of exceptions to this policy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">namely: extensions that use native code and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">extensions that access the file system. Now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="102">for security purposes, we do send those to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">manual review. But this review is as simple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">as signing a copy of our terms and sending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">that into us. We've seen very few extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">uses so far. So I think it's a testament to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">the flexibility of the system already. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">when those we have seen have gotten approved </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">very, very quickly. So we think that this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">is really a big game for developers. As you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">saw, you can write an extension for five minutes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="127">You can get it up in a minute. And start distributing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">start testing, and start getting users. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">second thing I'd like to tell you about today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="137">is a little bit about how to make your extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="137">successful in the gallery. We think there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">are three things you can do to make your extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">really do very well. First one, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">is to build a great extension. The second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">one is to pay attention to how this extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">shows up in the gallery. And the last one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">is to promote that extension yourself. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">let's go through those in order. Building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">a great extension, that one is pretty obvious. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="166">At Google we're very focused on the user. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="166">We think that the products have best meet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">the needs of the user, at the end of the day </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">win. And we think the same applies for extensions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="174">And in fact, we'll be tweaking our ranking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">algorithms and the extensions we featured </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">to constantly try to give an edge to those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">extensions that are helping users to really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">browse the Web and enjoy the Web better. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">second one is about making your appearance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">in the gallery as good as possible. I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">illustrate with an example. So, let me pull </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">up an extension that I find particularly pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">here, which is the glue extension. The glue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">extension allows you to get social recommendations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">for movies, books, music, and other media. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="208">And you'll notice that this looks a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">bit different from Aaron's extension, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">Aaron I'm sure will polish his up later on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="212">You'll see that we've made it incredibly easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">to actually make a very beautiful extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">page. We let you add large screenshots. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">let you add a description and we even let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">you add YouTube videos. We think this last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">feature adding a YouTube video is going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">be particularly useful for extensions, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">it's often hard to explain exactly what an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">extension does without showing it in action. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="237">And you can do this right on your detail page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="237">Another thing I'd like you to notice on this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">gallery page on this detail page is a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">section here in the corner on the blue background. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="248">We all notice here is that they have a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">nice colorful logo. And they have a short </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">description that very clearly states what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">their extension is going to do and doesn't, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">and actually avoids any kind of marketing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">speak. Now, the reason this is so important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">is that this information is what shows up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">in search results and as you browse through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">the gallery. And so, this is really what the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="269">user bases their decision to click in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">extension on. And by keeping this as clear </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">as possible, that leads you standout among, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">you know, a field of extensions. The last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">part of promoting your &mdash; of making your extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">successful is to promote it. Now, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">as a Chrome Extensions Team, we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">do our very best to promote all the great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">extensions you write. So, we have featured </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">extensions, we have top picks, we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">to do a video in blog post, and many more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">things. But we also encourage all developers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">such as yourselves to go out and promote the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">extensions to the channels that you have available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">to you. One example of that that I think is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">great is promoting your Chrome Extension to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">users of Chrome that visit your Website. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">with that that does is gives you a starting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">user base unless you start rising in our rankings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">and then that in turn makes us even more likely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">to want to showcase you. So we think if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">do these three things: build a great extension, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">really polish its appearance in the gallery, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">and then start promoting in, then you'll have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">a really good chance of having success, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">we think that's a really great opportunity. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="337">So, let me also speak for you that today will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">not the first day of extensions we've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">working publicly for a while. It's the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">day that we're out in the open for our beta </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">users, but it's by no means the last day for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">extensions. We've got a lot of exciting things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">going forward. First obvious one is Mac support. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="361">In fact, extensions already work on the latest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">Chromium build. So the latest open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">builds of extensions of Mac have extensions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="366">And we expect that later this week, we will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">ship a dev build with extensions enabled on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">Mac, and then extensions will come to Mac </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">beta and it's stable in early 2010. The second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">part is internationalization. Chrome is already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">available in more than 40 languages. And we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">have a lot of users internationally. And we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">want to make it just as easy for extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">developers to reach our international users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">as it is for us. We hope that a lot of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">will take advantage of this functionality, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">which again will be coming in Q1. Finally, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">we're going to be adding lots of APIs. I expect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">that for every subsequent major release of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">Chrome, we will have a new set of APIs for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">you to play with. Now, we have some ideas. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="415">We want to add more UI surfaces. We want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">add, say, keyboard shortcuts, maybe some way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">to interact with network request. But at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">end of the day, we're looking for your feedback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">to tell us what you want and what's missing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">to create your next great idea. And as we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">open source, just join us on the mailing list, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">submit any idea, submit a proposal, or even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">come help us implement it. So to finish, we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">been out now one day. When we first launched </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">we had about 300 extensions. The last I checked, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">I think we're up to 480. We're hoping we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">have 500 by the end of today. Actually, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">must be at 481 by now at least. And so, we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">been really happy with the reception we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">seen so far. As Brian mentioned at the beginning, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">we find extensions incredibly important to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">the future of Google Chrome and we're hoping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">that if you are a user, you'll go out and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">try one of the many extensions we have available. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="473">And if you are a developer, you come up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">your next awesome idea and build it for Chrome. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="478">Thank you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="478">One last thing, now, of course, you're welcome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">to grab something to drink and eat. We've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">also set up a few conference rooms around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">this area where the demolers [PH], so Xmarks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">and eBay and Google Translate will be around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">to showcase their extension and chat with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">you guys. So, feel free to go find them. Also, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">all the extensions team members are here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="504">We're wearing these shirts. Come find us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="509">We're really excited to talk to you all. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="509">[END] </span></p></div>
