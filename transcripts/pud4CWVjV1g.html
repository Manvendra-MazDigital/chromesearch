<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="6"><span class="speakerName">Eve Andersson</span>: Today we're going to talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="6">a free online course we've developed called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="11">"Introduction to Web Accessibility." We will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="11">learn about some of the tools and techniques </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">in this course for making websites more accessible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">to people with vision impairments. My name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">is Eve Andersson. I'm a manager in accessibility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">engineering here at Google. And we have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">distinguished panel to my left of accessibility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">experts. On my far left is Vint Cerf. He is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">a VP at Google and our Chief Internet Evangelist. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="41">Some have also referred to him as "one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">the Fathers of the Internet." We also have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">Charles Chen, an engineer in accessibility, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">and he's one of the developers of this course. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="55">We have one more panelist who wasn't able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">to be with us today. His name is T.V. Raman. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="61">He is a research scientist at Google, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">he works on accessibility. He also helped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">develop this course, and we'll see him later </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">in a video. All right, the first question </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">is for you, Vint. Vint, why should people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">- why should software developers learn about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">accessibility? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="83"><span class="speakerName">Vint</span>: Well, let's start with a very fundamental </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">point: not all of the websites in the world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">are readily accessible to people who need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">some assistance. If you happen to be blind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">or have vision impairment, you can't see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">web pages, and you can't interact with them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">in the way others can. If you happen to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">deaf, or in my case, I'm hearing impaired, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">there are times when you can't actually quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">make out the audio, and it would help a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">if we could see captions or written material </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">to go along with it. There are other people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">who have a variety of other problems that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">have to be accommodated. And so this whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">notion is about assistance to make things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">useful and accessible for everyone. The reason </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">that it's important to do that is twofold. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="124">First it's the right thing to do. We want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">everyone to take advantage of and be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">to use the benefits and fruitful content available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="137">on the internet. But perhaps more important, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="137">it's ironic that the one tool that's been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">invented in the last several years - the computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">- is the one thing that can, in fact, make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">things accessible because it's so flexible. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="150">We can write programs to adapt and accommodate. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="156">And yet that's the one area that has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">poorly treated for many, many years. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">almost as strange as the telephone invented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">by Alexander Graham Bell intending to help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">the deaf and being useless to them until somebody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">finally invented things like email and teletypes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">and so on. So we have an obligation to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">this new technology and make it work for everyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">on the planet regardless of the needs that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">they may have for assistance. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="184"><span class="speakerName">Eve</span>: Thank you, Vint. So one of the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">you said was that we want the web to work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">for everyone, and it currently doesn't. Charles, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">could you show us what the web looks like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">to someone who's blind? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="198"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Sure, Eve. So if we switch to my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">screen here, I have a very simple example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">running. And what you'll see is that &mdash; I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">going to go over it twice. The first time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">I'm going to show you what it looks like visually. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">And then I'll show you what someone with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">visual impairment would experience the site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">as. So as you can see, I have this page up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">here. It looks like a simple enough page. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">It has a title, "Button and Alert." There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">a button, and if I click it, I'll get an alert. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">So I'm just going to click it with the mouse, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">click it. "The button has been pressed!" No </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">problems. But now let's see what a user with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">a visual impairment would experience. So I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">going to turn on my screen reader here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="240"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: ChromeVox is ready. Button and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="247">Alert Example tab. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="247"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: All right, so now my screen reader </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">is enabled. Let me navigate through this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">and let's experience what I hear. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="258"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: Click the button below to generate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">an alert. Smile image. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="263"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Smile image. OK, that was interesting. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="263"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: If this were a real page, we would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">have more content here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="268"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Wait. Where was the button? OK, maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">it was the smile image. Let's try that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="271"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: Smile image. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="274"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: OK, I'm going to try and press Enter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">to click it. Hm. OK, nothing's happening. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">Well, I'm a really good screen reader user, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">so I know that I can try to generate some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">sort of fake click event. Let me try and force </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">click this. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="288"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: Clicked. Smile image. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="288"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: It says I clicked it, but I'm not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">hearing anything. As you can see, this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">a pretty broken experience, and it's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">difficult to use if you have a visual impairment, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">even for something as simple as this page. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="305"><span class="speakerName">Eve</span>: Thanks for that. As I said earlier, TV </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">Raman can't be with us here today. But we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">spent some time with him yesterday, and we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">see a video where he talks a little bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">about the content of the course, about accessible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">development, as well as how we came up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">doing this course. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="324"><span class="speakerName">TV Raman</span>: When you put up a website or you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">write a web page, you actually don't know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">who your audience is. Your audience could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">be in the United States. Your audience could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">be worldwide. Your audience might be English </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">speaking. Your audience might be speaking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">another language as their first language. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="341">So it's all about reach. And if it's all about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">reach, then optimizing your content to cater </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">to the widest variety of needs is something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">in everybody's interest. We thought wouldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">it be nice to try using this new medium of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">online education to teach something that deeply </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">affects the online experience. So, can we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">use this online medium of web courses and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">web-based education to teach web developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">how to make their websites and web contents </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">maximally useful and usable to all of their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">audience? So during this class, we will both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">teach you how to enhance your content for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">accessibility and then also teach you to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">tools that check whether you have done the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">needed work to make your content accessible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">and also give you an opportunity to use tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">that let you experience firsthand what your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">site feels like to someone who cannot see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">and is trying to listen to your site. So in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">a nutshell, we'll teach you techniques for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">enhancing your content. We will show you tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">that let you first check your content, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">you'll get warnings and tips on ways we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">fix it. And then you'll fix it and actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">be able to experience a before-and-after. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="429">We want to keep things simple for this first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">course. And so we are going to narrow down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">and focus on things you can do when you create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">your content to make it work well for users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">who are blind or users who have low vision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="441">That isn't to say that those are the only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">problems you need to worry about. But this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">will get you a part of the way to starting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">to think about accessibility and about all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">your users. So when you think about accessibility, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">don't think of it as something special for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">a few users. Think of it as designing your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="464">content and site so that it works for everyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="464">independent of their needs who might happen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">to come to your site. Accessibility is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">about you reaching the maximum number of devices, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">the maximum number of users, the maximum number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">of needs and abilities. Our goal is to whet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">your appetite and get you interested. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">at the end of the course, we will point you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">at additional resources that will let you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">deep dive into specific areas. So enjoy the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">course, and I hope to see you at the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="495">end of this course, where you are making your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">sites address a lot more of the accessibility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">issues that arise. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="505"><span class="speakerName">Eve</span>: So in the video, Raman gave us a brief </span><span class="line" data-startTime="505">overview of the content of the course. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">he mentioned that there are tools that let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">you as a web developer experience a website </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">as a blind person does, as well as to help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">you make a site more accessible. Can you show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">us a little bit more about these tools? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="526"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Sure, Eve. So the two tools that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">we'll be using primarily in this course are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">Accessibility Developer Tools and ChromeVox. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="537">Both of these are extensions that are freely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">available on the Chrome Web Store, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">can go ahead and download them. As you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">see on my screen, I have these tools installed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="547">So let's start with Accessibility Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">Tools. These tools are some really simple, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">really quick audits that will tell you if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">you have problems with your web page. Now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">let's try running this audit on an example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">and let's see what it tells us. So I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">to go to Tools - I'm going to bring up Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">Tools. And now if I switch into my Audits </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">panel, I can select Accessibility and I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">ask it to run the audit. So I'm going to run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">the audit, and you see right here I get a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">warning. The warning tells me that images </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">should have an alt attribute. Let's go ahead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="582">and try to fix this. Ah, smile.png. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">why it was saying 'smile image' rather than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">the actual text of the button. So let's try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">and fix this. Let me switch over to my text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">editor here. Okay, so here is where I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">the image. I'm going to go ahead and add alt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">text that make sense: alt="I'm a button. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="616">Click me! smiley face" Okay, so let's save </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">this, and let's go back to the page, and let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">see what the audit says this time. Okay, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="626">you can see, I no longer have that warning. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="637">So that's good. That's definitely an improvement. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="637">And now let's move on to the next tool, ChromeVox. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="643">So ChromeVox is our screen reader for Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">OS. It's also available as a Chrome extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">that anyone can install and try out. As a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">web developer, this tool is really nice because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">it gives you a way to experience what a blind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">user would experience directly in your browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">without any real additional setup aside from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">just installing the extension and enabling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">it. So I'm going to go ahead and enable the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">extension now. And let's try running through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="667">this page again and let's see what it sounds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="667">like. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="671"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: ChromeVox is ready. Button and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">Alert Example tab. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="678"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: OK, so let's go ahead and read through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">this page now. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="681"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: Click the button below to generate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">an alert. I'm a button. Click me! Smiley face. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="687"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: OK, so that's nice. It told me what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="687">this button has, but let's see. CHROMEVOX: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">If this were a real page, we would have more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">content here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="697"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: OK, well, from the text of that image, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="697">I got the impression that it's a button. But </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">it still didn't tell me that it was actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">a button from a screen reader's perspective. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">Also, if I move over it, I think I still won't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">be able to click it. Let's see. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="712"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: I'm a button. Click me. Smiley </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">face. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="715"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Yeah, OK, so I still can't activate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">it. So I think we still need a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="720">of work here, so let's go ahead and fix this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="720">Now, the nice thing is, even though this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">a pretty broken experience that we're starting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">with, it's relatively easy to fix and correct, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">as I will proceed to demonstrate. So let me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">switch back to the code. And now one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">first things to fix is to make sure that this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">is actually reported to screen readers as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">a button. So I'm going to add an ARIA role: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">role="button" that makes sense. And let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">also make this button focusable and respond </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">to the Enter key. So I'm going to put: tabindex="0" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">and I'm going to add a keydown handler. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">of course, I need to write the function for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">a keydown handler, which is really quick. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="778">All right, so this should do the trick. Let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="809">reload and let's see what this is like. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="809"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: Window Button and Alert. Example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="814">Button and Alert Example. I'm a button. Click </span><span class="line" data-startTime="814">me! Smiley face. Button. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="821"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: OK, so as you can see now, this time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">it actually reported that it was a button. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">And let's try clicking it. OK, this was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">little bit better. It responded to the Enter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">key. But still, as a blind user, I wouldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">have heard the message that came up. So let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="839">go ahead and let's fix that. So all I need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="839">to do here is, because it's an alert, I just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">give need to give it an ARIA role of alert: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">role="alert" And let's try this again. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="855"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: Window Button and Alert. Example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="855">Tab. Button and &mdash; Button and Alert. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="860"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: OK, so I'm going to try this again. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="860"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: Click the button below to generate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">an alert. I'm a button, Click me! Smiley face. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">Button. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="868"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: And now I'm going to press Enter. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="868"><span class="speakerName">Chromevox</span>: The button has been pressed. Alert. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="872"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Yay! So now this all works. So as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">you can see with just a little bit of code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="878">I was able to take a completely broken experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="878">and make it work reasonably well. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="882"><span class="speakerName">Eve</span>: Thanks for that demo, Charles. So I saw </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">in that, that you were editing HTML and JavaScript. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="889"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="889"><span class="speakerName">Eve</span>: What do people need to know before they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">can embark on this course? Who is this course </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">for? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="895"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Glad you asked that. So this course </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">is for web developers. You do need to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">some basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">and CSS. But really it's for all levels of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">web developers. You don't necessarily have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">to be a JavaScript ninja to do well in this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">course. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="909"><span class="speakerName">Vint</span>: Well, that looked pretty simple, actually. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="912"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Yeah, so I think what was helpful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="912">here was that the starting design was actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">fairly simple, fairly straightforward. There </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">was nothing in the design itself that made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">it inherently inaccessible. You have a button. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">You click on it. You get a reaction. As such, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">if the missing piece for accessibility is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">at a technical level, where things aren't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">labeled, or you don't have the right ARIA </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">properties, or you don't have the right keyboard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">handlers, then it is really simple to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">these problems and address them. And you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">fix them in a short amount of time. And these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">are also the type of solutions that we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">be covering in the course. The course is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">great starting point to help you learn about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">these fixes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="948"><span class="speakerName">Vint</span>: So I would take away from this example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">Charles, two things. First of all, the tool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="952">that helped you discover that there was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">problem could be very helpful if you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">a significant amount of code - having something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">staring over your shoulder and saying, "Don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">forget, you need to do something about that," </span><span class="line" data-startTime="965">I think is very helpful. And you demonstrated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="965">that for at least some of the problems that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">are identified, the fix is not all that hard. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="970">I think that on a deeper level, though, understanding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">how to create designs that can be made accessible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">is a much tougher proposition. You really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">have to put your head somehow in the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">place as someone who's using this with need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">for assistance. And so although this course </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">is at the beginning, so to speak, at some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">point I hope we can help people understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">what it means to do really good accessible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">engineering. And that, of course, is the ultimate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="999">objective to all of what we're trying to accomplish. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1003"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Absolutely, Vint. At a deeper level, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">design matters, right? So having a good accessible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">design or at least a design that can be made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">accessible is key. We can do all the technical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">fixes we want to, but that's not going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">compensate for a really bad design if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1019">start with that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1019"><span class="speakerName">Vint</span>: Exactly right. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1021"><span class="speakerName">Eve</span>: So how can people do accessible design? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1021"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: I think it's about thinking through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1027">your entire workflow and making it so that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1027">there are multiple ways of approaching it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">and multiple ways of getting through it. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">for example, you don't really want to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">a program that says you must use a mouse to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">drive it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1040"><span class="speakerName">Eve</span>: Mmhmm </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1040"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Instead, think of the task, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">Something as simple as, say, a drag-and-drop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">operation. If you made it so that the only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">way to add something was via drag and drop, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">then you have a serious accessibility problem. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1053">Because for a user with physical impairments </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">who can't use a mouse, or for a blind user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">who wouldn't be able to use a mouse and aim </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">it properly, it will not work for that audience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1063">However, if you expanded &mdash; if you took a step </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">back and thought about the problem you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">trying to solve, which is to get the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">intent of: they take something from bucket </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1072">A and they're moving it into bucket B; if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1072">you then think of the problem in that sense, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">then you have a lot of options open. Because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">then it doesn't necessarily have to be drag-and-drop. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1082">Drag-and-drop is one of the ways of moving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1082">something from A into B, but you could also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">do it by keyboard by selecting it first and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">then doing a cut-and-paste operation. So really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">it's about thinking through the problem that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">you're trying to solve and then thinking through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1095">multiple ways of letting the user indicate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1095">what they wish to do and conveying the results </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1100">back to the user and not forcing them into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1100">just one mode of doing things. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1104"><span class="speakerName">Vint</span>: Do you suppose now that we're beginning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1104">to see computers getting better and better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1109">and actually understanding speech, that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1109">will get into a more conversational interaction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1116">with some of these applications so we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1116">actually tell it what it is we're trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">accomplish and have it figure out the best </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">way to do that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1123"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: I certainly hope so. That's one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">the things that I think is really cool about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">technologies like Google Now and some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">things that we've shown off at Google I/O. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">The nice thing, too, is I think we really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">want to think a step ahead of just the computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1138">doing exactly what the user said, but rather </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1138">having some level of anticipation and assistance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">so that the user doesn't necessarily have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">to mechanically go through every individual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1148">step, but rather have a smoother workflow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1148">where they can perform a task and have efficient </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1155">task completions. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1155"><span class="speakerName">Eve</span>: From what you describe, Charles, it sounds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">like doing things that help people with accessibility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1158">needs has the potential to help everybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1163">streamline what they're doing on the computer. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1163"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Bingo. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1166"><span class="speakerName">Vint</span>: That's a really good point. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1166"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: And that's really something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1168">I think everyone should strive for. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1168"><span class="speakerName">Eve</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1171"><span class="speakerName">Charles</span>: Thanks, Eve. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1171"><span class="speakerName">Eve</span>: So jumping up one level, I want to come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1175">back to something, Vint, that you touched </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1175">on earlier. You mentioned, in other words, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1183">that the internet is supposed to level the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1183">playing field for everyone. Can you comment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">a little bit more on that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1189"><span class="speakerName">Vint</span>: Well, I think as Charles has just demonstrated, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">the internet is filled with boulders and mountains </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">that have to be either climbed or moved in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1201">order to make it - moved, preferably - to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1201">make it a really level playing field. What </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">I found most interesting about Charles' demonstration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">is the level of detail with which you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">to think in order to imagine what your software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">is going to be like for someone who's blind. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1219">You have to similarly try to think your way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1219">through what happens if you have a user who's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">deaf or has some other impairment. What I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">think is fundamental here - and the reason </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">it's important for this class to be taken </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">by everyone who's interested in making web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">experiences useful for everyone - is the degree </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">to which you have to imagine how this is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1243">to behave for someone who needs assistance. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1243">This is all about harnessing the computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">power that we know is in those boxes to help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">someone who needs a little bit of assistance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">to experience the web in a way that is needed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">for that particular person. The thing I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">to emphasize here is the diversity of assistance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">needs. It's not a simple thing to say, "I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1269">will do it this way for anyone who has a vision </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1269">impairment, and I'll do it this way for someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1274">who has an audio problem." In fact, every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1274">single person with one of these variable challenges </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1283">may need different nuances - different kinds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1283">of assistance. And so we need a lot of flexibility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">built into this environment. It's also, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">think, very important not to imagine that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1293">you can build a web application and then somehow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1293">sprinkle accessibility pixie dust on it and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">have it work. It's much more fundamental than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">that, and that's why this class is so important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1304">So I want to encourage everyone who has a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1304">desire to make their web pages and their other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1312">applications accessible to everyone, to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1312">this class, absorb what you learn from it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">and then apply it. Because that will, in fact, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1319">make the internet be for everyone. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1327"><span class="speakerName">Eve</span>: Thank you for watching. This is the end </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1327">of our GDL on our new course, Introduction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">to Web Accessibility. To close us out, Vint, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">what should people watching this GDL do next? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1339"><span class="speakerName">Vint</span>: That's easy. Sign up for the class, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">take it, absorb it, and apply it! </span></p>
