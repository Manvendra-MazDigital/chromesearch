<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/XMYVSIUfu2I">youtu.be/XMYVSIUfu2I</a><div id="transcript"><p><span class="line" data-startTime="0"> TORI: I am Andraz Tori, Co-Founder and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">CTO at Zemanta. I've been coding since I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">10 but always did other stuff too including </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">being a TV host on National Television in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">Slovenia. Naturally, the show was about consumer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">electronics. Zemanta is a Slovenian company </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">trying to change how text is being written </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">on the web, worldwide. We want to make text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">editor smart, making them understand what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">people are writing so that editors can help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">us with additional images, links, text, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">maybe someday even fact checking. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="41"> What is your extension about? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41"> TORI: Our extension makes text editors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">of all major blogging platforms better and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">more interesting. When the extension sees </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">that you're trying to write a blog post, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">extends the editor with additional functionality, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">suggesting images, related articles, links, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">and text you can include in your post. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="62"> What are the challenges and benefits of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">embedding your UI on another site? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67"> TORI: It's really hard to maintain an extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">that integrates with UIs of various blogging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">tools keeping compatibility with over 10 rich </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">text editors. In exchange for that effort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">on our site, the user gets seamless integration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">without needing to invoke any special comment, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">site, or menu. Zemanta just works and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">how software should be. Chrome makes life </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">for this kind of extensions easier since the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">extension API is built on the paradigm that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">extensions want to modify web pages and not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">just sit on the side. Generally, we'd like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">to see more web standards that would make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">extensions like ours easier. For example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">a standard way to extend a rich text editor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">on the web would be nice. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="116"> What got you interested in Google Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">extensions? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119"> TORI: Our existing base of users was migrating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">to Chrome. So we naturally had to follow them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="126">Our first Chrome extension was developed as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">an internal company hack day project, in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">single day. The first time we tried developing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">an extension was in September '09. The documentation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">was very sparse. We were wondering in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">dark, but the open source nature of Chrome, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">allowed us to create a functioning prototype. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="146">The second time around, it was one day before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">the general availability of extensions in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">the beta channel. Luckily, with development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">based in Slovenia and due to the time zone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">difference, we were able to get from prototype </span><span class="line" data-startTime="164">to final extension while people here in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="164">U.S. were sleeping and we had it ready by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">morning U.S. time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="169"> How did your vision evolve as you were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">working on your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173"> TORI: We had to make a few compromises </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">to our extension because of our specific needs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="177">A couple of things come to mind. We could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">expose only one function from extension to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">the widget. We preferred to be able to expose </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">many of them so we had to reengineer the approach. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="189">We used window.name hack for making cross-domain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">POST calls. We'd prefer using something non-hackish. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="198">Also based on our users' feedback, we changed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">the browser action menu to page action with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">our second release. Toolbar space is precious, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">and your extension really has to be used all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">the time to earn a permanent space there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="217"> What did you enjoy the most about writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221"> TORI: The thing we enjoyed the most was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">that the extension is very much like creating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">a webpage and the compactness of the API is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">also great. You can include any JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">library you need and don't need to reinvent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">the wheel. The web-like environment also makes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">it easy to include more people in development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">without having them to all learn a new environment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">immediately, even though, it's easy. Also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">restarting a browser is a web version of compiling. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="251">Not being forced to do so speeds up development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">immensely. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="255"> What were some challenges you faced when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">writing your extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259"> TORI: Our biggest problem was and still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">is that our homepage widget needs to communicate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">with our extension. But for security reasons, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">there is no support for that from the extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">framework. We found a hack that works for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="272">now, but we're still looking for a better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">way to solve this. Chrome is being developed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">for many different operating systems but not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">with the same speed. So in the early days, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">it could happen that features described in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">the documentation didn't work everywhere or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">at least not as described. This stopped being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="294">a problem after we realized this and started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="294">to expect it. Lately, we don't see it anymore. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="300"> Was there a particular technical challenge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">you faced in which you gave an innovative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">solution? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305"> TORI: We are proud of what we did but at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">the same time we are building on knowledge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">freely shared within the web community. Hence, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">it feels odd to take credits for it. For example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">our widget needs two things, an API key from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">our extension and the ability to communicate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">with our servers. We achieved the first by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">using a hack by Aaron Boodman and the second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">by piggybacking on window.name as first described </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">by Chris Zipp. We still had to write a bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">of our code and I think we did a good job. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="339">But glorious contribution wasn't really ours. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="339"> What do you think about Google Chrome's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">decision to use CSS, HTML and JavaScript as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">the basis of its extension framework? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351"> TORI: Using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">a variety of extensions lowers the barrier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">to entry significantly. Existing skills can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">be used and even some code can be shared between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">browsers. There is no need to hire external </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">specialized developers since companies can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">use a lot of internal expertise in standard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">web technologies. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="371"> What advice can you give someone before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">starting to work on a Google Chrome extension? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377"> TORI: To start working on a Chrome extension, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">read the documentation first. Not scan it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="382">Really read it since it's really concise. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="382">It's highly likely that your answer is already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">there. You will waste a lot of time, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">we did, if you don't follow this simple advice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="394"> Were you able to share code with the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">browser extensions you released? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399"> TORI: We tried to share as much code as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">possible between Chrome, Firefox, and Internet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">Explorer extensions. And even with server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">site platforms like WordPress, Joomla, Movable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">Type, and Drupal. Over the years, we noticed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">that browsers are becoming more and more compatible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">with each other. Unfortunately, we are still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">far from having full cross-browser extensions. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="423">But one can dream. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="423"> Come meet the Zemanta team at the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="428">IO conference. </span></p></div>
