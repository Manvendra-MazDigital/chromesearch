<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/Mk-tFn2Ix6g">youtu.be/Mk-tFn2Ix6g</a><div id="transcript"><p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="7"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Cool. All right, guys. My name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">is Paul Irish and I am a developer advocate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">on the Chrome team. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="14">I want to talk a little bit about tooling. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="17">So this is about building Web apps, finding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">the right software to make your process of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">building Web apps fun, awesome, enjoyable, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">less stressful, more productive, things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="28">that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="28">Now, I'm going to talk a little bit about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">kind of how we're building Web apps today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">and how I think we can build them in the future, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">but for a second I want to take a few steps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">back and walk back a few years, back to 2006 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">because this is the year that I wrote like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">my first website where I was like doing all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">the right things when it came to Web standards. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="47">And I felt so good about the way that I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">doing it, so I was actually here and I did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">something probably like this, and I was doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">a little bit of this and then this and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">that and then that and that, da, da... </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="64">This is typical, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">[Laughter] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="66"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Oh, there we go. Nice! Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="73"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: All right. I'm really glad we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">don't have to type that out anymore. That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">really nice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="79">But this is like &mdash; so what I actually did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">is when I made this site, and it turned out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">to be really nice, I did the whole thing in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">Notepad. And I think we consider it a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">funny now that I would write like pretty significant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">site in Notepad, but at the time I was like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">"I'm a craftsman over my markup and I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">be one with it, and the closest I can be in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">it is in Notepad exe." So I just used that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="115">And it just seems kind of silly. I thought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">I was so close to it, but really it's not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">really craftsmanship. That was handcraft. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="122">That was like the Web's development equivalent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">to whittling a stick. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="127">And handcraft is more about choosing tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">well, finding the right tools to get the job </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">done and assist you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="139">And I noticed this too, I started at Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">about two years ago, and looking around when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">you're surrounded by really smart people, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">and you notice what the really productive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">developers do. And they know their &mdash; they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">have tools that they use, they know them really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">well, and they embrace them. And so I kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">of like noticed that there was a theme going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">on here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="161">And so I want to talk a little bit about tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="165">And this is not about, you know, Google development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">tools. This is about &mdash; you know, you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">have to be building the next Gmail for this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">kind stuff to apply to you. It's for everyone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="176">A lot of people have been noticing this recently. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="176">And I just want you to, like, think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">remember there was a point at which you didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">actually use version control. You might have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">been on a team and you're like, Hey, I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="186">to be editing, indexing HTML. Can you hold </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">on just a second? Okay, you can do it now. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="190">Like source safe. It was, like, annoying, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">but version control made it a lot better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="197">And we can focus on development, not tiresome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">debugging when you don't want to be doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="208">And then how much time have you lost when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">you actually had a colon where you were supposed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">to have a semi colon or an extra comma at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">the end of your little object in JavaScript, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">and you were like ah! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">There's lots of funny things. I'm not going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">to click to it. It's a little not safe to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="223">work, commit logs from last night, pulling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">in logs from GitHub where people happen to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">use expletives because they're a bit frustrated. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="235">People that are making silly mistakes that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">they probably don't need to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="240">So we're seeing a little bit of shift towards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">looking at tools assisting us. And Rebecca </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">Murphy did a great post about this sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">shift recently, and she said we're seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">us focus from valuing trivia to valuing tools. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="250">And a similar thing was said a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">ago by Michael Lop, known by Rams online. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="256">He's an engineering manager at Apple. He said, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">There's a short list of tools that you must </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">be rabid about, rabid, foaming at the mouth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">crazy. And he went on to talk about how he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">used his editor, his terminal and what made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">him productive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="273">And I think this is important to really identify </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">what you feel great about. And so I've done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="278">a little bit of research and it talks about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">this, and there's a lot of tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="284">When I say tools, it like covers a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">things. So this is a quick way of trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">visualize from start to end what are all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">tools that I use from the birth of a project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">to deploying it out to the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="297">And we're going to kind of walk through a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="297">little bit of this, but focusing on your developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">workflow. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="302">So I'll just &mdash; we're going to walk through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">the current workflow for Web app developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="306">And really the way we'll start this off is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">in your shell. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="311">In your shell &mdash; I'll bring mine up right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="315">Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="319">The first thing is I think you should make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">it sexy. Feel good about this terminal that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">you're typing into. There's a really great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">community on GitHub around dot files, configuration </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">files for your bash prompt or your ZHS prompt, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">other application configurations. So I encourage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">you to go check that out, see what other people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">are doing and customize your shell and share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">your customizations with other people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="342">There's a few favorites that I have. One of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">them is a directory jumper called Z. I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">show that now. I can jump to any folder that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">I've been in somewhat recently. I'll jump </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">over to the modernizer project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="359">You can type any portion of that word, hit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">Z. We jump right into that. Now we'll actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">go over to the HTML Please project. Just type </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">in "Z please," and we jump over into that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">folder, nice and easy. Cool. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="371">Now, moving on past my shell &mdash; actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">first, the server alias. This is pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="378">This alias, this is just a bit of bash. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">are just firing up a simple Web server, no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">big deal. At the same time we're opening up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">browser tab. Configurable port if we want, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">but we'll default to 8,000 if we want. I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">do that now, type in server. Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="406">And refresh. Yeah, cool, awesome, good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="408">So we have my local HTML5 Please running right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="412">Now, coming back, the next part is the editor. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="412">And the editor, you might have your own preferences. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="423">That's fine, but the key to a good editor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="423">is that it's an onion application, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">to say that there's a nice learning curve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">where you can kind of peel back the layers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">of functionality and kind of grow from novice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">to expert at a very easy pace. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="440">So the other thing with an editor is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">more than any other tool, this is where your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">investment in time and learning it well and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">learning the features inside of it will pay </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">off huge dividends. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="450">So I'll bring up mine right now. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="455">Let's see. I'm actually using Sublime text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">and we'll bring this up and move it over here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">and we're going to bring up actually my script </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">for this file. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="471">Nice. Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="471">Now, one of the things that I've noticed developing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">recently is that I've kind of, like, learned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">new tricks, I like some of the features in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">this editor. And one of the things that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">added to my editor workflow recently was having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">linting. And code linting built-in write live. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="488">So I'll show you what I mean right now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="497">So here I have these three variable declarations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="497">It's cool. I didn't actually write these three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">lines, but maybe I'll refactor them a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">bit. Select them. I will align &mdash; that's nice. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="511">Good thing. I'll do a multiline select. Move </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">that over. That's cool. And then I'll go over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">and fix that. And good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="519">Now, one of the things that it's helping me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">out with here is I have this white box right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">here and this is linter plug-in that's running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">inside Sublime and it's telling me I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">a problem. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="535">Now, way down at the bottom it says "H2 is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">not defined." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">And I'm like, but you're right here. Hmm. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="541">And what is the problem in this right here? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">Yes, my semi colon should be a comma and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">should be stringing my variable declarations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="556">That's so nice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="556">Yes. It's cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="560">All right. So yeah, I got lifing back and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">it was able to, like, save me from an implied </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">global variable, which we don't want. I probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">would have caught that. It would have been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">a syntax error when I refresh the page, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">I'm getting it caught right here immediately. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="574">So I like this. In fact, I think code linting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">is your first unit test. Typically the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">unit test that you might write is the global </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">there, does this thing exist. And even before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">that you get feedback on if it's available. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="587">And in JavaScript this is particularly important. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="592">Some of the languages have rich static analysis </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">features. JavaScript is a little hairy in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">that sort of thing, but we have code linting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="599">I'm using JS right here, and I can get immediate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">feedback on is my code syntactically sound </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">and is there anything that I should watch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">out for, like what we just saw? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">So one of the parts of this is I really like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">getting the realtime feedback. If you've seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">the talk by Brett Victor, Invented on Principle, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">one of the things that he talks about is having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">immediate feedback between your code and your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">results and getting that feedback. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="628">And so I'm going to show a little bit of kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">of what kind of tools provide this sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">workflow these days. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="637">So I'll move this back over here and I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">open up the style folder or the style sheet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">that we have. I think it's style.scss. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="645">So we're using Sass and Compass, and I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="654">to jump down to H1. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="654">So what I'm going to do is just make an edit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">in the text shadow and we'll just change this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">part of the text shadow from this right here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="667">up to 41 pixels and save it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="667">Now, nothing happens. I refresh the page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="673">Okay, cool. That's good. But I can turn on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">this library load extension, which is just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">available inside Chrome. It communicates with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">the system application back here. And now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="685">any changes that I make are in fact live. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="685">So I make a change, I just hit save. I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">have to go over and hit refresh. That's good. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="690">So I'll actually just say that that sounds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="697">pretty good. And I will go down here and add </span><span class="line" data-startTime="697">a little bit more functionality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="702">Let's see, I'll do a CSS transition that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">want to see .4 seconds. I'll apply that to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">all things. And then add a hover state to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">it. I think this time we'll do a transform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="723">Nice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="723">Okay. So I just hit saved, I come over here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">with my mouse and &mdash; nice. This is definitely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">an improvement and I will be committing this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">to the repo right now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="736">[Laughter] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="739"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Or not. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="739">But that's cool. But I'm getting my immediate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">feedback, so I'm getting my Sass immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">recompiled on the fly and then my CSS is being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">served back to the browser. Without even the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">browser refreshing I can change the page, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">my scroll position is maintained and just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">the style sheet is being swapped in, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">is really nice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="763">All right. So I'm going to show a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">of the browser dev tools inside Chrome, some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">features that help especially with building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">applications that you may not be aware of. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="773">The first is sourceURL. And this is a feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="779">that's been in the browser for quite awhile. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="779">This is a little demo set up by Ryan Sutton, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">and so we have a little bit of Coffescript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">right here in the middle. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="792">I'm going to make a small little edit to this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="792">Coffescript first. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="798">Nice. Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="798">I'll bring up the Chrome dev tools. And &mdash; that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">pretty good. Nice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="804">Now, normally I can take this Coffescript, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">I can run it through Coffescript.js, compile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">it into its JavaScript form, and if I run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">it, it goes through eval. And normally when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">you take text and run it through eval, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">evaluates, but it just kind of disappears </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">into thin air. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="825">SourceURL is a way to basically treat that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">as a file. So if you see down at the bottom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">I'm adding googleio.js and adding to compile. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="831">Now you see it over here in the Chrome dev </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">tools. And if you look over here we have what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">I just added in the Coffescript, now compiled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">to JavaScript, and at the side over here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">the sourceURL. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="849">So this little line is indicating, hey, dev </span><span class="line" data-startTime="849">tools. I got this text, I threw it into eval, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">but can you treat it as a file? Thanks very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">much, that would be great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="860">So this is really nice, too. So not only is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">it a file, but I get all the features that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">I would expect. So let's say break points. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="866">First I'll just make sure that my cube function </span><span class="line" data-startTime="873">is working all nicely. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="873">Yes, good. Cube files 125. At a break point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">cube of five we break. I can't actually check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">the value of X right now. We're looking good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="887">Yes, sure, we'll continue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="887">Or I can do a live edit. I can immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">change this file on the fly, we'll return </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">2 from square so now let me ask for a cube </span><span class="line" data-startTime="900">and it should be 5 times 2. Cool. And we get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="900">our result, which is 10. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="907">So I'm getting live edit and break points </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">on some JavaScript which was compiled down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">from Coffescript all on the fly. I'm showing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">up as real files. That's pretty nice. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="920">Ember actually uses sourceURL to great effect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="920">to &mdash; Ember the JavaScript library, to emulate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">modules, which is really, really cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="927">Another feature I want to show real quick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">is source maps. So if I bring back open my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">local HTML5 Please and view the source, down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="941">at the bottom is my original sources for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="941">project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="947">Looks like we had some script tags pulling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="947">in a few libraries and then this script.js </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">that I did before, but what really gets served </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">to the browser is script.min.js, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">minified. My Chrome extension is critifying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">this for me, but I really want you to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="969">that it's minified. Okay, cool. Thank you, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="969">Chrome extension. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="973">All right. So the browser is actually receiving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="973">the minified source, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="979">But down at the very bottom of it is a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="979">indication similar to what we saw with sourceURL, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="985">only this time it's source mapping URL. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="985">And this points over to a map file. And this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="991">map file does &mdash; basically takes the identifiers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="991">in this compiled source and maps it back to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">my original sources and says these are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">files. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="999">And so what I can get are the results. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="999">I open up my dev tools and instead of seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">script.min.js I see my original sources all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">in here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1010">And the cool thing is that the same thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1010">works over here. Here's my nice edits that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">I made. I can apply break points and click </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">on any &mdash; and now we're actually broken in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">my original source even though the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">is interpreting the minified version. So this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1029">is great for an environment like production </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1029">where you're serving up the compiled sources, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">but you want to be able to debug the original </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1033">things you typed up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1038">All right. Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1038">Lastly, if you noticed, this might look a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">little different to you. First of all, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">dev tools are on the right-hand side. If you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">open up the settings panel which is down here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">in the bottom right, we have a few things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">in there. So doc to right, which moves it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">over there. Really like it in doc to right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">mode. We have our step to bugging on the right-hand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">side and I can get that out of the way. My </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">file's over here and I can get that out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">the way and view my scripts in their full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">glory. I can also jump to different scripts. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">Instead of using this menu I can kind of hit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">Command O and see all those scripts that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">available. It's kind of get completion there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1086">Or Command Shift O and see all the functions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1086">that are defined in this file, and now I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1092">just bind &mdash; yes, the sort function is what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1092">I'm looking for. I can jump immediately to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1097">that definition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1097">So a lot of nice things to make dealing with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">a large JavaScript code base a bit easier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">instead of the dev tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1105">All right. Now, I wonder about testing for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">a moment. And this right here is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">a picture from a series that we have up in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">the bathrooms at the Googleplex in Mountain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">View, California. The series is called Testing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">on the Toilet. So each week there's a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">sheet that gives you some good tips for writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">test against your software. Good reading material, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1133">But it's important to write unit tests, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1136">I have a few ideas here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1136">First is that you should author your test </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">in whatever you feel most comfortable in, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">so these days for JavaScript it would probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">be Jasmine Q unit or mocha. They all have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">kind of different assertion styles, and find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1154">whichever you like and you feel comfortable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1154">writing those assertions in. Build up a large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">test suite and then it feels so nice as a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">security blanket when you're doing refactoring. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1166">The other thing is you can execute these tests </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1166">that you've written in a variety of different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1171">sessions, so like &mdash; settings. The first one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1171">is, of course, in the browser, so this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">the HTML5 test suite. Run inside Q unit, inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">the browser. Pretty common. You can also run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">the same tests inside a headless browser, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">on demand, on the command line, so I'll show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1192">that right now, I'll use grunt, which is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1192">node-based command line tool and type grunt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1198">Q unit. So this is actually going to fire </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1198">up phantom.js, which is a headless WebKit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">instance, toss in those Q unit test suite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">and then check that those indeed five assertions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">did pass. So I'm able to run the exact same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">tests just without leaving my command line </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">here. I can also run this &mdash; run tests after </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1217">I push it up to version control, and let something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">like continuous integration server test these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">things, so we do this on the modernizer project. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">So this is Travis. Every time we put up a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">new commit on GitHub, Travis comes in, pulls </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1234">down the latest, and actually does a similar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1234">thing, it takes our Q unit test, throws it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">into phantom.js, and then &mdash; and then we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1240">looking good. It tells us if we're indeed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">passing or had a little bit where I made some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">commits and broke some things. We fixed that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1253">It's good. Another cool one. This is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">nice, again, from Ryan Setton. He wrote a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">tool where we can take tests, not only get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">results on the command line, but be able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1264">test browsers in the cloud, so I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1264">take this same test suite that's in Q unit, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">and toss it to bunyup, and bunyup will then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">take that and call up a browser static, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1279">has a lot of browsers in the cloud and also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1279">mobile emulators. I'm not going to wait for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1284">this finish, but it just called up some IOS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1284">emulators, and it's gonna &mdash; and it can check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1290">my test suite against those and get the results </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1290">back. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1293">So this is really nice. I can write my tests, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1293">be able to execute them, in a number of different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">devices and browsers on the fly without ever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">leaving right here. All right. When you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">a build system, you wrote all this stuff, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">you need to get it out to production. A lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">of things you need to do with a pretty hefty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1310">Web app, and tackling all of these on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1316">own every time &mdash; every time you make changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1316">is not going to work out so well, so you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">going to need some help. I'm going to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">into a little bit of this later. But after </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">you deploy, one of the things that I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">that we often forget is keeping track of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1330">errors that clients have. So this is a screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1330">shot from errorception, and it's showing my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">report from a Web app that I somewhat hastily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">put up with some friends, and telling me that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">I actually have &mdash; people are hitting some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">JavaScript errors in I9 and Chrome, and, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1351">know, I didn't hit any of these errors, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1351">none of the other developers did, but &mdash; but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">real users in the field are hitting these, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1356">so I can get these reports and make sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1360">I can fix all these for everyone. Okay. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1360">that was a lot of stuff, and sorry, but &mdash; so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1371">I was showing a lot of things, and it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1371">kind of like this is here, this is here, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1376">the feeling that I got was that this was kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1376">of like &mdash; I mean, there's a lot of tools, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">and they're all useful, but they kind of didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1380">have this smooth integration, so me and some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1386">people on my team thought about this and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1386">thought maybe there's something that we could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1390">do to kind of make this work flow a bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1390">smooth. And so I'm going to talk to you today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1395">about a project that we're going to show off </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1395">called Yeoman. So the ideas behind Yeoman </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">is that we think you should be able to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">from your idea to a rough prototype in ten </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">minutes. I say "rough", but I mean like a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1408">prototype that you're actually going to continue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1412">developing, like you're using all the tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1412">inside that prototype that you would normally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1417">use in a Web app, and you're going to keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1417">going from that. We also want to make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1421">that we can reduce friction from the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1421">that you should be doing, such as testing. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1425">And now, you probably heard that you should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1425">not repeat yourself when you're coding; same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1430">thing applies to your tools. You shouldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1430">have to type &mdash; you shouldn't have to run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1435">build.sh every single time you change a file. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1435">So these things should be automatic. So what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1443">Yeoman is is it's an open source set of tools, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1443">frameworks, libraries, that accelerate building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">good Web apps. So has some things in it, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">authoring abstractions, linting, testing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1455">build tools, these things that I've been talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1455">about, but we've been focusing on providing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1461">nice, smooth developer ergonomics so it feels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1461">good to use. So there's a few things inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">of it. Things &mdash; these names you should be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">familiar with: Compass, sass, CoffeeScript, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1473">module support, by the way of AMD, and ecmascript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1473">6. We'll get to that in a minute. Twitter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">bootstrap, stripped HTML5 boilerplate, some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1480">testing things, Jasmine, phantom jas, image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1486">compression. All right. So I'm going to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1486">a demo and I'm actually going to skip the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">first step, the first step is a little shell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">script that gets your developer environment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1497">all set and going, gets you installed with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1497">node and NPM and home brew. Get a few of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1504">dependencies out of the way. You're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1504">to want, because, you know, sometimes I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1507">end up switching to a new machine, and getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1507">your own developer environment going takes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">awhile. So we wanted to make sure that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">could get rid of that &mdash; an old set in a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1516">minutes. All right. So I'm going to go to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1516">temp. Nice. All right. We're going to kick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">off a new project. So a lot of what we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">in Yeoman is accessible on the command line, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1534">and so I can just type Yeoman command, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1534">we have a few things available in here. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1541">have init, build, server, test, and some other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1541">stuff we're going to get to later. So what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1547">we're going to do here is we're going to start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1547">a new project. I'll name this project IO app. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1553">And inside our app, we're going to type Yeoman </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1553">in it. Cool. So we're starting off a new project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1562">Things are good. It's going to ask us a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1562">questions. What's the name of the project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1566">Description. It's going to pull a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1566">of the get metadata from my get config, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1572">some of these defaults probably will make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1572">sense for me. And that's good. Now, it's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">to take all of this and create a nice little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1577">package .json file which I might want. Now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">there's a few things it's going to ask me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">if I want. Do I want Twitter bootstrap? Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1587">Required JS? I'll pull that in for now. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1587">experimental support for ecmascript 6 modules, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1593">let's do it. All right. I say yes, we get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1593">a bunch of files written and we're good. Just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">to show kind of what this created, I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1599">to take a tree and pipe it through to Les, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1603">so let's see, we've got a good deal of bootstrap </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1603">here, and then bootstrap &mdash; a little bit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1613">HTML5 boilerplate going on here, some more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1613">bootstrap, Jasmine going on down here. Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1621">Now &mdash; now, the next thing I'm just going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1621">to open this up inside my text editor, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">so we have here a little stripped version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">of HTML5 boilerplate and I'll add in some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1638">text, and I'm actually just going to use a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1638">little bit of zen coding to save some time. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">Nice. Hello I/O. Yeoman in action. Now, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">have a server built into Yeoman. And the cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">thing here is that we're actually taking &mdash; because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">when you run a server, you actually want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">be able to watch your changes too. So you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">set up a server. It immediately actually opens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">up that result inside the browser as well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">and you're off. So now I'm going to open up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">my style sheet. All right. And we have in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">here, we're going to pull in Twitter bootstrap, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">and I'll bring that in here, and now watch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">as I hit save on this file. Hit save. I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">watch task. Notice that it immediately changes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1694">And then we run it through compass, we hit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1699">the reload task and you saw that it changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1699">up here. So I'm now able to add whatever I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">want inside my text editor, and get immediate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">results down at the bottom, or in my browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1714">So do a little bit of styles here. Save. That </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1714">looks pretty good. A little bit of color over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1722">here. Save. Nice. Cool. So I'm able to just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1722">go run all this immediately through Coffee </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">Script &mdash; sorry, through compass, compile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">it down to my resulting CSS and then get the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1739">results immediately showing over here. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1739">cool thing is that we're actually not even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1742">using any sort of Chrome extension to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1742">the lab reload functionality inside &mdash; inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1749">the view in my browser. Now, this is cool, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1749">and I wanted to bring up testing, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">I mentioned that before. We can just go over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">to slash test, and we have our Jasmine test </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">suite, all green, looking good, we see in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">the browser, looks good. Like I said before, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">I think it's really nice to have this available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">at the command line two, so we'll type in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">Yeoman test. We're going to take that jasmine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">suite and throw it into phantom.js and get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">our same passing results. Cool. I should mention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">here that we're using grunt again to use a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">lot of this system level functionality. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">a great project for this sort of thing, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">we're leaning heavily on it. All right. Cool. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">Now, let's move over to another project. I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">want to bring up this application, and we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">kick it off right now. Bring this up. Nice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1815">All right. So this should look pretty familiar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">to you. This is your standard to-do app. Common </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">&mdash; a large portion of this came from the to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">do MBC project where you can see a basic to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">do app built in a number of different frameworks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">and libraries. So let's see, go to I/O, do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1840">a talk. Nice. Cool. So we've got this basic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1840">functionality, and that's good. I want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1846">show a little bit of how this was built. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1846">right inside here, we view source, and we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1852">pulling in required.js and the main module </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1852">that we're pulling in is main. And so I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">actually going to take a quick detour and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">talk about modules. All right. So modules, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">the quick elevator pitch on modules is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">the key to building a large Web app is to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1872">not construct a large Web app; it is to break </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1872">it up into small libraries and small parts. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1879">Writing code into small files feels good, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">and we can do that when we use modules. With </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">structured modules we can also define what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1886">our dependencies are, and when we do this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1891">we're actually able to just define our dependencies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1891">a single time, so let's say we're not using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1896">modules, so you would probably have your HTML </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1896">file, you would have bunch of script tags </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">in the order that they need to be in, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">then you have your build system which is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1905">to, you know, concatenate all your files, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1905">and you have to specify your order and your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">dependencies over there as well. Modules we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">can only &mdash; we can just define that structure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">just in one place. Another advantage is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">as you develop, you might stop using code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1922">and in modules, code you stop using just gets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1922">stripped out when it goes out to builds. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1929">there's a few different ways to write modules, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1929">and I'm going to show two of them here. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1933">first is AMD modules, so these are asynchronous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1933">modules. They have dependency resolution, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1939">help you to not write global variables, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1939">it has a very rich plug-in ecosystem that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1946">I'm going to show as well as smart-build optimization. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1946">So this is an example of, let's say, a to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">do controller, and we're going to pull in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">this file, and bring it in to our app as a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">to do view, and then our to do controller </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">is going to return an object that includes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1966">some stuff and then a render method. All right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1966">Cool. Now, on to the next module. This is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">ES 6 modules, ecmascript 6 also ecmascript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">harmony. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1979">Now, this is actually coming from ecmascript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1979">committee, TC39, who thought that, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">people were kind of doing this in the JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1987">world; let's find a way to make this actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">happen in the language itself, so offering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">a native solution. Has a flexible syntax, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">beyond what we have just down here, so what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">we have is we're pulling in a module called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">"to do view", from this file, and importing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">it into this file, we have some functionality, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2009">and then we can export whatever we want, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2009">in this case we're going to export a function </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2012">called render where we do some stuff. Actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2012">point out I am saying ES 6. There is a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2020">bit of conversation happening like right now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2020">about if this is going to make it into ecmascript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">version 6 or the next version after that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">so we'll see how that goes. But we wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">to experiment with this, and see if Yeoman </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">could give us an ability to try out this style. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">So back to &mdash; back to the code. I said that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">this was using required.js, so I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">open up the &mdash; our source of this app, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2048">I'll open up main.js. So this is the module </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">it's pulling in, and looks like we're initializing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">an app right after we pull in the task app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">module, and we have a little coffee script </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">pre-filter on this, so looks like &mdash; all right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2073">cool. So this is indeed AMD, but it is of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2073">course CoffeeScript. You can see at the top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2083">we're playing in a few other modules into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2083">this file, and then we have our application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">set up where we're defining our structure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">of our to dos. Now, one of these modules that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2097">we're pulling this is this fun module, nice. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2097">And we're pulling it in with an HM pre-filter, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2105">stands for harmony. So I'm going to go over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2105">to that real quick. Fun. All right. So this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2113">here is an ecmascript harmony module. We are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2113">pulling a few things into it. So we're pulling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">in speech, from &mdash; from this guy over here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">and this is actually the E speak speech synthesizer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2129">client, and the cool thing about this speech </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2129">synthesizer is that it's actually written </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2137">in C++, but it was run through emscripten </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2137">which is a research project by Mozilla that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2143">can port C++ into JavaScript, and so now we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2143">taking that and we're exposing it through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">ecmascript harmony modules and bringing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">out, so we pull in this module, and we also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2157">got this guy going on here, and down here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2157">we're going to use this speech module at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2163">bottom, and pull out this speak method. Cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2163">Coming back into our app. I can see down here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2172">when we create a new item, I'm going to uncomment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2172">out this guy, and comment out this guy. Nice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2182">Come back here, and refresh the page. Good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2182">And now let's try this out. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2189"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Remember to ace the demo. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2189"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah. Nice, cool. So nailed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2196">it. Awesome. All right. So the cool thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2196">here is that we have a C++ library that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">ported into JavaScript via emscripten, exposed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">via ecmascript 6 module into our CoffeeScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">application compiled down into ecmascript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">5 JavaScript, and now we've got a (indiscernible), </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">so I think we're in a good place. Cool. All </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">right. One of the things that we wanted to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2228">do with Yeoman is find out how we can iterate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2228">on it in a way that kind of was based on how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">people are using it. So we have a thing in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2234">there that can report exactly anonymous metrics </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2241">around what are the commands that are typed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2241">in, so any kind of Yeoman commands, and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">way we can get a better idea on how people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">are using it, so they can make good changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">and really make sure that the tool fits its </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">users. Another thing that it can do is answer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2258">questions like what's the popularity difference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2258">between backbone and ember, or what's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2264">adoption rate of ES 6 modules? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2264">So I think this is really cool. And we also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2271">want to make sure that all this &mdash; all this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2271">data is accessible to anyone that wants to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">see it. I want to take a moment just to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">about package management. So I don't know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">about you guys, but if I have to update like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">a library that I depend on somewhere, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">first thing that happens is someone probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2289">tells me, hey, that Jay creates 1.5 up to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2295">1.8 alpha. You should probably update. Okay, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2295">okay. I'll go to the site, I'll find the download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2300">button, and I'll download that to my downloads, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2300">then I'll move that into the app folder, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2305">then I'll like fix the script tag because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2305">it's a new version file and fix that, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2309">that's &mdash; that's not great, so why do we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2309">package management for clientside JavaScript? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">Because what I just described is not fun. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">And then more like an Ecosystem level, common </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2322">code gets duplicated across a good size app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2322">you probably have code to bind a function </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2328">to a scope like four times. Another thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2328">that happens is that libraries get fragmented. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2333">This is why we have things like the jQuery </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2333">empire and then the YUI and dojo and closure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2338">areas where things are not really interoperable, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2338">and we have fragmented communities and libraries. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2345">So with package management, we can have something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2345">like a longer dependency chain. A good example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2353">of this is the Chaplin project which helps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2353">building applications in backbone. Chaplin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2358">depends on backbone and some other libraries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2358">which depend on jQuery and underscore. That </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2363">comes really easy. Better package management, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2363">we can define that dependency tree which informs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">a build system to be really smart about building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">that out for a very optimized output for production. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2375">Then as a library author, it's really nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2375">for your users to both consume your library </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2380">as a regular old install and also as a dependency </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2380">of something else. How about instead of all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">of those steps, we just have something Yeoman </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">installed backbone, we have to update it instead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2391">of all of these steps, Yeoman, very casually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2391">hey, man, JavaScript library update, you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2395">got to update your backbone, it's the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2395">thing. You're like, cool, cool, I got it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2403">Yeoman, update backbone. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2403">So I'm going to show you a quick look at Bower. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2408">Bower is a package manager, it's being built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2408">by Jacob Thorton, who is one of the devs behind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">Twitter bootstrap and Alex MacCaw behind The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">Spine (indiscernible). </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2422">And what we did is we basically took Bower </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2422">and wrapped it right inside of Yeoman so that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2430">again this accesses through the same interface. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2430">So we're over here in the I/O app and we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2439">do Yeoman install backbone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2439">So right now, what it's doing, is Yeoman is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2448">talking to Bower, Bower is going to go and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2448">talk to the registry, say, Hey, I need backbone, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">cool. I just got the backbone package, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">dependent &mdash; my dependencies are underscore </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2462">and jQuery, please get those, okay, cool, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2462">got those. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2465">And now we've installed into our app into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2465">the js browser modules backbone jQuery and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2472">underscore. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2472">So if I go into js browser modules, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2477">all of our files right there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2477">So I'm saving a lot of time not going and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2482">getting all of these things and keeping them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2482">up to date. I'm able to manage my dependencies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2485">from my app right here on the command line, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2485">which is really nice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2490">So this is &mdash; this is where things are going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2490">with that. So &mdash; so in summary for Yeoman, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2496">we can start out new projects really easily. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2496">We get a fast, iterative loop when we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2503">doing development. Understanding preprocessors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2503">like Sass and CoffeeScript, module systems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2511">like AMD and ES6. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2511">I didn't show how we can run our files against </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2518">js hint. Or even the build script, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2518">pretty robust. It's built actually on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2525">original build script for the HTML5 boilerplate. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2525">But we have done a lot of research into image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2531">optimization and found the most effective </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2531">loss list image compression we can do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2537">So Yeoman is available on the dev val for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2537">preview, if you go to Yeoman.io you can sign </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2543">up and get notified when it's totally ready. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2543">We're just doing a little bit of buckling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2550">to make sure that we're looking good. We also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2550">want to make sure that our package manager </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2554">has enough packages so that when you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2554">to start an app and add things, everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2558">is there for you as you want it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2558">So we're letting in a few people, just to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2563">kind of kick the tires and we'll have it out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2563">available for everyone publicly soon. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2568">All right. So ... summary. Tools are your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2568">friends, they're good, they increase your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2572">productivity, lower your stress, help you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2572">out when you use them in a work flow that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2576">works really well for you. We're working on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2576">Yeoman. Tell &mdash; make it easier to consume </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">these smart tooling choices and help you build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">compelling web apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2585">And thank you very much. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2624"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I saw Jasmine, is there going to be other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2628">testing like plug-ins or &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2628"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: So since we are built on &mdash; on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2634">Grunt, if you are familiar with that, swapping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2634">it out for &mdash; for a different testing suite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2643">is as easy as editing the Grunt file. So it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2643">not too bad. But we &mdash; we made choices that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2649">&mdash; we wanted to have some smart defaults in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2649">there, so we went with Jasmine because we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2656">really like its style. So it is configurable, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2656">but we wanted to have something that gets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2662">you off and going from the start. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2662"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Awesome. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2665"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Cool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2665"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Can I get an invite? [Laughter] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2668"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2668">You talk to me, talk to me. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2674"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Um, when you &mdash; after you installed Yeoman </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2674">and you were making changes, changes were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2680">loading in the browser, was that live reload </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2680">or was that something in Yeoman? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2684"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: So we are actually leveraging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2684">the JavaScript shim that the live reload project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2693">used and we're injecting that into the page. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2693">And so we're using a portion of the live reload, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2699">but it's really just JavaScript that's making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2699">that happen. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2703"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. So ensure one doesn't have to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2703">live reload to have that feature. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2706"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Right. That feature comes through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2706">Yeoman, so you don't even have to have anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2712">else installed yet. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2712"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2714"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So you showed us the testing and the development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2714">side. I'm guessing part of the build process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2719">that you didn't have time to show us was building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2719">for deployment. Would that also include being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2724">able to use the closure compiler to have source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2724">mapping? Um ... yeah. Right now, um &mdash; right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2733">now our build step goes through uglify, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2733">we're looking at a nice way to run it through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2740">a closure compiler, because I like source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2740">maps just as much as you do. So there's &mdash; there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2747">a few issues and discussions open to get source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2747">mapping into Uglify and to CoffeeScript, neither </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2754">of them have landed yet. So we're waiting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2754">for that, but in the meantime, yeah, I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2758">really love to find a nice way to get source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2758">maps into the closure compiler. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2761"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Right. And there was an issue around having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2761">multiple source maps and trying to read from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2766">each other. I'll catch you at the code lab. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2766"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Sure, yeah, sounds good. Sir? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2772"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: All right. What kind of requirements do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2772">I need &mdash; for my server when I want to deploy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2781">this Yeoman created app? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2781"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Um, no specific requirement. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2787">It's completely up to you. So &mdash; so it's &mdash; it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2787">basically we don't make any requirements as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2795">far as your back end. It stays completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2795">client side only whereas another solution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2799">might say this is your database on the backend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2799">or we're going to serve it up to Engine X </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2803">or something like that, but that is completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2803">up to you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2806"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I see. Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2806"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Yes, sir, one more. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2812"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: This one is for Louie. So how much do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2812">you know about like the Bower package manager, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2820">how hard is it going to be to get a package </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2820">into it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2825">I noticed that it looked like it was cloning, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2825">so if you push that back up to GitHub, like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2829">is there like weird issues? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2829"><span class="speakerName">Paul Irish</span>: Um ... well, I can answer the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2838">first part at least. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2838">So it was previously called nest and I'm accessing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2842">it, this way. And registering a new package </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2842">is as easy as that. Bower. Register the name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2852">and the URL of the get repo. It's very, very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2852">easy and there's a package.json file that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2859">has the meta data available for the package. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2859">There's no strict dependency on GitHub, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2864">there is a strict dependency on git, and clone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2864">each package, find out its dependencies and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2872">the team is finding ways to optimize that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2872">and say, for instance, grab the zip download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2878">if it's a GitHub situation instead of cloning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2878">the entire repo, finding out how to make that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2887">really nice. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2887">Cool? All right. Thank you guys, appreciate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2888">it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2888">[ Applause ] </span></p></div>
