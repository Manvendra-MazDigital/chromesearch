<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="0"><span class="speakerName">Alex Danilo</span>: Hello, everybody. And welcome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">here tonight. You have waited for the keynote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">act, I see. We're the last act of the day, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">best of the day, of course. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2">So I guess you're all wondering why Adobe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">is here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2">The answer to that is they're a very valued </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">contributor to the WebKit project, and WebKit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="6">project is of course the core of Google Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="6">and a lot of other nice browsers out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="11">And of course, we like to share because of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="11">course the Web is about sharing. And what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">I mean is I don't mean social media. I mean </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">they're a bunch of mad scientists &mdash; actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">visionary physicists back in the early '90's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">&mdash; and they decided they wanted to share physics </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">stuff, like scientific papers, so they built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">the first Web browser and Web server. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">then a few years later Marc Andreesen came </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">along and said, Well, images would be cool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">and he added images to the browser. And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">over the years, as you've seen, the evolution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">of the Web has just gotten better and better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">and we have all these amazing features today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="43">So basically the Web is open and so Adobe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">and Google we all work on Web technology, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">we work with a lot of other companies as well. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="48">So enough about that. Who are we? My name </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">is Alex Danilo, and I'm a developer advocate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">on Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="60">And with me I have Christian Cantrell, who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">is a product manager, a developer himself, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">so he knows a lot of the stuff that you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="67">And we also have Vincent Hardy, who is a principal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">scientist. And Vincent and I have worked on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">CSS and SVG for a number of years now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="71">So the Web is evolving and that's a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">good thing because we don't really want the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="77">browser from the early '90's, do we? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">And the thing is what we're seeing now is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">along the timeline of Web browser evolution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">all these new features have been coming in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">and coming in and the feature set is accelerating. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="91">New features are not just accelerating, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="91">there an accelerating acceleration. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="96">So the thing is what do you do as a developer? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">It's like we want to help you. And that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">why we built Chrome. Chrome is built for simplicity, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">security and speed. And what's going to give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">you simplicity is tools. It better tools to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">make your job easier and that will give you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">more time because it will make your development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">job faster, so we give you simplicity and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">speed, and that's what we're going to show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">you today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="118">Now, what are you supposed to do as a Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">developer? Come to Google I/O. And the second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">thing is go watch all the YouTube stuff, go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">watch it afterwards, enjoy it, get all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">demo material, experiment with it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="128">And one thing I would really like everyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">in this room and everyone watching to do is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">to talk to us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="136">The Web is about people, it's open, we share, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">and we listen to you. So if you as a Web developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">sit around and you go like, "Oh, I wish CSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">did that," come and tell us, we'll try and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">push it through the standards bodies, we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">get the other browser makers to do it and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">we'll do it together. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="150">So anyway, this is the kind of thing we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">trying to promote today, more creative options. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="154">The old days used to muck up a wire frame, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">give it to the Web developer who writes JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">and something pops out the other side. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="163">And we want to change that workflow. We want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">to, like, bring on the declarative Renaissance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="169">So we're putting features in the browser that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">are declarative. They're not JavaScript. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">we're providing tools so the designers can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">come along and go, Well, I can build that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">page myself. I don't need to give it to a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">JavaScript programmer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="181">And so Adobe, of course, had a rich history </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">in topography and fonts and graphics, so the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">stuff we'll see today is a whole lot of new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">CSS features, from magazine style layouts, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">some cinematic effects and amazing graphic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">type stuff, and of course we bring this all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">to you in Chrome. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="197">And if you're sitting there going, "Oh my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">God, my users use IE, a really old version, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">what do we do about that," well, we give you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">Chrome Frame as well so you can have Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="205">and Chrome Frame and they provide the platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">on which you can make these incredible new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="213">The other thing is we bring tools, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">Chrome Developer Tools, and of course Adobe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">we're about to show you some new tools they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">have been working on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="220">And of course with their tools and our tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">it creates a synergy that makes your workflow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">so much easier and smoother. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="224">And of course, the one thing that I'll emphasize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">yet one more time is that the Web is open, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">the Web is everybody's, and we both participate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">in the W3C and a number of other standards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">organizations. In fact, there are over 370 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">companies who are participating in the W3C </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">and they steer the direction of the Web. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">if you want a new feature, come to us, we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">do it for you, okay? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">So on that note I'll pass it over to Christian </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">and he shall tell you all about these features. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="252"><span class="speakerName">Christian Cantrell</span>: Thank you, Alex. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="252">So I think probably the best way to understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">the perspective of Adobe when it comes to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">helping to move the Web forward is to look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">at the Web platform team's official "Le Motto," </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">which is a better Web and awesome tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="270">So I'm going to be talking about three things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">that are going to help us achieve that goal, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">the first of which is text. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="277">So the Web is already a very powerful platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="282">for text, so Adobe wanted to build on that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="282">because we really wanted to bring magazine-like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">layout to the Web. And we want to do that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">&mdash; we're doing that in primarily two ways </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">with two specifications and two implementations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">as well, CSS Regions and CSS Exclusions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="300">The example you see here is using CSS Exclusions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">to have some text flow along the edge of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="307">mountain. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="307">Here's another example where you see text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">flowing between different regions, in this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">case to make columns, also flowing along these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">images here. So this is combining CSS Regions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">and CSS Exclusions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="320">Now, this is the kind of thing that you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">probably accustomed to seeing, we're all accustomed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">to seeing really in print and magazines or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">something like that. Usually not something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">that you would see on Web. Something like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">this the Web would typically have been laid </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">out in another application, a screen shot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">would have been taken or something strange </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">like that, which obviously we don't want. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="335">We really want true magazine-like layout with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">the Web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="340">So I'm going to start with the CSS Regions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">and this is just sort of a brief overview. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="344">The concept of CSS Regions is actually quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">simple. You have a block of text here, a flow, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">you have some elements here which are your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">regions, and with a couple of lines of very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">simple declarative CSS, that text can start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">flowing through those regions. It's that simple. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="361">I'm going to actually start with a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">of demos to help illustrate the point. In </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">addition to being a developer at Adobe I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">also a science fiction writer. And I frequently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">write things and release them under a creative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">comments license online. And when I release </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">them they tend to look something like this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">which is to say ugly, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">So I put a lot of work into the story and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">then I release it in a way that I'm not really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">that proud of. And the reason is because I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">want it to work on as many devices as possible. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="392">I know people like to read on phones, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">like to read on tablets, they like to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">all kinds of different types of browsers and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">machines, so I try and make it sort of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">lowest common denominator. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="407">But it honestly doesn't look that good, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">when I started working with CSS Regions I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">was really excited about what I could do with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">my own work and how I could present it in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">a much more interesting fashion. So this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">the same story which I've applied some regions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">to. And you can see that I have a page count </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">up here, which is nice, and you can see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">my text is flowing from region to region here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">all automatically. I have some page numbers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">down here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="432">If I were to resize my browser here you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">see the page count in the upper right-hand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">corner is changing. As the page count changes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">if I drag it up and decrease the height of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">the available space you can see the pages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">have automatically adjusted themselves. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="448">So this is a much nicer experience and something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">that I can be a little bit more proud of. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="452">I have a couple more prototypes, but I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">to go ahead and skip to the last one, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">is my favorite. I call this the sort of adaptive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">or responsive prototype. And this is unique </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">because it's designed not just to work on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">any size screen, it's designed to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">be optimized for any size screen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="473">So this is the same story once again, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">it uses &mdash; it has some gestures where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">can turn pages. It uses some heuristics to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">determine the optimal width for a column and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">the optimal &mdash; the maximum number of columns </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">it can fit. And you can see if you have much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">higher resolution, it will automatically determine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">your column width for you and add more columns. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="497">Even the graphic here on the left-hand side </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">is scales as I change the column width because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">it's done with SVG. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="503">So this thing &mdash; this layout is going to work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">on a screen as big as a wall or something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">as small as just a phone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="513">So I had a lot of fun working with my own </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">content with this. And I started thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">that I really wanted to be able to consume </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">other content on the Web in a really nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">way as well. And you know, I really wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">to be able to just sort of reflow content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">into sort of a magazine or book-like format </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">really easily, so I started experimenting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">with this Chrome extension that I call Qualify. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="533">And when I click on this extension up here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">all the content on the page is just automatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">reflowed using CSS Regions in a way that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">think is much nicer to consume, and it's all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">adjustable based on font size and all that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="552">As an aside, if you guys went to any of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">shadow DOM sessions or Web component sessions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">this is actually using the shadow DOM, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">it's not polluting the DOM at all. So as far </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">as the DOM is concerned, you know, if there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="561">are scripts running on the DOM or something, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">actually nothing has changed here at all. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="565">It's all done behind the scenes on the shadow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">DOM. If you have no idea what I'm talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">about, shadow DOM is awesome. Check it out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="575">Okay. So since we're making contributions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="575">directly to WebKit, any browser that leverages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">WebKit is going to receive the benefits of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">those contributions. And in this case the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">Chrome beta &mdash; actually, I shouldn't say beta </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">anymore, it's not in beta anymore since like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">yesterday, I guess. So Chrome on Android also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">has some CSS Regions support, so this is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">screen shot I took from my Galaxy Nexus. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="595">So let's look at some code. The first thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="603">I want to point out here is just a simple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="603">selector called content. And it has a property </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">called flow-into here. And this flow-into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">property is creating a named flow called article. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="615">And what's notable about this is that my content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="615">is just going to be a big block of semantic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">text. So I'm not worried about, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">creating divs or some form of element that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">are regions and copying and pasting text into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="628">each one. Obviously that would defeat the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">whole purpose. That's not really flowing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="632">You could have done that forever. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="636">So you have this semantic block of text which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">is content and it knows nothing about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">way it's going to be laid out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="640">And then I have this class called region. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="645">And it has a flow-from property here, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">it's referring to this named flow article, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">which is defined up here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="652">So with just that I'm able to get text flowing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">between regions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="657">Now, what about getting paging capabilities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">and, you know, the swiping effects and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="662">columns and the layout and all that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">In order to do that you will have to write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">some code. You're going to have to tap into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">the CSS object model. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="671">And it's not a lot of code. It actually pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">straight forward, and I'll just go through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">it. We started our layout with a function </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">called add region here, and I created a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">region. And I'm going to set this attribute, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="685">the class attribute, to region, which we saw </span><span class="line" data-startTime="685">in the previous slide is the named flow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="689">And this is a really important line of code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">right here, this region.addeventlistener. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="692">So we're gonna add this region.addeventlistener </span><span class="line" data-startTime="692">to our region, and we're going to call this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">function called on layout update. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="698">Basically what this is saying is if the text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">inside that region changes in any way, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">text is added, if text is removed, if the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">font size changes, if the element is resized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">for any reason, then call this on layout update </span><span class="line" data-startTime="711">function so that I can run some &mdash; you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="711">take a look at the page, figure out what happened </span><span class="line" data-startTime="716">and update my layout. And then just add that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="716">region to the &mdash; pin that region to the body </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">of the document. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="721">So let's look at this on layout update function. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="725">Again, this is called whenever my flow changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">within my regions, so I get a reference to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">the region from the event target, nice and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">straightforward, and then I start looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">at this region overflow property. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="733">And if the value of that property is overflow, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">which is to say if there's more text than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">actually fits in that region, then I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">to need to add another region. So I sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">recursively call this add region function, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">Otherwise if it fits, then call region layout </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">complete and you're done, you can do your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">layout and stuff. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="755">So what's missing from this is the code that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">determines the width of your regions, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">placement of your regions, the left, right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="759">top, bottom, and all of those kinds of things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="764">It puts page numbers and the scrolling effects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">and all that, but that stuff's actually not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="768">all that bad. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="768">And the very first prototype that I wrote, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">I wrote that in, you know, a day. The last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">one, you know, I sort of built a few prototypes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="775">takes a couple of days. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="775">And these are the kinds of things that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">will write, they'll open source. I'll open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">source everything I've done here along with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">a qualified plug-in so people can see how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">it's done. So it's not bad to do all this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">stuff yourself, but we know that it has to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">be easier. We know that people want to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">it in a declarative way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="791">And so we've proposed something called CSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">page templates. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="797">And CSS page templates really come from our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">experience with tools like InDesign, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">is what you're looking at here. This is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">screen shot of InDesign where I've created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="804">some master pages. One master page has an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">image in the upper left-hand corner, another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">master page has an image in the center here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">with two columns of text on either side. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="812">And what I can do is I can just add pages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="818">to my document and just apply these master </span><span class="line" data-startTime="818">pages to those pages and they're automatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">formatted the way I want them. So it's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">nice and easy. We've learned from building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">these kinds of tools that, you know, people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">want easy ways of doing these kinds of things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="829">So let's take a look at CSS page templates. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="829">We're going to look at it in two parts. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">first one is the flow. And this is probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">pretty familiar because this is more or less </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">what we just looked at, except for instead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">of creating one named flow, I'm creating two. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="844">So I have a selector called article and a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="844">selector called timeline and I'm creating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">two named flows here, the article flow and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">the timeline flow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="853">And then I have this selector here, combine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">articles. And it has this interesting property </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">called overflow style. And I'm saying page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">X. So this line of code is basically saying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">"Don't call my &mdash; don't call my event handler </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">and make me have to add regions and lay them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">out and all that, just page X, page along </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">the X axis," in other words, page horizontally. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="874">So the templates themselves, you use this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">@ syntax to define them. So we have an outer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="881">definition of a template here and then we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="881">have slots inside of the template. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="884">In this case we have a left template and a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">right template. Both of these are getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="887">their content from this article flow. Then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="887">we have a center slot which is getting its </span><span class="line" data-startTime="893">content from the timeline flow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="893">So pretty straightforward, simple, declarative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">stuff, CSS that everyone is comfortable with, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">and the result is something like this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="901">We have some English text here which is flowing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">from left column to the right column, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">then we have this German text which constitutes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">a timeline which is flowing along the center </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">column. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="909">And it's paging along the X axis as we specified, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">or in other words paging horizontally. There </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">are seven pages total. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="920">And all of that was just with a few lines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="920">of declarative CSS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="923">Now, this is still a proposal; however, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">do have shims or polyfills, JavaScript polyfills </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">or shims, that you can use to actually see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">this stuff in action and actually see it work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="934">And we'll have a URL on that at the end of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="934">the presentation. It's not enough, though, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">just to be able to flow text from region to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">region. If you really want true magazine-like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">layout you need more powerful tools than that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">or I should say additional tools. And this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">is a screen shot of InDesign. This is where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">somebody has flowed some text around a clipping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">path here. Right? Again, that's something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">we're used to seeing in print. We want this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">on the Web. This is an example of it happening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">on the Web. Again, this is both CSS Regions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">where text is flowing between regions, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">also the exclusions where text is flowing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="968">along the contours of this image. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="968">So where are we with CSS Exclusions right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">now? We're really focused on some of the low </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">level implementations which really involve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">the optimization of algorithms that flow text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="983">around polygons and inside of polygons. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="989">I'll actually show you a quick demo here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="989">This is something that one of our engineers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">put together. And you can see that this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">just sort of an example of an algorithm that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">determines on the left side how a text should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">flow inside of some arbitrary polygon. In </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">this case it's a star shape. And on the left </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">it's content flowing around the polygon. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1013">And so this is stuff that has to be really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">bulletproof and has to be really performing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1019">So right now we're really focusing on optimizing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1019">those algorithms. They're going to be contributing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">directly to the WebKit, and that's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">be the foundation on top of which we build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">Exclusions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1026">Okay. So this is a really busy slide. I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1030">not going to go over this. This would bore </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1030">you guys all to death. It's too late in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">day for that, but I wanted to just point out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">one really important element of this timeline. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1040">This is basically the full timeline of everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1040">from when we first started thinking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">Regions and Exclusions all the way up through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">the present. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1047">I really want to focus on this bottom row </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">here, the blue row. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1050">I was at Google I/O last year and I was working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1050">at the booth and I was demoing CSS Exclusions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1058">and Regions, and people would come up and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1058">take a look at it &mdash; and we had a prototype </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">back then. It was just a prototype build. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1063">And they'd look at it and they immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">got it, right? When you see text flowing around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">shapes and everything it's awesome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1069">And so they would say, Wait, what browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">is that? Are you using Firefox? Is that WebKit? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1072">Is that Chrome? Is that Safari? Like what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1072">is that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1075">And I would say, Well, this is actually our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1075">own prototype browser. This actually doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1080">work anywhere. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1080">And they'd like walk away kind of crest fallen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">and be like "Damn, I kind of wanted to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">that." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1087">So a year later, almost exactly a year later, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1087">all of the live demos that I showed you work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1093">in the version of Chrome that all of you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1093">on your computers right now, which is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1097">remarkable to me. That's one year's time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1097">80 percent of CSS Regions has implemented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1102">and is in Chrome and is on your computer right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1102">now. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">So we're making really good progress. As far </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">as other browsers, Mozilla has committed to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">Exclusions and Regions in their 2012 road </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">map. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1114">The preview version of IE 10 supports Regions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">and Exclusions. And since the implementation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1119">is being done directly in WebKit, we expect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1119">the next major version of Safari to pick it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">up as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1123">I'm going to change gears a little bit here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">and I'm going to talk about the Web development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">workflow, something a little different. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">Actually, instead of talking about it, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">I'll do a little demonstration. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1133">So I'm going to open up my text editor here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">and I'm going to open up a little prototype </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">website that I am going to pretend like I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">working on. And I'm going to talk about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">Web development workflow, which typically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">looks something like this. You start off in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1151">your editor. You make some kind of a change. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1151">Maybe you wonder if this menu belongs at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">top or not. So you remove it, you save it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">you alt tab over to your browser and you hit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">command R to reload. You say nah, I really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1161">wanted that. You go back, you undo, you save, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">you go back, you reload. And if you're a Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">developer, which I'm assuming that all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1171">you have at least some Web development experience, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1171">if not many years of experience, you do this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1175">thousands of times a day, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1175">It's completely ingrained in muscle memory, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1180">and it's a pretty good workflow, right? There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1180">no compilation process or anything like that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1183">It's pretty fast, pretty smooth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1183">Maybe you use something like live reload, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">which makes it even slicker. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1186">Now what happens when you add mobile into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">that workflow, as we increasingly are. If </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">you are building a website now, you are probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">thinking about mobile to some degree. Well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">you still have this workflow that I just described, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">but you have this entire additional workflow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">that's like &mdash; pulls it down and &mdash; and really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">makes it much less efficient, right? So it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">looks a little something like this, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1212">You go through that process I just described, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1212">you go okay let me check on my device. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1215">up pick up your device, and it's been a while </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1215">so it's locked. So you unlock it. And you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1219">are security conscious, because you are a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1219">at Google conference so you have to enter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1223">your PIN, of course, then you have to navigate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1223">to your browser, then you have to type in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">this URL, this long complex URL of your development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">machine or whatever it is and you make at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">least one or two mistakes, of course. Then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">you fix 'em and you check it out. Then when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">you are done with that, then you can just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">pick it up and hit reload, but you're still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1239">picking it up, unlocking it hitting reload. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1239">Picking up the next device,unlocking, hitting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1243">reload. And on the very last one, you're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1243">to find a bug, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1247">And then you're going to go back to your desktop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1247">and fix it and you're going to start all over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">again. So the really cool process that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">all pretty very much accustomed to becomes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">really pretty terrible on mobile devices when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">you incorporate mobile devices into this Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">development workflow, but I guess I shouldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">say terrible. But it's not as efficient, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">put it that way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1263">So Adobe looked at that problem and thought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">that maybe we could do something about it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">So I'm going to switch over to &mdash; to my browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">here. And assuming that I have an internet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">connection, if I'm lucky, I'm going to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1277">to the Boston Globe. I'm lucky. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1277">And the reason that I'm picking the Boston </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1282">Globe here is because this is sort of a famously </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1282">responsive website which probably required </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">thousands and thousands of combined hours </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">of testing on mobile devices so that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1293">who built this, very smart people, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1293">know the pain. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1296">Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1296">come over here and switch over to the ELMO. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1304">And I'm going to put my devices over here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1304">on the left and I'm going to put my &mdash; my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1308">left anyways &mdash; and I'm going to put my desktop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1308">over here on this screen. And what you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1313">going to see is that they're all synchronized, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1313">right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1317">And I'm going to click on an article here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1317">and they all follow along, right? So that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1323">same Web development workflow that I showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1323">you earlier, now I can &mdash; I can still do with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">all of my devices connected, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1328">I can just glance over and see. I don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">to pick them up, I don't have to change URLs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1332">I don't have to tap on links and all that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">kind of thing. There's no limit to the number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1336">of devices that you can connect to here, by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">the way. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1339">Something else I want to point out here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">Adobe shadow, it's not like bundling up this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">content and pushing it out to the devices, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1350">right? Rather it's telling the devices to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1350">go make its own request for the content. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1354">that's an important distinction because that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1354">means that the user agent and the http headers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1357">and all of the information that the server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1357">needs in order to determine the correct content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1361">to send to that particular device is all present. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1361">So you can get, you know, smaller images if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1366">you are on smaller screen or higher resolution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1366">images if you are on one of these nice new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1370">modern screens or whatever it is, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1370">So you are seeing the real deal on these devices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1377">So let's see here ... it's nice to be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">to, you know, just this much is sort of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">big win, but there's even more we can do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1383">If I click on the little shadow extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">up here in my browser, I can do some remote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1387">inspection of my device here. And so I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1394">now connected to my iPad and you can see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1394">as I start to mouse over the content, in my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">Web Inspector on my desktop, you can see this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">being highlighted on my iPad over there. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1409">So this is, you know, the kind of thing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1409">we're accustomed to doing, you know, on our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1414">&mdash; when we're doing Web development on our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1414">desktop and now it extends nicely to our devices. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1420">And we can do more than just highlight, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1420">can also change things so I can, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1424">say something like &mdash; I can change this headline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1424">to be a little more relevant to me, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1431">So I just changed the headline over here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1431">I prefer something like this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1436">I can execute some JavaScript remotely on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">any one of these devices. See I just popped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1443">up an alert here. So I will come over here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1443">and dismiss it. So after I've sufficiently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">messed up this page by vandalizing it or whatever, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">I can just come over here, pull it down and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1454">refresh it. If you guys have done development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1454">on a lot of different mobile devices, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">will know that clearing the cache is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">kind of a pain, like getting a fresh copy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1461">of everything on all of these different devices, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1461">and so shadow takes care of that for you by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">dumping the cache and making a fresh request. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1467">Or if I want to do it to all of my devices, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">I will just come over here and I will tell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">them all to refresh, so I will click on that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">I don't know if you saw, but they all just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">refreshed, it's very quick. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1479">Also I can take screen shots of all of my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1479">devices here. I'll just click on this icon, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">takes a little bit of time, open up the directory </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">here and you can see that I have &mdash; this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1490">the screen shot from my iPad, so I can compare </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1490">them all, sort of check out pixels next to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1497">each other. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1497">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1499"><span class="speakerName">Christian Cantrell</span>: Oh, thank you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1499">Awesome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1504">That is worthy of applause, I agree, thank </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1504">you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1507">This is the Galaxy Nexus here, and also some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1507">text files were created with some meta data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">so I can, you know, sort of get a good feel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">for how something looked for the specific, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">you know, URL and LS version and stuff like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1523">So &mdash; so there's shadow. It's available right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1523">now. You can go to labs.adobe.com, download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">it, see if it helps for your workflow. I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">a big fan myself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1533">Okay. I'm going to change gears again and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">talk a little bit about tooling. So tooling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1538">is something that Adobe is well known for. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1538">We do a lot of tooling, so when we were looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">at ways we can contribute to the Web, tooling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1542">was something that seemed kind of obvious. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1547">But we didn't just want to go create sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1547">of the same old kinds of tools. We really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1552">wanted to take a fresh approach and see what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1552">kind of innovation we could bring to tooling. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">So we decided to experiment with an open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">code editor for the Web written entirely with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1565">Web technologies. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1565">Just to see what would happen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1570">And what happened was something called brackets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1570">I'm going to go through a few bullet points </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1573">here and then I'll get to the demo, but I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1573">want to provide context here. First of all, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1578">it's open source. When I say it's open source, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1578">I mean it's open source, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">Like a lot of companies, they used to say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">something was open source and we'd all go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1583">oh cool it's open source, and you would look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1583">at the license and be like wait a minute. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1587">Open source is actually kind of a useless </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1587">term. So really what license? And we are releasing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1592">under MIT license, and that's a very, very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1592">liberal license. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1596">All of the codes on GitHub, even the backlog </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1596">is public. It's on a site called Trello, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1601">you can actually go see what the team is working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1601">on. So everything is being done in the public. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">There's also IRC channels and there's lists </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">and stuff like that that you can follow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1610">This is something that we realized kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">early on, which is kind of cool, this concept </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1615">if you can use brackets, you can hack on brackets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1615">If you need brackets, if you use brackets, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">you can change brackets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1619">This point was really driven home to me when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1623">I was working on my Google I/O slides and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1623">I realized I wanted brackets to be able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1628">bump up the font size so that the audience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1628">could see the code while I was demoing it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">but it didn't have that feature. It's still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">very, very early. I should point out this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1638">is still very early stages of development. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1638">So I emailed the product manager, Adam Leeman. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1643">I said, "Can you guys add this by Google I/O?" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">Or I said, "Are you planning on adding this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">by Google I/O?" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">And he responds, he says, "Here's the link," </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1652">you know, "here's a link to the public &mdash; public </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1652">backlog, you can check for yourself, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">all public, you don't have to ask me." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">And actually he didn't say it like that because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1661">he's a nice guy. But I went and I looked and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1661">it wasn't scheduled. I said, "Well, can you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1665">guys get it in?" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1665">He said, "No, but it's open source you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1667">get in." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1667">I thought, you know, that's true. Like that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1670">&mdash; like, I'm really critical of editors, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1670">We all are. Everyone in this room is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">critical about editors. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">And for the first time I just had the power </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1676">to make it how I wanted it. So I just forked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1676">it, I mean, I'm a good JavaScript programmer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1681">I forked it, you know, I cloned it, I branched </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1681">it, and I built the feature all in JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">and submitted a report request and it got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1688">merged and I added the feature. It was really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1693">empowering to be able to just change things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1693">I didn't like about the editor that I use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1697">every day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1697">I'm sorry, I forgot to change that back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1704">Thank you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1704">So brackets is intended to run outside of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">the browser for now. Right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1708">So we built it with Web technologies, we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">first thinking like wouldn't it be awesome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">to take this editor and actually run it inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1715">of a browser? We thought that might be really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1715">innovative and cool and different. Then we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1721">thought, no, probably not. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1721">We want to focus on a more traditional development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">experience right now and keep it outside of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">the browser, but we are definitely looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1728">at embedding it in the browser in the future </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1728">and accessing various cloud serves with it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1732">We are not trying to build an IDE. We are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">trying to build a streamlined editor. We are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">not trying to compete with Visual Studio, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">Eclipse or something like that. We are trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1738">to build something fast and streamlined. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1738">want it to be an editor. And so we have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">good extension model. It's an evolving extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">model, which is really designed to help us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1748">keep a lot of the things that maybe everybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1748">doesn't want out of the core product and so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">that people can just bring in what they want. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">And the last thing that I want to say is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">the core editor is codemirror, which is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">separate project which is something that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">are also actively contributing to. Okay. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">enough talk. Let's take a look at it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1764">In fact, you actually have already seen it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">so this is brackets. I was using it earlier. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1769">It's a very simple editor. I mean, I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">my files over here on the left, I have my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1772">code here on the right, and I can hide my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1772">files. You know, I have some menus up here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1776">These are actually temporary. These menus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1776">are going to become native menus. They are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">just in here temporarily. But this is it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1780">I mean it's a relatively straightforward and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">simple experience, simple UI. And the point </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">of brackets is to really sort of get out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1794">your way. And it's to sort of break down the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1794">barriers between what it is that you intend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">to do and actually doing it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1799">So if I'm looking at this piece of text right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1805">here and I decide that I want to make some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1805">kind of a change to it, let's say I want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">tweak the line height of this text, then the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1809">first thing that I have to start doing is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1813">dig through a bunch of CSS files, right? And, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1813">you know, I have to look at, you know, I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1818">to look for selector vision, I have to look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1818">for this ID, I have to look for main content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1821">or maybe article, I have to look for, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1821">know, maybe a container and I have to try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">and find where, you know, which styles are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">actually applying to this piece of text. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1832">if this is a big project, I could have a dozen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1832">CSS files, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">They could be hundreds of lines long and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">could be a real pain, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">So as I'm foraging sort of around looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">for these rules, I'm not programming, I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">not doing what I'm intending to do. It's affecting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">my productivity. So instead what I want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">do is I just want my editor to do that for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">me. I want to hit command E, I just want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1854">hit a keystroke and I want to have my editor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1854">do that for me, right? I want to have it bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1857">up this editor right here. This is an inline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1857">editor, and it's telling me exactly which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">rules apply to where my cursor was. If it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">multiple documents, it will show me the different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1867">documents right here on the right and I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1867">just pick the right one. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">And I can go down here and I can make a change, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">so maybe I change this to 33 &mdash; now, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1875">isn't just a few or perspective of my CSS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1875">This is an actual editor. You can see I just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1880">made a change and now it's this file is marked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1880">as dirty here and here and I can hit save. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1885">So I have saved it. I have actually edited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1885">the document, the CSS, inline, directly in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1890">context, which is really nice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1890">But it's not enough just to be able to edit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">the CSS. We actually need to be able to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">what we're doing and see how it's affecting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">our document. So I'm going to go up here and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">click on this lightning bolt, move this over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">to the side, and look at this, I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">bump up the font size. It's awesome. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1911"><span class="speakerName">Christian Cantrell</span>: Well, thanks! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1911">Thank you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1916">And then I'm going to put my browser over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1916">here on the left and I'm going to go back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1919">down to this paragraph that I was talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1919">about before and I'm going to open up this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1922">editor, and go down to the line height, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1922">is what I intended to do and I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1926">start tweaking the line height. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1926">You can see that it's changing there on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">left, right? Let me do something a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1930">more dramatic, let me really change it. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1935">while I'm actually changing it, I'm seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1935">what I'm doing, right? Which is going to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1942">my workflow much more efficient. Maybe I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1942">to change this margin down here a little bit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1947">So while I'm coding I'm actually seeing in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">real-time what's going on here and I can just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1953">save it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1953">Now, you &mdash; you might be accustomed to doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1956">this kind of thing in &mdash; in something like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1956">the &mdash; like the WebKit devtools, right? Where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1963">you are able to tweak your CSS, but the problem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1963">with that is that you are not doing that inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1966">of your editor, so you make all of these changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1966">and there's no way to capture them back to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1969">your source files. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1969">Let me make this full screen, bring my files </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1975">out here and bring up my index page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1975">Now, this also works with JavaScript, too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1980">So I can scroll down to, you know, some function, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1980">function call here, and drop my &mdash; drop my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">cursor next to a function here. If I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">remember the method signature, the function </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1993">signature, I can just hit command D, it brings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1993">up another editor, I can read the whole function </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">so I know what's going on. Hopefully it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">documented. In this case it's not.

So those are the things that Adobe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2027">has going on around text, around Web development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2027">workflow and some things we have going on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2033">around tooling. We also have a lot more going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2033">on that focuses more on graphics and for that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2039">I'm going to turn it over to Vincent. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2039">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2043"><span class="speakerName">Vincent Hardy</span>: Thanks, Christian. Yes, I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2043">going to talk about graphics and cinematic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">effects for the Web. One thing that I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">to point out is the tool that we're using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">for the presentation is actually, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">it's not a keynote or not a PowerPoint or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2062">it's not one of the presentation tools. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2062">actually Chromium. Slightly tweaked version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">of Chromium, but it's a Web browser running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">full screen and the whole presentation is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2072">written with HTML with actually a library </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2072">called (indiscernible) but all of the slides </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2077">are put together using HTML, so we're doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2077">this in part because it's possible, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">and also in part to test out all of the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2084">that we're working on and the type of new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">effects that we're trying to bring to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">platform or that are already available on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">the platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2093">So I'm going to start with an example. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2097">what you're looking at here is actually an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2097">SVG image embedded into an inline HTML document, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">that's something that you can do today. It </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">has a drop shadow, which is an SVG filter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2108">applied to it, it's very subtle, so you might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2108">kind of see it around the edges of the logo. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2115">And it has a gray scale filter applied to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2115">it as well. And when I hover on it, the gray </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">scale filter gets animated and the &mdash; to restore </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">the colors and you saw this kind of flag animation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2129">happening on the content. So this is using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2129">all kinds of filter effects, I will talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2136">the different kinds of filter effects that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2136">are applied here and how you write this. Another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">thing that's more subtle on this is the &mdash; is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">the &mdash; is happening in the interaction of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">the SVG MH with the background, you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">there's a slightly textured background and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">the image actually blends in the background </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">in a way that you have not seen before. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2162">is not opacity. This is actually a blind mode. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2162">And we're combining and having interaction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">between the logo and the backdrop. How do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">we do this traditionally? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2176">So &mdash; oops. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2176">Okay. All right. So traditionally, this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2186">done with &mdash; with authoring tools, so we do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2186">this with tools like Photoshop, we do with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">tools like Illustrator, or GIMP, we do this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">with tools like After Effects. Those tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2200">combined let you create better graphics, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2200">let you define complex vector effects or filter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">effects or let you play with, you know &mdash; you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">know, measures of coordinates in a space to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2212">do effects like flags. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2212">How do you do this on the Web platform, though? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2217">So this is coming to the Web. The way it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2217">coming is through a number of filter effects. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2223">We have &mdash; we have &mdash; at the bottom in gray </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2223">we have the text shadow and box shadow, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2228">I have a glitch in my rendering here. I apologize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2228">for that, but so text shadow and box shadow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">are kind of the ancestors of the modern filter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">effects that are coming. They can do simple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2239">things, but they are available, and they can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2239">be powerful. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2242">And we have the new filter property, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2242">starts to be implemented in &mdash; in the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">and starts to being &mdash; using the browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2247">If you've seen the keynote this morning, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2252">Cirque du Soleil demo was using filter effects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2252">and they are now in Chromium and WebKit as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2257">well, they are also in IE for &mdash; for scale </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2257">or vector graphics. The way you use filter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2264">effects is in one of three ways. The &mdash; this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2264">is one to start with is probably filter graphs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">those are filter defines as a set of nodes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">that you can combine to create the effect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">that you would want, very much like you would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">do in a tool. The second way is through shorthands, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2280">so filter shorthands are shorthands for filter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2280">graphs. So there are some filter types that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2285">are, you know, very common that you might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2285">want to use. And instead of repeating the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">same filter graph over and over again, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">specification provides the shorthands for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">those. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">And then the third way is custom filters or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">shaders, which gives you the full power and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">full access to the power of the GPU. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2302">a new proposal. It's being standardized right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2302">now and this is what does the GPX like the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">waving effect that we saw. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2308">So the first &mdash; the few effects about what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2314">possible today. This is just playing with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2314">text shadow and combining multiple text shadows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">of different colors. You can do a neon-like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">effect and when I hover on it, I get a nicer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2325">glow. It's very simple, and it's just combining </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2325">CSS animation and the filter property. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2332">tech shadow property, sorry. Similarly you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2332">can use a box shadow, so the box shadow will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2339">apply, (inaudible) of tech shadow, but to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2339">the box, the CSS box, and we can use it for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2346">example, to track the user's attention on, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2346">you know, where the text entry currently is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">so here I have, you know, laser saber effect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">on the text entry, and that helps the user, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2359">that helps the usability, and so it's pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2359">pleasant visually. So these are available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2363">today and people start using those on Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2363">pages. Now, let's turn to the new filter effects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">and the ones that are starting to be available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">now. The &mdash; the easiest way to use them is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2376">with shorthands, so if you'll look at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2376">way you would write this in your CSS, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2380">would just add the filter property, you would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2380">say colon, and then you'll invoke one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">filter functions, so if we do this on this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">original image, and apply, for example, a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2392">gray scale filter, I just have to say, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2392">know, filter, Colin, gray scale one, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2396">applies a full gray scale filter, and one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2396">of the beauties of this is that I can vary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2401">the parameter in the gray scale function and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2401">that can be subjected to CSS animations and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2406">CSS transitions making it extremely trivial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2406">to write, say, hover effect where, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2413">the image will go from gray scale to full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2413">color on hover. There's a bunch of those effects, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2418">not going to go through all of them, but you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2418">can see that visually they provide, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2422">already a pretty nice variety of things you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2422">can do. Now, the &mdash; oops. Having problems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2431">with my navigation. Sorry about this. As I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2431">said earlier, the shorthand filters are actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2443">shorthands for filter graphs, and filter graphs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2443">come from SVG. They are now being applied </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2448">to not just SVG element, but all of HTML, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2448">and I'm going to show you something that traditionally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2454">you would do in Photoshop, remember, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2454">many years ago I used to read those books </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">called Photoshop Wow! books, and there was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">one edition for each version of Photoshop, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2465">and they would explain how to do those, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2465">know, the combination of filter effects to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2469">do something like a chiseled gold effect, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2469">and the way you would put this on your Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2473">page is you would do it in Photoshop, you'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2473">do export this as a PNG or a JPEG and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2478">insert that into your Web page. Well, now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2478">you can design your filter, but you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2483">have to, you know, export as a PNG, it can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2483">still be text, so here I'm going to filter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2487">a piece of text, which means that my content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2487">remains searchable, et cetera, and accessible, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2494">and I can toggle that, you know, nice gold </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2494">chiseled effect. And also since this is all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2499">declarative and it's done in markup, I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2499">manipulate it &mdash; I can manipulate it dynamically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2505">in JavaScript, so here I've done something, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2505">you know, fairly simple. I hooked up one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2511">the lighting filters in this filter graph </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2511">to the position of the mouse, and as a result, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2516">when I move the mouse, the light seems to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2516">come from a different direction, so that's, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2520">you know, pretty nice flexibility. So, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2520">know, maybe you're not putting, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2525">chiseled gold on your page that often, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2525">something that's more common is something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2531">like this, curve shadows. So curve shadow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2531">is something you see on a lot of Web pages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2536">today, and the way it's implemented, right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2536">now in the best case, because there are sometimes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2543">horrible hacks, but the case use before and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2543">after elements boxes that are moved to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2548">side of the box and they're rotated, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2548">have a background box shadow on them, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2557">this is, you know, a little convoluted, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2557">is really visual effect and belongs to filters. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2562">That turns out to be fairly simple to write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2562">in &mdash; as a filter graph, and also the nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2568">thing about it, it's very easy to remain place </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2568">for script or CSS, so here I can just manipulate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2574">one of the parameters of one of the nodes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2574">in that filter graph and have varying effects. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2581">So to give you a feel of what this looks like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2581">here is a little code sample, and the thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2589">that is important to note here is that I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2589">not going to go through all the details of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2592">that filter graph, but things to remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2592">are you have a filter element, that's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2598">top element here in the light blue color, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2598">and that's what you would reference from your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2602">filter property, so the filter property will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2602">point to it, and then you have a number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2607">filter nodes that you can arrange and combine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2607">They each produce a different effect. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2612">at the end of the filter you can combine and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2612">arrange those effects and stack them up in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2616">the way you want. So that's very similar again </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2616">to what you would do in an authoring tool, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2620">and all those operation and combinations can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2620">be captured in the markup, and the nice thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2626">again is that since this is markup, this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2626">part of the DOM, and the DOM is accessible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2630">for scripts, and you can make it all dynamic. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2630">So now let's move to the last type of shaders. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2639">So since the shaders are used for the filter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2639">function again, except that you're using a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2646">new syntax for the value, instead of having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2646">a shorthand or pointing to your filter graph, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2650">we use a custom function. Before we dive into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2650">this, this is what the kind of things it does, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2657">so here you see when I hover, I start applying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2657">a filter &mdash; custom filter effect and the two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2661">things happening are first the rendering is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2661">distorted, it has this nice curvy effect applied </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2668">to it, and that's what vertex shaders do, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2668">so this is about distorting geometry and moving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2673">vertices around, and the second thing you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2673">can notice is there's a fairly subtle effect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2678">&mdash; shading effect on the rendering, so the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2678">original element that we're filtering is all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2686">white, and here you can see there're shades </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2686">of gray, and that's what (inaudible) shaders </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2690">or pixel shaders do for you. The other thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2690">that you mentioned is, you know, shaders run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2696">on the GPU, so this is, you know, usually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2696">very fast. So the model says the shaders is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2703">that &mdash; the conceptual model, when you use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2703">it, you want to author it or just use it as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2709">a shader, is that think of it as your content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2709">being rendered into an image, and then a mesh </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2718">of points or vertices is mapped on to this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2718">offscreen rendering, and what the vertex shader </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2724">lets you do is manipulate those &mdash; those mesh </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2724">points, or mesh vertices in a 3D space, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2730">that gives you the ability to do all kinds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2730">of, you know, extremely beautiful distortions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2734">in a 3D space. And that is the end of step </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2734">2. That is what the vertex shader produces. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2740">And then the last step is that you can manipulate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2740">pixel values, so once you've distorted the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2745">geometry all you want, you can then apply </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2745">the values on the pixel colors, and more precisely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2752">can produce pixel colors that will be combined </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2752">with the rendered content. So let's look at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2759">how to use shaders step by step, so again, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2759">very simple, use a custom function, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2765">pass parameters to it. If we zoom in to what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2765">the parameters are, the only required parameter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2771">is the vertex shader. This is the only thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2771">that's required, so if you want to just pass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2777">the vertex shader, that's fine. There's an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2777">optional parameter which is a fragment shader </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2782">that will manipulate the pixel values, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2782">you specify the vertex mesh. The vertex mesh </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2788">is the granularity you want for, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2788">how many points you want to be able to manipulate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2793">that will be mapped on top of your rendering. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2793">Depending on the effect, you may want more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2796">or less of them. And then finally, and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2796">is very powerful, you can pass parameters </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2801">to vertex shaders, and those parameters can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2801">then be animated through CSS transitions and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2810">CSS animations, sorry. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2810">All right. So let's look at step by step, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2822">if I use only a vertex shader and the size </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2822">of the vertex mesh, here is how it looks, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2829">on the left-hand side is the thing I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2829">to filter. On top of it I've drawn the vortex </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2833">mesh or something that symbolizes the vertex </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2833">mesh. This little gray square represents the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2839">vertex mesh, so I've asked for a vertex mesh </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2839">that is two rows and two chums, so I have, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">you know, nine vertices to manipulate, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">now on the right-hand side you can see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2850">all of those vertices have been moved &mdash; have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2850">been moved by my vertex shader, and as a result, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2855">I get this distortion that gives the impression </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2855">that my element has been folded in two. Now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2863">what if I wanted to do something a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2863">more sophisticated and give it a little more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2867">realistic look, like if I wanted the thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2867">to be darker at the &mdash; you know, where the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2872">fold happens in the center, and just regular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2872">coloring on the edges. Well, that's when I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2880">would use &mdash; start using a fragment shader, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2880">so here I've added this fragment shader, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2886">what the fragment shader does is that it looks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2886">at the current core unit of the rendering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2891">and will produce a darker value in the center </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2891">and a lighter value on the edges, and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2896">gets combined with the rendering and provides </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2896">this very nice shading effect. And I mentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2905">earlier that passing parameter was &mdash; was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2905">a useful feature and a powerful feature in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2911">shaders, so here we have the same &mdash; the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2911">shaders we had in the previous example, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2917">one fold, and the vertex shader and the fragment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2917">shader, but I'm now passing a parameter that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2923">controls the amount of folding I do, and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2923">more I fold, the more &mdash; I mean, the bigger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2928">the amount, the bigger the effect, and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2928">bigger the shading in the center. So since </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2935">this can be, you know, manipulated through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2935">scripts, I have hooked up a little slider </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2939">here, and if I go to the left, I'll have less </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2939">of the effect, and you see what &mdash; how the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2943">code changes, and if I move to the right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2943">I'll go to the full extent of the &mdash; of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2949">effect. And there's no limit on which parameters </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2949">you pass and the type of parameters, the sophistication </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2955">offers a wide variety of parameters, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2955">pass, you know, matrices, colors, transforms, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2962">all kinds of things which can then be manipulated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2962">through CSS and scripts as well, so it's pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2967">powerful things, and this is a simple example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2967">but I'm hoping people will do real crazy things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2972">with the feature. I want to give a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2972">taste of what the code looks like. The syntax </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2982">and the language that's used for writing those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2982">little programs that will act on vertices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2986">or on pixel values, the language is GLSL, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2986">so it's the same language that is used in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2992">Web GL for when you write shaders for Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2992">GL. The vertex shader, at the end of the day, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2997">if you look at line 13, that is what a vertex </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2997">shader does. The main function of the shader, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3003">which starts on line 7, its whole role is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3003">to compute a GL position, and that's basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3011">how you want to displace the vertex that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3011">being processed, and it's called once for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3016">every vertex. So if you want to learn more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3016">about GLSL, you know, there are a lot of poll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3024">documentation on the Web for Web GL, but also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3024">for open GLES, because that is the same exact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3029">language. It's &mdash; you know, it's seal like. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3029">It's a little different. But it's not that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3034">hard, and there's lots of examples to start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3034">from. Fragment shaders or pixel shaders, similarly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3041">it's the same language as for GLSL. There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3041">a slight difference &mdash; actually not that slight. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3048">There's a difference with regular fragment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3048">shaders using Web GL or open GLES is the output </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3056">of the filter is not a GL frag color. If you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3056">a graphic expert, you're familiar with that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3061">value, which is the typical role of a fragment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3061">shader. In our case, and for security reasons, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3067">what we produce is a pixel value that is then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3067">combined with the rendered output. There has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3074">been a lot of work done on making shaders </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3074">secure, and the result of this was that with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3082">this modification we don't give access to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3082">the rendered content to shaders, and as a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3087">result they are safe, and they can still do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3087">all the, you know, the use cases that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3093">talked about so far. Now, we don't expect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3093">people to, you know, write as many shaders </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3100">as they will use shaders. We expect that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3100">you know, we'll have, for example, we plan </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3106">to provide shaders that people can start experimenting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3106">with. We expect that experts will write nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3113">shaders with a set of well documented parameters </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3113">that a lot of people can use, and one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3119">things we've started to think about is, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3119">how can we make it easy for people to configure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3123">a shader the way they want and make it look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3123">exactly right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3128">So this is what the CSS shader studio does, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3128">and I'll show you a few example of that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3133">of that tool. So here we're in this prototype </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3133">tool. It's not a &mdash; it's not an application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3141">or a tool that, you know, we would sell or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3141">anything. It's a demo tool. And on the left </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3148">hand side you have a set of shaders. When </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3148">you select one, you &mdash; the user interface </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3154">provides you the parameters that you can configure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3154">for the shader, so those are &mdash; if you remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3158">the syntax, the parameters you pass at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3158">end of the custom function. In the center </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3162">you see a prototype like rendering that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3162">affected by the shader, and at the bottom, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3167">there's a time line that lets you animate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3167">the different values for the shader. So, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3171">know, before the presentation I prepared one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3171">on the &mdash; this warp shelter we have, and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3178">set it up so that, you know, at time zero </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3178">I've set up the, you know, the warp the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3185">I wanted with this little UI that lets me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3185">move the vertices visually, and the end of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3192">the animation is restored to its state. Now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3192">if I run it, you know, I will have kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3197">a transition effect that &mdash; I may want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3197">put on my Web page when I'm shoring up UP's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3201">of information, for example. There's all kinds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3201">of different effects you could do. Scroll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3209">is one of my favorites. If I go back here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3209">I pre-define it, if I move the roll ratio, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3218">for example, I can do the effect I want, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3218">again if I run it, it's going to, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3225">show me a preview of this type of effect I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3225">might want. I can also do things like shuffling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3231">tiles for example. Here, where &mdash; when I move, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3231">I can &mdash; I can kind of explode the content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3242">and that's because when I move the vertices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3242">of the &mdash; you know, on the vertex mash, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3248">have the option of keeping them attached in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3248">which case it's like moving a &mdash; distorting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3252">a piece of rubber, but I have also the option </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3252">of having detached tiles or detached, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3260">know, tiles on the rendering. And if I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3260">many of them, I can have a nice protocol effect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3267">like we're seeing here. So the idea here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3267">to make it, you know, a visual experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3273">for, like you do when you're trying to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3273">a grayed-in, except it's a little more complicated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3277">in this case, and the tool will provide, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3277">know, the nice syntax that you can just cut </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3281">and paste into your CSS page, your CSS file, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3281">and if you want to do the animation effect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3288">itself, you can just grab it here, we export </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3288">the exact syntax that we need to go into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3295">CSS file again. So hopefully that type of, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3295">you know, visual tool will help. You know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3302">people start using the feature, and make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3302">painless, and visually interesting to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3308">them. So this tool is not yet available, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3308">we're planning to make it available later </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3313">this year so that people can &mdash; can look at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3313">it, and experiment with shaders easily. All </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3324">right. So another effect or visual effect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3324">that we're working on is around texturing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3332">and blending. So blending is something that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3332">very common in graphic packages, like Photoshop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3338">or GIMP. The idea of texturing is to control </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3338">how what you draw blends or mixes with where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3347">you draw, so you draw something, and you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3347">it to interact with the backdrop. So currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3353">we have opacity, so if I use opacity on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3353">menu like this, like at my "home, about, products" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3358">menu, I use opacity and I kind of see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3358">background behind, and that's nice, but it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3364">makes it a little washed out, and it's not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3364">quite what you want. It's not quite what graphic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3369">designers want, because they're used to those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3369">nice blend modes that they have in tools like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3373">Photoshop again. We're working on a new proposal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3373">&mdash; it's actually not that new proposal, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3380">a feature that has been in SVG for awhile, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3380">but it's now being brought to the larger CSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3385">and HTML, and it's CSS compositing and blending, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3385">and it can do things like this, so now what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3392">I've done is I've turned on blend mode, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3392">a (inaudible) mode, and the blue that I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3398">now interacts in a different way with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3398">background, and just to show that this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3403">not just images, you know, the way people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3403">do this kind of effect today on the Web is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3407">that design it in Photoshop, they export a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3407">bunch of images and then they put it on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3412">&mdash; on the page. Here I have the CSS animation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3412">on the color, and you can see that the color </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3418">animation happens and produces a new rendering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3418">for the menu item, and that gets blended in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3425">with the background. I didn't have to scrub </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3425">a thousand bit maps to do so. Using, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3433">blending and compositing is made with two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3433">properties. It's extremely simple. I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3438">two small demos. So what you see here in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3438">backdrop is what we're drawing on top of, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3444">and we're drawing this yellow bar on top of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3444">those three elements. The way you specify </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3449">it is very straightforward. You have an alpha </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3449">compositing property, and by default it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3453">source over, so a bit of a technical term; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3453">that just means draw what I draw on top of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3458">the background. And that's &mdash; you know, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3458">far that's no surprise. But I have a bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3463">of options and, you know, I can say I just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3463">want, you know &mdash; sorry. Destination over, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3469">for example, will draw what I'm drawing behind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3469">the backdrop. I can do source in, dust in. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3477">There's a bunch of different effects that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3477">you can use that will combine in different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3481">ways with the background, so that's the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3481">of two properties. The second one is blend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3489">mode, so again, if I'm trying to combine foreground </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3489">and a background in various ways, I just use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3495">a blend mode property, and by default it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3495">normal, meaning that the colors don't interact. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3502">But I can change it to something like plus, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3502">multiply, you know, color dodge or difference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3508">and have various effects, and those are exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3508">the ones that you would find in graphic packages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3512">today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3512">[ APPLAUSE ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3514"><span class="speakerName">Vincent Hardy</span>: Thank you. So, so far we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3514">proposed all this and worked with the community, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3527">the working groups in (inaudible) to bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3527">this to CSS. We're working on possibly contributing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3534">this or proposing this for canvas as well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3534">and we've done a prototype of this I'll show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3540">quickly. It's in &mdash; this is really blending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3540">edge prototype we've done in FireFox, nicely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3547">build in FireFox, and what you see is basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3547">the same concept in canvas. At the bottom </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3554">of the screen here, we have the &mdash; the code. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3554">I'm drawing two images, and the first one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3562">is the background, which is a visual canvas, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3562">then I change the compositing operation to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3567">be an overlay &mdash; sorry, a multiply mode, blend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3567">mode, and I then draw this kind of colorful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3575">graphics on top of it, and I get this better, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3575">nicer integration with my background, so this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3580">is something that's, you know, again (inaudible) </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3580">but we're considering offering this property </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3585">for different graphics model than canvas is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3585">All right, so, the things we talked about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3592">today is that the &mdash; you know, the world of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3592">the Web developers and of creators has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3600">intersecting, you know, there's been features, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3600">but there's not been that many of them in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3604">the past, and we're trying to increase that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3604">intersection between the two so that there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3609">a lot more happening on the Web and a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3609">more features available to developers, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3615">this is really the area we're focusing on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3615">now is, you know, trying to make this area </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3619">larger and try to provide more tools for this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3619">area, because we believe that if we do this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3627">we'll have a lot more exclusivity on the platform, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3627">meaning that you can express a lot more in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3632">the markup in your CSS, or your HTML, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3632">will make everybody more creative, and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3640">think there's an opportunity for a new generation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3640">of tools and new, you know, new ways of interacting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3646">between creators and developers. So thank </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3646">you very much for your attention. And if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3651">have questions, we are probably going to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3651">able to take one or two, but we can also talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3657">after the end of the sessions.
