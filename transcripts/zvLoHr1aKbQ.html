<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="0"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: We have a great panel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="0">today to help us answer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3">some of these questions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="4">First, Jessica Livingston. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="7">Jessica started in investment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">banking and then was a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">co-founder of Y Combinator, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">and has written a book &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">several books, I think &mdash; but the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">one that I read, "Founders </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">at Work." And Paul Graham, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">other founder of Y Combinator, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">made one of the best decisions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">in his life when he proposed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">to marry Jessica. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="32">So they're husband and wife. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="35">Next to Jessica, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">Naval Ravikant. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="37">Naval is the founder </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">of Angel List. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="41">I'm sure you all know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">about Angel List. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="43">But he's also an entrepreneur </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">before that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="45">He co-founded several companies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">before that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">Genoa, Epinions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="51">You probably have heard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">of Epinions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="54">And he's also a co-author </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">of "Venture Hacks." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">And next to Naval, Heidi Roizen, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">a longtime friend. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="67">Heidi is also an entrepreneur </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">and founder. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="70">She co-founded T/Maker </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">back in the PC era. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="75">And she was a venture capitalist </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">at SoftBank, one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">the hottest venture capital </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">firms at the time, and is now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">and she's also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">a lecturer at Stanford. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="90">So very accomplished panel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="92">So the way we run this, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">session is for you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="95">So there are two mics here, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">we want you to come up and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">ask questions throughout. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="101">So I'm going to start with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">some questions to get it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">going, but at any point, come up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">to the mic, I'll recognize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">you, and you can ask </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">your question. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="111">Typically, over half </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">of this session is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">questions from the audience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="116">So start thinking about your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="116">questions, line up at the mic, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">and we'll get as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">many as we can. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="122">I'll start with a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">questions here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="125">So Jessica, Y Combinator, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="125">the first and largest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="131">incubator ever. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="134">How many companies apply to Y </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">Combinator now, and how many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">do you accept? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">JESSICA LIVINGSTON: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">Can you hear me? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">Lately, like the last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">application process we had for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">the summer batch, I think we got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">about 2,500 applications, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">and this summer's batch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">is 52 startups. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="160"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: 52 out of 2,500. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="162"><span class="speakerName">Jessica Livingston</span>: Out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">of 2,500, yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="163"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So that's like 2%. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">JESSICA LIVINGSTON: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">It's pretty low. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="168"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">That's harder than Harvard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">to get into Y Combinator. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">Probably better, too. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">How do you decide which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="177">companies to accept? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="182"><span class="speakerName">Jessica Livingston</span>: Well we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">10-minute interviews, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">it's a big challenge to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">choose the startups. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="187">And for those of you who don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">know, we conduct the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">interviews back to back all day </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">long, and then we contact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">the founders that night to say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">whether we'd like to fund them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">or not, so they find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">out that very day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="200">So in the 10 minutes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="200">what do we do? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">We have three different tracks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">of Y Combinator partners doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">the interviews. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="209">So I'm in a room with Paul and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">Robert and Trevor, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">original founders, and they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="212">all technical. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="215">I'm not technical. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="217">And so I let them evaluate the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">technology and evaluate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">whether the founders are good at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">programming, which is very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">hard to tell. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="227">But you can sometimes base it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">on what they've built if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">they've built something already, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">or if they, in their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">application, have built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">something in the past, we take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">a long look at that in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">application process. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="240">What I am looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="240">specifically in interviews, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">sort of block out all the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">stuff and I'm looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">the co-founder dynamic and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">personalities of the founders. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="252">Have they thought deeply about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">what their startup idea, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">area that it's in? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">Do they seem excited about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">it, believe it or not? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">Do they get along? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">Are they interrupting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">each other? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">That's a bad sign. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="268">Different things like that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="269">It's sort of hard to describe. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="271">And then literally after the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">10 minutes, the four of us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">say, OK, should we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">fund them or not? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">And sometimes it's very clear </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">and we all say absolutely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">because we're excited about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">the idea and the people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="281">Sometimes we have to talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="281">it for a few minutes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">but it's never more than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">a few minutes. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="286"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So in 10 minutes, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">can decide whether this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">a company you're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">to invest in or not. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="291"><span class="speakerName">Jessica Livingston</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">It seems pretty crazy, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">sometimes we're wrong. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">But when we first started Y </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">Combinator in 2005, we had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">half an hour interviews. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">Of course, we were only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">interviewing 25 startups at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="304">that point. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">But we realized that we really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">did have a sense after the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">first few minutes and a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">of the time was wasted. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">So we make it 10 minutes so we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">can talk to more groups. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="314"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">So Heidi, you're in the venture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">capital business and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">you fund companies. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">How do you decide who to fund </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">and who not to fund? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="325"><span class="speakerName">Heidi Roizen</span>: Well, a lot of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="325">work gets done before we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">ever meet face to face because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">I think for every venture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">capital firm, there are areas </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">that we are knowledgeable in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">and there are areas we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">not knowledgeable in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="336">It doesn't make a lot of sense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">for us to try to make an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">investment in an area that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">don't know anything about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="340">I think that's pretty true </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">of most venture firms. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="342">They'll pick practice areas that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">they're interested in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="346">We look at a lot of deals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">that come in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="348">We get together every Monday, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">the partners, and we discuss </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">things that we've seen or things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">we've heard about. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="353">Obviously, we're batting things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">around on email a lot. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="356">If you think about when we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">in a partner meeting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">collectively among us, we sit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">on close to 100 boards, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">it's a very interesting group </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">of people because we're in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">there with about 100 company </span><span class="line" data-startTime="367">data points in real time in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">our heads, presuming we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">paying attention to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">companies we're actually already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">invested in, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">isn't always true of all VCs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="377">But we have a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">of data points. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="379">And so part of looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">funding &mdash; and by the way, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">was an entrepreneur. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="386">I spent six months on the road </span><span class="line" data-startTime="386">my first time out trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">raise money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="390">No one would fund us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="392">We self-funded, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">bootstrappped, and we funded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">in my very most favorite way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">be funded way, which is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">represented by any of us up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">here, which is we actually got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">customers to buy our product. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="403">It's this really cool way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">get funding because it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">non-dilutive and you learn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">something and it validates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="411">your business proposition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="412">So it's cool at many levels, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">and that's how we did it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="415">And so we only raised our first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">round six years after we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">started the company, and we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">already about $4 million </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">in revenue and profitable when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">we did, which really changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">your dynamics in terms of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">you can negotiate with. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="430">So I give you all that to say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">I've been on your side of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">table, and I've been on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="434">my side of the table. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="437">I've been on both sides the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="437">table and it is a relatively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="440">random process. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="441">So if you're sitting there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">thinking, this sounds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">ridiculous. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="445">How could you possibly make a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">decision in 10 minutes, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">I completely agree. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="449">We do the same thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="449">How could you read a one pager </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">and know whether you're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">to invest or not? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">I don't know. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="453">It's a pretty crazy system, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">but that's how the vast </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">majority of the venture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">capitalists I know do it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="458">It's a lot about gut and feel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">and pattern recognition and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">pattern and sensing something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">about the team and the mission </span><span class="line" data-startTime="464">they're on, and it's very hard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="464">to articulate, which is why </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">also venture is very much a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">small team, a business. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="473">It's also why you'll take 50 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">meetings and you'll get 50 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">different answers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="479">And when you ask VCs for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">feedback, you'll get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">diametrically opposed views, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">and that doesn't matter. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="487">You just go out and kiss </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">a bunch of frogs, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">eventually, you will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">find one, I think. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="491">If you believe in your idea and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">you've got a good idea, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">you will find one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="494">But it is a lengthy process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">and don't think that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">people on the other side of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">table from you have some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">magic thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="500">And I'll just close </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">by saying this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="501">I know some VCs who've tried </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">over time to quantify this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="506">In fact, I know this big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">initiative going on that one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">person's doing who's super smart </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">and is trying to do this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">thing about, if you have these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">degrees from these places and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">you worked at these places, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">in fact, if you dropped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">out before you finish &mdash; because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">that's the current </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">lore is it's better to drop out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">from Harvard or Stanford </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">than it is to actually finish </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">in any one of those places. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="525">So he's actually trying to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">this analysis and say, can I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">figure out which ones </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">are going to be the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">best based on analysis? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">And just so far, every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">one of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">initiatives has largely failed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="538">So it really is all about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">reading, being able to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">your point across well enough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">that you intrigue someone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">enough to take that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">first meeting. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="545">It's not about getting all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">way to the finish line. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="547">It's about intriguing us enough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="547">so we'll take the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">meeting, and then it's about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">knowing how to make that 10 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">minutes really count. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="553"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">We have questions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">in the audience. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="556">Let's start here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="557"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Hi. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="557">It's a great panel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="559">I was recently at a meeting of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">VCs where I met somebody who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">sort of criticized the idea of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">all these different startup </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">incubators coming up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="570">He though, well, they're forced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">into a three-month </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">program, and at the end of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">time, they have to show that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">they're on a hockey stick sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">of curve in terms of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">revenue, and if they don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">do it, then that's it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="584">You don't really get anywhere. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="585">So his criticism was that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">these incubators force </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">businesses to sort of develop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">a certain way, and he didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">think that was good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="595">So I was wondering what your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="595">thoughts are on the whole idea </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">of all these different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">incubators </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">coming up in general. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="602"><span class="speakerName">Jessica Livingston</span>: I assume </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">that's for me. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="604">Well, when we started Y </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">Combinator, I can promise you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">we did not expect there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">to be so many people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">doing what we do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="611">So I don't know. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="612">I don't really have a comment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">on if it's good or bad. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="616">But in terms of our startups, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">over this three month period, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">we're working very closely with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">them to help prepare them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">for Demo Day, which is when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">there's a room filled with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">investors, 400 investors, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">come and see their two and a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">half minute pitches. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="632">And again, the goal is to just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">create an interest and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">hopefully get a meeting. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="638">And we think that that's a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">idea because it's such </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">an efficient way for investors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">to spend a couple hours of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">their time and see 40 or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">50 companies at once. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="649">It's great if there's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">hockey stick curve. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="652">It's great if after three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">months, you have this major </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">growth rate because investors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">love that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="657">But it's certainly not true </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">for everyone, and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">certainly not true that every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">single startup raises tons of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">money right after Demo Day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="666">Some of them raise Series A, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">some of them raise a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">hundred thousand dollars and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">get back to working on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">product, and then six months </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">to a year later, we'll help </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">them go out and they'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">raise funding then. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="680"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: So do you think having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">all these incubators is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">a good thing? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="685"><span class="speakerName">Naval Ravikant</span>: So the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="685">accelerators are there &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">I actually don't like calling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="686">them incubators, so I'm just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">going to switch the terminology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">if someone doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">mind, because they're not really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">incubating little eggs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">and hatching them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="693">I just find that's like a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">demeaning nomenclature. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="696">The accelerators serve three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">incredibly important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">functions, just like schools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">do, just like MIT does or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">Harvard does. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="702">One is they filter. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="703">So they help go through all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">noise and say, these are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">the people worth looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">before they might have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">product or before they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">might have traction. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="709">So that 10 minute interview </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">that Jessica and Paul and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">Robert and Trevor do, people pay </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">enormous amounts of money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">for the output from those 10 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">minute interviews, so that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">very important function. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="718">The second thing that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="718">accelerators do is they do the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="720">education function. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="721">Part of that might be, look, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">here's how you raise money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="723">That's kind of an obvious </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">question people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">are going to ask. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="725">And the third thing they do is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="725">they build an incredible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="727">alumni network that pulls </span><span class="line" data-startTime="727">resources, educates the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">entrepreneurs, unionizes their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">power a little bit, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">standardizes the things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">they might have had to do one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">off or ad hoc. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="735">So these are very valuable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">functions, and without the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">accelerators today, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">I don't think the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="740">angels could function. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="741">There would be too may deals out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">there to look at, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">wouldn't know what to look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">at and what not to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="744">And without the angels out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">there, I don't think the VCs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">could function. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="747">The VCs are using the angels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">for signals, and the angels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">are using the accelerators </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">for signals. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="752">So like it or not, they're a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">part of the ecosystem that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">here to stay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="755">But just like there are lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">angels and there are good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">ones and bad ones, and just like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">there are lots of VCs and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">there are successful ones and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">failed ones, there are lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">accelerators, and there's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">cream of the crop, and there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">the not so good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="765">So they're an important part of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">infrastructure that's not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">going away. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="769">I would say that today, probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">half of the companies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">that we feature on Angel List </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">have come through some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="775">accelerator or another, and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="775">count that signal in as to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="779">which accelerator they came </span><span class="line" data-startTime="779">from and who they got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">associated from that accelerator </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">and what kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">financing they did afterwards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">as an input signal. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="787">Everyone in this business is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="787">looking at tons of noise and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">trying to extract signals. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="791">And it is through that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">pattern matching. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="793">And to the point earlier, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="793">cannot systematize that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="796">You can't automate it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="799">Think about the combinatorics </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">of human DNA. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="801">There's six billion, seven </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">billion people on this planet. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="803">No two are even vaguely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="803">similar if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">you get to know them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="806">And companies at this stage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">are just combinations of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">individuals, so they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">even more unique. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="811">So you need all these human </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">filters who are constantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">quickly assessing everyone to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">figure out who gets to make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">to the next stage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="817">Like it or not, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">the way it works. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="819"><span class="speakerName">Heidi Roizen</span>: I want to add one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="819">thing because I've heard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="820">that same thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="822">If you tell people that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">have to solve a problem with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">three months and $50,000, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">only going to solve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">easy problems, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">the complaint. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="831">And number one, I'm a huge fan </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">of accelerators and of angel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="836">financing because I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="836">that they do fill &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">yes, there are problems you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">actually solve in three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">months with $50,000, but there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">are also problems you can kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">of take your first whack at it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">with three months and $50,000 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">and show progression, even if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">it's not user metrics because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">you don't get there. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="853">At the other end of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">spectrum, there are things, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="854">like I know Singularity is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="854">trying to mount something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">where they're trying to solve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">really big problems. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="858">They're trying to stake out the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">area where they say, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="861">actually going to be the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="861">accelerator that solves really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">big problems that take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">a long time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="865">The problem with really big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">problems that take a long time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="867">is the funding mechanisms of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="867">both, I think accelerators and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">angel investors, they're not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">life cycle financing for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">really big problems, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">why you have a whole food </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">chain of people, including </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">venture capitalists, all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">way up through investment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">bankers and ultimately the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">public markets &mdash; which there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">are periods of time where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">public markets actually allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">non-profitable companies to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">public, which is another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">way of getting funding. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="896">So I think there's that whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="896">food chain there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="898">I think you have to know &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">and this is a really important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">thing for everybody, not just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="902">for accelerator or angels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="902">or whatever &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">you have to know what you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">trying to do and what kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="908">financing is appropriate for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="908">you, because you can bang your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">head against the wall all day </span><span class="line" data-startTime="911">going to people who are just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">the wrong people to fund you. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="915">And people often will take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="915">meetings, especially if you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">got something interesting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="917">because they like to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">educated, and you do not want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">to spend all your time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="922">educating the population. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="924">So it's important to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">understand that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="926">I do want to say there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="926">a really great book. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="930">It is about venture financing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">but it also covers the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="934">areas, by these two guys, Brad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="934">Feld and Jason Mendelson, who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="938">are partners at Foundry Group, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="938">and it's called "Venture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">Deals, How to be Smarter Than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">Your Venture Capitalist," or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">something like that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="943">And actually, it does a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">nice job laying out the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">landscape of financing and how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">financing works, which I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="950">is super critical. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="951">If you're going to take money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="951">from anyone, you should know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">what the whole end to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">end life cycle looks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="955">like for outside capital. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">And I would say 10 years ago, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1101">was nearly impossible, with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">the occasional exception, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">to raise money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">outside of Silicon Valley. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1108">That's changing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1109">So now it's probably about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1109">half the activity is in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">Silicon Valley and maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">half is spread out over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1114">the rest of the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1115">So that's a lot better than it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">used to be, and that's thanks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">to the internet, that great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">equalizer that brings us all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">here today. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1144"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: No. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">You talked about all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">challenges for the startups in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1146">the YC class last year. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1152"><span class="speakerName">Jessica Livingston</span>: Yeah, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">[? Mino ?] monsters? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1153"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: It doesn't matter. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">So my question is for you, one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">of the challenges for all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1163">people who want to start up here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1163">is a lot of us are on H1B </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">visa, and I know a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">of talented people. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">They are very highly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1170">motivated. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">But because of the constraints </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1174">of the startup visa, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">cannot go out and start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">their own company. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1179">So I want to know, how does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1179">the startup community in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">Silicon Valley deal with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">this, and how much the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">progress are we making? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">And if we cannot make any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">progress in the short term, do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">you have any advice for anyone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">on H1B visa but want to go out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1198">and start their own company? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">So </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1200"><span class="speakerName">Jessica Livingston</span>: Just so I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1200">make sure I understand your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1201">question, it has to do with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1201">immigration rules and how hard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">it is to come here and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">start a startup? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1207">I know a lot of people care very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1207">much about this topic. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1211"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: And how do we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">make progress on this? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1257"><span class="speakerName">Jessica Livingston</span>: They can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1257">start a startup because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">you're on an H1B? </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">He stopped working for money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">about 40 years ago. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1697">He does not need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1697">any more money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1699">But no one works harder than he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1699">does because he just loves </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1702">what he does, and most investors </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1702">are like that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1750"><span class="speakerName">Naval Ravikant</span>: It's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1750">super hard problem. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1753">There are regulatory issues, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1753">that's just one of many, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1755">many, many issues. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1756">Probably the biggest one is just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">at a very early stage, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">investing is a people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">business. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1760">And so you don't know the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1760">people, you don't know the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">network, you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">know the culture. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1764">You don't even know what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">you don't know. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1766">So it's very difficult to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1766">invest in an early stage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">startup that's overseas. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1769">At Angel List, we do a bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">of overseas matching &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">in fact, that's where I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">we add the most value &mdash; but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1776">generally, those companies need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1776">to have a fair bit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">traction because that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">what it takes to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">pull a remote investor. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1781">And even then, it's pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1781">rare and difficult. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1784">So surprisingly to me, the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1784">that most international </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">companies get funded these days </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1787">is they actually move to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1791">here, which seems backwards. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1793">But actually, there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1793">accelerators that do nothing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">but cream skim and import </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">from entire countries. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1798">And it's a very valuable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1798">service, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">that's what they do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1800">UpWest West does it from Israel, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">and Startmate does it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1802">from Australia, and there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1802">a Korean one, a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">Japanese one, and so on. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1886"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Software. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1887">But we need servers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1887">and everything. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1890">We can't afford it if people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1890">start to use it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">So how can we get funding before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">launching the project? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1899"><span class="speakerName">Naval Ravikant</span>: I mean, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">the obvious thing is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1901">just launch it anyway. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1903">Come on, what? $250 Hiroku </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">server or AWS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1907">Just get something up there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1908">At least then you can start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1908">talking to investors and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1910">accelerators and people who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1910">might be able to help you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1912">the next step. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1913">And there are accelerators </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1913">in Canada. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1915">You can apply to YC from there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1915">as well, and maybe get down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1917">here for an interview. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1919">Drive across country </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1919">if you had to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1920">What was it, Brian Chesky, sell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1920">cereal if you have to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1924">JESSICA LIVINGSTON: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">Sell cereal boxes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1928">Sorry to interrupt you, Naval, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1928">but you brought up and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1931">sort of a funny story. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1932">But certainly, you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1932">apply to Y Combinator. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">If you can't do that, I've seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">lots of variations on how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1939">to bootstrap. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1940">I mean, if you can't charge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1940">customers, the story from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">Airbnb is that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">were destitute. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1946">They could not pay for anything, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1946">and they were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1949">designers from RISD. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1950">So it was around the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1950">presidential campaign here and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">they thought, OK, let's design </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1952">these kooky cereal boxes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1957">And they had Captain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1957">McCain cereal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1959">that was Captain Crunch. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1961">Hopefully, you know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">what that is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1962">And Obama Os that were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">a take on Cheerios. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1966">And they said, gosh, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1966">let's see. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1967">We'll make them a limited </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1967">edition and sell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1970">them for $40 each. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1972">And they made thousands and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">thousands of dollars, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1975">that's not only how they paid </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1975">their rent, but they actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1978">wound up eating the cereal when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1978">they couldn't afford to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1980">go grocery shopping. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1984"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: The other answer is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1984">the natural progression of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">funding is your first money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">comes from friends and family. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">So the first $10,000 or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">first $50,000 comes from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1994">friends and family, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1994">that gets you far </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1996">enough to get it launched. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">And then your second money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1998">comes from angels, former </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">entrepreneurs or angel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">investors or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2003">that kind of thing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2004">And it's only after that that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2004">VCs will actually get involved </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">and give you even more money, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">so start there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2010"><span class="speakerName">Heidi Roizen</span>: But I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2010">to jump in on that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2012">First of all, don't take any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2012">money from people who cannot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2014">afford to lose it because as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2014">much as you love it and as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">much as your parents love you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">or whatever, if people give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2020">you money that they can't afford </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2020">to lose and you lose </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2022">it, I just think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2022">a bad way to live. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2025">So number one, that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2026">Number two, it's funny. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2030">With all due respect to what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2030">you just said, you're not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">technical, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2034">My undergraduate degree was in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2034">creative writing, so there is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2037">a future in technology even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2037">for people who don't code. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">I did code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2041">Nobody would want to buy my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">code, but all you guys who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2043">code and women who can code, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2043">need people like us to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2046">all that other stuff you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2046">don't want to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2047">So there's a future, even for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2047">those of us who don't. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2051"><span class="speakerName">Naval Ravikant</span>: To clarify, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2051">my point was you should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2053">understand the technology. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2054">I don't write the code for Angel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2054">List, but I at least </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2056">know a little bit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2056">what's going on. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2058"><span class="speakerName">Heidi Roizen</span>: And after this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2058">many years in this business, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">know a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">about it, too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2062">But I will say this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2064">I'm not a technologist, but I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2064">know some really simple math </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2067">about companies and ownership, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2067">and there's only ever 100%. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2071">It never changes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2072">You can't change it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2073">You can make the percentages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2073">worth more, but you can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2077">create more. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2078">So be very careful about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2078">taking money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2080">on by selling equity. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2082">If you do that, you are diluting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">your company, you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2085">setting up expectations, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2085">are putting people in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2088">situation of needing you to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2088">liquidity so that they can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2091">sell the company or take it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2091">public or whatever, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2094">have limited time frames of how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2094">long they're going to wait </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2098">to get that money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2099">So I just say that to say, try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2099">to think about raising money </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">and imagining that none of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">our categories existed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2106">And before our categories </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">existed &mdash; because even venture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2109">is a relatively new thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2112">I mean, it certainly wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">around 100 years ago. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2115">People made money these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2115">kinds of ways. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">They did consulting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2119">They did other products. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2120">They worked on nights </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2120">and weekends. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2123">They stole from their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2123">employers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2124">I'm not recommending that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">clearly, but I'm just saying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2127">there's all sorts of ways </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2127">that people get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">companies off the ground. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2132">And unfortunately, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">what's happened, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">particularly here in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">Silicon Valley &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2136">I think it's one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2136">downsides of being here with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2138">all the positive things, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2138">everybody thinks the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">thing you do here is you get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">money from other people and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2144">you sell equity to do it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2145">And I would argue that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2145">actually not the greatest way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">to start a company, and I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">look at all these other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2149">ways to do it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2151"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: OK. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">We have four minutes left. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2152"><span class="speakerName">Naval Ravikant</span>: Email me. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2153">You can guess my email. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2154"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: OK. thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2155"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: We have four minutes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2155">left so we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2157">go into the lightning round. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">That means you ask the question </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">15 seconds, and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2162">answer in about 30 seconds. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2164">Go ahead. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2165"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: So my question is for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">Jessica and Y Combinator. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">I know last year, you announced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">that you would be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">accepting applicants from people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">who didn't even have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2172">idea for a startup yet. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2175">Was that successful? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2176">What are you looking for in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2176">people who have no idea? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2179">And what have you learned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2179">from the process? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2183"><span class="speakerName">Jessica Livingston</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2183">That was called the No Idea </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2183">Track, and we thought, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2187">a lot of smart, talented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2187">people out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2189">We should let them apply even if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2189">they don't have an idea and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2192">we can help them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2193">It wasn't the best experiment, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">to be honest. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2198">But that said, we funded a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2198">of people who we didn't like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2202">the idea that they applied with, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2202">and we've worked with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2204">them, and they have new ideas. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">So we'll continue to fund people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">without ideas, I think. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2211"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Awesome. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2212">Next. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2251"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: You need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">to ask a question. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2254"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Don't you think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2254">there's something wrong with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2258">the funding model here? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2259">Don't you think you probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2259">need to scale it beyond the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2264">shores of America because there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2264">are people there who do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">not have the expertise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">but have the money. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">They want to know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">how to invest. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">I've been on both sides </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">of the table myself. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2272">I've lost money. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2273">I've also been an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2273">entrepreneur. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">So what we do not have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">there is knowledge. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2277">Don't you think that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2277">model should be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2279">scaled beyond the US? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2284"><span class="speakerName">Heidi Roizen</span>: Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2285">I mean, I think it should. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2286">But I think the point is if we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2286">don't do it, it's because our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2291">model is working here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2292">And I would argue that there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2292">actually a fair number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">ideas here, and part of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2294">reason is because all of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2296">are here in this room. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2297">So just look around the room </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2297">and understand you all did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2300">something to get here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2301">So this model is working for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2301">this, but I think the model </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2304">needs to be more distributed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2304">and it will over time, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2307">people will change that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2308">You've got to find the right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">people to change it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2310"><span class="speakerName">Naval Ravikant</span>: Think of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2310">it as an ecosystem. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2312">People are funding the animals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2312">within the ecosystem to find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2315">the things to eat. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">If the ecosystem isn't there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">you can't fund the animals. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">You can't fund the fish </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">in the desert. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2322">We have to build the ecosystem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2322">too, and that takes time. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2350"><span class="speakerName">Heidi Roizen</span>: Never sign up for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2350">anything that's perpetual, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2354">I mean that doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2354">have an end. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2355">So I mean, things that I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2355">you can consider doing, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2358">example, do a white label </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2358">version of the product for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2361">customer that is going to &mdash; let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2361">them exploit it all they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2364">want, but don't give them rights </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2364">to future development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2367">and don't give them rights to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2367">resell it to other people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2370">One of these we did early on to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2370">bootstrap our company is we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2373">realized that we could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2373">handle two byte code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2375">I know this is really ancient </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2375">history, I'm sorry. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2377">Back in the '80s, CPM day, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2377">anybody remember that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2381">And our biggest competitor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2381">could not. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2383">So even though they were much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2383">bigger than we, we went over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">to Taiwan, Japan, Korea. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2387">We went places where two byte </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2387">code mattered and we did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2390">basically countrywide site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2390">licenses because we could sell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2394">to one OEM and we could bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2394">in a couple hundred thousand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2397">dollars and that could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2397">fund the company. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2398">We said, what are the chances </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2398">we're actually going to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2400">over to Korea in any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2400">near term and be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2403">selling directly to consumers? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2404">It was like zero. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2406">But everything should have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2406">end because someday, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2408">going to want to sell your whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2408">company and you need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2410">be able to own the rights to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2410">core of what you're doing. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2413">Because I've also seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2413">developers do this where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">they'll say, fund me and I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">give you a 10% royalty for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2418">rest of my life on the product, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2418">and they create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2421">unfundable companies. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2423"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: All right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2423">last question right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2424">here in the red shirt. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2425"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Hi. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2425">My name is [INAUDIBLE]. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">I'm from New York. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">So you mentioned about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">college dropouts. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2430">So I'm working with two lovely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2430">ladies who are professors from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2434">New York and they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2434">past their 40s. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2436">So what do you think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2436">age and startups and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2441">collision, because so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2441">far, it's targeting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2443">the 20 years old. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2446"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So age, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2446">does that matter? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2451"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Yeah two co-founders </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2451">in their 50s, not dropouts. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2455"><span class="speakerName">Heidi Roizen</span>: Neither </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">young nor old. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2459">I mean, there could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2459">be brilliant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2461">people who are young. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2462">If anything, I think the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2462">problem around here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2463">everybody thinks if you're too </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2463">old, you must not have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2466">anything good you can do. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2468">I think that there are some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2468">generational differences and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2472">age doesn't matter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2472">to me at all. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2474">It's about what you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2474">know how to do. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2476"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: They are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2476">not as agile. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2477">They cannot move. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2479">They have other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2479">responsibilities. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2480">But OK. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2483"><span class="speakerName">Naval Ravikant</span>: I would give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2483">them every bit of success, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2485">perceived or actual, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2485">five years back. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2489"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: All right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2489">I'm sorry, we have to end. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2490">We're out of time. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2491">But thank you all very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2491">much for coming. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2493">[APPLAUSE] </span></p>
