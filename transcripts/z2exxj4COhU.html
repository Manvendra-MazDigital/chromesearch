<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2"><span class="speakerName">Alex Faaborg</span>: All right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3">Welcome and Good Morning. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3">Thanks for coming. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="4">I'm Alex Faaborg. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="5">I'm a designer at Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="7">My background's in cognitive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="7">science and machine learning. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="9">And at Google, I've worked on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">Google Now and on Glass and on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">the Android platform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="13">And giving design talks at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">venues like I/O is really one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">of the favorite parts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">of my job. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="18">I really enjoy doing it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="18">especially being able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="21">talked audience of engineers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="22">You guys are obviously smarter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">than most people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="24">It means I can move </span><span class="line" data-startTime="24">very quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="26">There's a lot of slides </span><span class="line" data-startTime="26">in this talk. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="27">So we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">have to dive in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="29">So how many of you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">are engineers? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">Quick hands. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="31">Yep. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="31">All of you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="33">Awesome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="34">Makes sense. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="34">It's a tech conference. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="35">So you write great software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="38">You make sure that your software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">executes well or is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">interpreted well on a silicon </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">based processor. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="45">But that's really the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">first time that your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">code is going to run. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="47">It's going to run it again </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">on another machine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="49">So you start with the mechanical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">computation, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">is of this entire conference is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">about and is very important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="54">But then there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">another phase. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="55">And that's the biological </span><span class="line" data-startTime="55">computation that's happening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">right after. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="58">And this is really where your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">code is actually being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">interpreted, is on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">the user's mind. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="63">So the more you can understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">about both of these machines, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">the better software that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">you're going to write. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="68">And it's important to focus on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">some of the attributes of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">we know about biological </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">computation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="73">So a very quick overview </span><span class="line" data-startTime="73">of the talk. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="74">Here's my very rough diagram. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="76">We're going to spend about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">half the talk on vision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="78">And then the second half the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="78">talk we'll be focusing on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="80">attention emotion memory. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="83">Diving into vision &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">During the opening sequence </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">we went through a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">lot of optical illusions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="87">Of course, no cognitive science </span><span class="line" data-startTime="87">talk is complete </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">without a few optical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">illusions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="91">This one is physiological. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="93">We're basically overloading your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">rods, where the little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">white dots are popping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">and becoming black. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="98">So this is basically just pure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="98">hacking of hardware. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="101">But what's more interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">is this one. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="103">This one is not physiological. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="104">This one's running on software, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">where the lines </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">appear to be slanted. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="108">They're not. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="108">They're horizontal. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="110">But nonetheless, your mind is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">interpreting it because the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">very powerful video codec that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">you have that's grabbing all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">this raw data is trying to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">certain optimizations based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">off of expected input in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">types of things you see in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">real world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="121">Another example is this one, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="121">where it really looks like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">there's a gradient on the bar. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="126">The bar's a flat color. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="127">The gradient's only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">in the background. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="129">And the reason for this effect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">is what we're used to natural </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">lighting environments. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="133">We're not used to this thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">being able to happen, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">you can have a flat color </span><span class="line" data-startTime="136">and a gradient into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">background. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="140">So all of our evolution has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">optimized for the types </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">of things that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">likely to see. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="145">So it's taking short cuts. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="147">It's increasing the amount of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">difference that you can very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">quickly see the edges </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">and changes in shape </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">and changes in shape. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="156">So one of things we're great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">at is edge detection. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="158">This is actually my favorite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">optical illusions. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="160">It's called the Kansai </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">Triangle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="161">And what's cool about this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">is there's isn't actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">triangle in the shot. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="165">But you perceive a right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">triangle in the foreground. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="168">It's being created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">out of nothing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="170">And when you look at the edges, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">you almost feel like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">you can see the shadow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">on the edge, even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">though it's not there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="178">Your mind is making assumptions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">on the triangle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">being in the foreground. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="182">And that edge doesn't exist but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">nonetheless you feel like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">you can see the shadow, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">which is very strange. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="187">So a lot of other cognitive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">scientists and designers, many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">years ago, came up with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="190">Gestalt Laws of Grouping. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="193">And this is something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">that all designers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">will learn in school. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="196">And there's eight of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">them for grouping. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="198">We only a little bit of time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">so we'll go through three of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">them specifically. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="202">First one's the Law </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">of Proximity. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="204">By introducing white space, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">perceive columns, instead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">of just the same number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">of shapes. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="209">When it's uniform grade, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">just perceive all the shapes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="211">But as soon as you have a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">bit of white space &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">your mind is very good at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">finding patterns and assigning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">order to things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="216">So you very quickly assign </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">that into three columns. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="219">So you don't have to draw boxes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">around everything to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">create grouping. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="221">You can just use a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="221">bit of white space. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="224">So an obvious example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">of this &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="225">Google search results. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="227">By introducing just a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">of white space in between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">the search results, it's very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="229">easy for people to group those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">and chunk them into individual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">results. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="233">Whereas if that white space </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">didn't exist, even though you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="235">have all the formatting cues &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">bold titles and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">blue underlines. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="240">Those things still exist. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="241">But it's still very hard to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">able to see that structure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">without the white space. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="245">Obvious analogy to writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">software is trying to look at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">code without white </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">space is hard. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="249">I mean, a computer can interpret </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">it just fine. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="252">In fact, white space is probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="252">wasting a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="253">of bandwidth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="254">But nonetheless for you as a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">developer, you need that to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">see the structure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="261">Another Gestalt Law of Grouping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">is the Law of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">Closure, where we very quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">complete forms. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="268">It's not actually full circle or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="268">full square, but we quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">make it one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="271">So again, you don't have to draw </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">boxes around everything. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="275">In the case of Android, just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="275">having the little edges on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">text field is enough for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">your mind to mentally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">complete the box. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="280">You begin to see the box. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="282">And the box exists in your mind, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="282">even though it wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">literally drawn on the screen. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="287">Law of Similarity &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">here, instead of columns, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">we're seeing row. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="290">And the only thing we changed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">was level of contrast of some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">of the objects. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="293">But the rows pop out. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="295">And it doesn't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="295">to contrast. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="296">It could also be shape, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">where seeing stars </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">versus circles, where &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">the rows really pop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">out at you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="303">And we this in Gmail, where &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">in this case, columns. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="306">You have a column of check boxes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">and column of starring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">messages and a column of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">priority, where it's very easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">to then visually scan down that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">column, even though the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">spacing is all uniform. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="315">It's otherwise just a grid. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="317">So those are all things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">that are innate, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">that apply to everyone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="321">There's also some aspects of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">layout that are cultural, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">you pick up over time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="326">One of the most basic one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">these is reading right to left </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">versus left to right. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="331">This is very important for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="331">structure of your application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="333">It's not just about the text, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">but it's about the logical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">flow of the application, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">the meaning of a switch being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">on versus off should actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="338">be inverted, if it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">horizontal switch. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="343">I should note &mdash; the back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">button is wrong. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="346">As I was a taking the screen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">shot, I realize this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="348">We'll fix that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="350">But the notion of back is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">opposite, if you're used to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">reading right to left, instead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="353">of left to right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="355">And this applies to really know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">the whole structure of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">your application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="359">And things like going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">up in the hierarchy. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="360">In the action bar, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">we see that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="362">We didn't do that correctly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="363">Or even things like the Settings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="363">button being sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">peripheral to activating a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">keyboard in this sense &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="369">there's a certain flow to it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="370">And that flow should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">be reversed. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="373">So a whole new topic related to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">vision &mdash; peripheral vision. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="376">Let's say we have an underground </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">testing facility, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">where we do studies on people, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">of course for science. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="383">And we keep people isolated. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="385">So we don't about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">the studies are. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="385">So they don't know any idea what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">the study is going in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="388">But we give you this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">test chamber. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="390">And we ask you to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">into the room. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="392">So you go in. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="393">And bam &mdash; tiger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="396">That's the only test. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="397">Basically, we're just monitoring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="397">how long it takes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">you to realize that there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="400">a tiger in front of you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="402">And it's going to be about 190 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="402">milliseconds to recognize that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">tiger that we very carefully </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">set on the podium. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="408">It's probably hard to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">him to stay there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="409">And of course, he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">then kills you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="410">But that's not part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">of the test. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="412">That part's arbitrary. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="413">And it's up to the tiger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="415">So let's run another study. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="418">At this point, subjects are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">kind of talking, say these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">chamber's are no good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="422">So you go in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="423">There's nothing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="424">Once again, bam &mdash; tiger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="427">And what's interesting about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">this is you'll see this tiger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">in 80 milliseconds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="432">We've actually evolved to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">faster peripheral vision for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">detecting motion in objects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">because of tigers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="438">There's a very legitimate for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">this is all the people who had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">vision that was uniform, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">between central and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">peripheral, they'll get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">killed by tigers and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">the rest of us survived. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="448">And we're very good at seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">movement and change in our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">peripheral vision. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="452">It's highly tuned for that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="454">So what's this have to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">with interface design? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">Obviously, we don't exist in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">environments where we have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">lot of predators anymore. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="459">We're all information workers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="461">But nonetheless, you can use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">this in your design. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="463">So let's say that I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">modifying this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">product-to-plan document. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="467">And then my PM shows up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="469">And this is his actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">at avatar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">picture up in the corner &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">of the tiger, tying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">it all together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="475">And what's interesting about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">this is it's actually easier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">for me to see that notification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">of him arriving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">in the document, when that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">being cued off of my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">peripheral vision, verses if it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">happened right in front of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">me as an editing text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="484">and things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="485">So that same effect of grabbing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">the user's attention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">of notification &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">it's actually easier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">in their periphery. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="492">So another new topic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">related to vision &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">geons and object recognition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="496">So we recognize a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">objects in the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="499">We're constantly encountering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">new objects. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="501">There's millions, potentially </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">billions of them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="504">So the question is how do we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">actually store all of this in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="507">our own software? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">And this is some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">most recent research. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="510">The idea is that we have a core </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">vocabulary geometric objects. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="514">And people argue about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">the exact number </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">of how many it is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="518">But people are gravitating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">towards there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">maybe being 24 of them. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="522">And even just 24 &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">any three of them, you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">create greater than 306 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">billion combinations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="527">So that's robust enough that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">it could be working. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="529">But basically the idea is when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">you look at an object, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">immediately break it down into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="531">the geons that it contains. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="534">And then you use that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">to do the look up of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">which object it is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="537">So here you got cylinder </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">and the curved candle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="539">You do that look up and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">say, oh, it's a cup. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="541">And this applies to even more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">complicated objects, where, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">you're perceiving it, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">constantly just breaking it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">down into the various core </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">geometric objects and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">using that for recognition. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="550">So what's interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">about this &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">not exactly tigers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="552">But you will recognize the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">silhouette, the basic geometry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">of the shape, faster than you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">recognize an icon that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">is more photo-realistic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">or rendered. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="563">Now it's a very small </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">difference. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="565">So you might have been able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">to perceive it as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">you're watching yourself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="568">But nonetheless it's kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">interesting that, if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">really care about speed and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">subtlety and having a truly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">optimized design, these sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">silhouette, basic geometry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">shapes actually do recognize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">faster for the user. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="580">And this is also &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">there's a lot of aesthetic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">reasons why you might want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">use one versus the other. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="586">For instance, on the Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="586">home screen, where we can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">control the background, we opt </span><span class="line" data-startTime="588">for using the more rendered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">icons because they have better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">contrast on variety of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">backgrounds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="594">But also on Android, the hollow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">icon set is entirely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">this flat icon style, in part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="597">due to aesthetics and also in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="601">part due to this recognition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="603">So you can very quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="603">spot things in here &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">camera or joystick or battery. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="608">As soon as you see these things, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">you very immediately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">know what they are. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="612">So another type of object </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">recognition we do is facial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">recognition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="614">And this is actually done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">on a completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">separate hardware path. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="618">You're not looking at someone's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="618">face and breaking it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">down into various geometric </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">objects. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="621">You have an entirely separate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">set of hardware in your mind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">that's purely dedicated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">recognizing faces. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="627">So let's take you into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">another test chamber. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="630">At this point, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">really worried. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="632">And you go in, and you think, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">oh my god, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">full stock-art people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="637">And they're all walking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">towards me &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">even worse than tigers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="640">And in this test, it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">all stock-art people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="643">And they're kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">creepy perfection. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="646">But there's one person and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="646">who's actually a friend. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="649">And the test is how quickly do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">you see your friend as all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">these people walk towards you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="652">And you'll see them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">very quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="654">You've probably have already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="654">about perceived this at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">conference, where various people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">conference &mdash; you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">seeing a lot of cases, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">obviously. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="659">But you'll quickly spot these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">people that you know. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="661">You might not remember their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">name, which is a whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">different thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="664">But you'll definitely know that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">you recognize them as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="667">someone that you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="667">met before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="669">And you're able to do this by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">taking in all the faces </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">simultaneously, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">also very interesting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="673">You're not having to do a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">linear scan between each face </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">to process it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="677">This is all just happening in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="677">the background, on the full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">visual field. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="681">So in terms of implications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">for interface design &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">if you're looking to see a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">particular email came in from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="687">say James or Ruth, with this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="687">type of design you're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">have to do when your scan </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">down the list and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="692">read each of the names. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="693">But if we start using faces, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">then you can get that effect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">of all the hardware that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">we had built for facial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">recognition. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="699">So for instance, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">Glass Timeline &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">as you're browsing through it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="701">you can very quickly find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">particular pieces of information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">because of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">pictures of faces. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="706">So if you're looking for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">lunch appointment, you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">recognize Richard there and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">you'll see a very quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="710">And you don't have to do that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">scan as you would for text. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="714">So any new topic related </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">to vision &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">perceived affordances. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="717">Every single time people talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">about perceived affordances, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">they talk about doorknobs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="721">I'm starting to think that maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">people think it's only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">about doorknobs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="723">So we'll do a whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">new example. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="727">So again, test chamber. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="728">And yeah, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="728">not a doorknob. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="729">That's not the test. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="730">You have to go through door. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="732">And the way you figure out how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">to go through the door is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">perceived affordance because you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">see the physics of how the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">thing's going to slide. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="737">But you go into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="737">test chamber. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="739">And there's pieces of trash </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">on the ground floor or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">some type of object. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="742">And what we're trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="742">to figure is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">do you recycle correctly? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">And the answer is, usually no. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="747">People are actually pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">lazy about this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1337">In other aspects related to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1337">memory is interruptions and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1341">the concept of flow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1343">So as the user is holding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">their working memory and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1345">they're doing these creative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1345">tasks, if they're really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">focused they can get into this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">particular psychological state </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1350">called flow. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1352">It has a few attributes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1353">Usually have a very clear </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1353">goal when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1354">doing creative work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1356">You're very focused. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1357">You're receiving constant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1357">feedback. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1652">If you to get to one of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1652">apps, hit this button. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1655">This was a screen that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1655">we rolled out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">in Ice Cream Sandwich. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1657">It actually doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">work very well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1658">And reason for that is they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">realized that they're blocked, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">so they don't read anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">and they just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1662">hit OK really quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1664">There's no repetition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1665">We only told them once. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1666">It wasn't linked to anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1666">there ready know. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">So they start to play </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">with the phone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1669">And then they say, well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">where are my apps? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1672">Then they proceed to hit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1672">everything until they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1674">finally find it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1675">So an alternative design </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">could be &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">we can't really to something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">they know, so just repetition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1680">If we just had this refrain for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1680">the first number of times </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">saying, all your apps are here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1684">that would start to set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">in after just a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">of times. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1689">Or after they'd hit the Control, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1689">then we'd stop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">showing it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1691">By doing this &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1692">it's not as loud or as broad </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1692">as that intrusive, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1696">interruptive flow that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1696">we initially had. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1699">But this would actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1699">perform better. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1701">It performs better because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1701">of the repetition. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1704">Now if you're linking to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1704">something that the user are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1706">already knows, it's OK to just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1706">have a single reference that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">they might ignore. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1712">So for instance, let's say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1712">you've already use the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1713">commenting system a lot. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1715">And now we say, you can also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1715">chat with document </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1718">collaborators. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1718">It's an adaptation of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1718">something you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1721">already been using. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1722">Here, because it links to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1722">existing knowledge, this'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">perform pretty well, even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">though it's just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">that one time interface. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1730">So another aspect of learning is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1730">recognition versus recall. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1735">Now the classic example is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1735">command line versus graphical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1738">interface, where the command </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1738">line's very difficult because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1741">you have to, in your own memory, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1741">remember all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">commands are and access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">them over time. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1746">And &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1746">it's actually a little bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1746">complicated than that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1748">That's true. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1748">But there's more going on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1749">And essentially what we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1749">doing is cognitive load </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">balancing, where in order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">of difficulty, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1754">recall is very difficult. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1756">Visual targeting is moderately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">difficult. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1758">And then movement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1758">is very easy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1760">So if we look at a variety of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1760">interfaces, a command line </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">versus the graphical interface, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">the graphical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1766">interface is going to perform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1766">better because it's mostly the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">visual targeting and movement. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">I can remember that there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1770">are alignment tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1772">I can't remember what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1772">they all are. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1773">But I'm able to look there and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">say, oh OK, a line left, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1778">hit that button. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1779">So it's a interplay between me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">and the interface, where I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1781">remembering some things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1782">It's remembering other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1782">things for me. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1784">And it's able to augment my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1784">memory because it's being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1786">shown graphically. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1788">And then the visual targeting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1788">is a little bit of work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1790">Interestingly, the voice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1790">interfaces are, at least in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1794">terms of cognitive load, more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1794">similar to a command line. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1796">The pulsing mic is kind of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1796">new blinking cursor because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">you have to remember, like for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">instance what all the Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1801">Voice Actions are. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1803">And &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">can anyone name all Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">Voice Actions? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1806">Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1807">So that's still, in the recall, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1807">very high cognitive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1812">load category. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1814">And then also interestingly is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1814">we're seeing interfaces that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1816">are in some ways just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1816">about movement. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1818">So like invoking Google Now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1818">once you've learned that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">behavior, you don't even have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">to do any visual targeting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1824">You're just swiping directly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1824">up off the bottom of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1826">screen to do it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1827">So it's in many ways one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1827">easiest interfaces because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1829">it's only on that third track, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1829">which was the easiest. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1832">Also swiping through the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1832">timeline on Glass &mdash; you're not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">doing very much visual targeting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">because it's such </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1836">low information density. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1838">And you just have the single </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1838">cards in the timeline. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1840">And you're just doing the gross </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1840">motor skills of Swipe or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1845">Accelerometer looking. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1846">So those are very easy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1846">interfaces, at least in terms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">of cognitive load. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1851">Another topic I want to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1851">about with learning is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1853">notion of learning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1853">with examples. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1855">Now, often people say, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1855">we need to create this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1858">interface in this particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1858">way because it's similar to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">this other product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1860">that exists. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">And users aren't going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">to use it otherwise. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1864">That's not entirely true. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1866">You can show the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">an example of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1868">how something works. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1869">And now it's consistent. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1870">Their futures experiences are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">consistent with that example. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1874">So they've effectively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">learned it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1875">People are pretty smart. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1877">So you're able to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1877">create innovative software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">that changes things from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">existing marketplace and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">playing field. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1882">You just have to bring people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1882">up to speed on why you made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1885">this changes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1886">So a couple examples of this &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1888">in 2006, the notion of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1888">the end of files. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1891">Obviously, people are very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1891">used to the file system. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1893">They're used to attaching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1893">things, sending them around. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1895">That's kind of broken. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1896">So how do you get this huge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1896">marketplace that is very sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">of set in the consistency </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">of how files </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1900">operate into a new model? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1902">And the answers is you just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1902">lay out a very quick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">argument for it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2110">It really bothers me that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2110">that's one of usability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">heuristics that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2112">focus on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2114">You do not need to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2114">products that are identical to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">what exists in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">marketplace. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2118">What you can do is you can have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">innovation and teaching. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2121">And people are smart, like you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2121">don't have to design for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2123">first-run interaction. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2125">You can bring people up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2125">to speed over time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2126">And they're going to understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">your product. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2128">And you can create interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2128">products that aren't just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">leveraging what's already in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2130">the marketplace for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2131">purpose of usability. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2133">So the final topic I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">to focus on is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2135">perception of time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2137">So interesting example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2137">here &mdash; just looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2140">at a progress bar. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2143">In this case, it's a pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2143">simple progress bar. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">We look at another one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2150">This one it slows down. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2151">You're like, come on, come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">on &mdash; and then finishes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2154">Versus the final one, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2154">it starts out OK. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2159">And then it speeds up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2159">towards the end. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2161">And of course, all these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2161">progress bars are taking the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2164">same amount of time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2164">to complete. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2165">But what's interesting is we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">actually really bad at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">gauging how long </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2167">something took. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2169">We don't really have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2169">internal chronometer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2171">What we're doing is we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2171">perceiving the process of time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2174">based off of change. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2175">So something that speeds up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2175">towards the end, is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2178">going to appear faster than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2178">something that slows down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2180">towards the end, even if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2180">the overall amount </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2181">of time is the same. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2182">And they're been a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">of studies on this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2184">In fact other products, have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2184">had slow progress bars. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2187">And everyone complained that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2187">file copying got slower, even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2190">though it was actually faster, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2190">which is crazy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2193">So it's important to know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">these types of effects. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2195">They're can actually be a 10% </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2195">variance in how long something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2198">people think something's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2198">going to take. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2200">Another example of this is if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2200">you're working on something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2202">like the Web Layout engine, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2202">where obviously there's a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">of people working very hard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">at making that quickly. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2207">So your immediate assumption </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2207">could be, well we'll just do a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2210">layout as things come in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2212">As soon as we have it, we show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2212">to the screen, quick feedback, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2214">it's all going to be great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2215">What's interesting is because we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2215">we're so bad gauging time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2219">And we only gauge time based off </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">of the individual changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2223">and how many changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2223">there were. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2225">That will actually appear to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">take longer than if you were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2227">just pause and then bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2227">everything in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">once you have it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2231">Because we mentally chunk that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2231">white space of before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2235">And we don't really know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2235">how long before was. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2237">We just know that, wow I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">have my whole page now. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2239">And it came in very quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2241">So there are all these aspects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2241">of how we're perceiving time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">that come to play with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">performance of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2245">applications and how you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2245">can optimize for that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2247">And our perception of time it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">kind of like an optical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">illusion, where we're not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">perceiving reality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2253">We're filtering everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2253">through our own hardware. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2256">And if you learn about our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2256">hardware, and if you learn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2258">about the biological </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2258">computational machines that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">are and that your software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2261">actually runs on, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2264">write better software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2265">And you'll be a better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2265">engineer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2267">So some quick recommended </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">reading, if you want to check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">out some books &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">Don Norman, famous cognitive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2270">psychologist. </span></p>
