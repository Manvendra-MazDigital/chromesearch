<p><span class="line" data-startTime="0"> LEPAGE: All right. Good morning everybody. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="0">Thanks for joining us. You know, I think back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">to the first website that I started building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">back probably 15 years ago or so, and it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">really about content, giving, putting content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">on the Web. It wasn't about interactive video </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">at all. All of the graphics that I had, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">most interactive graphic I had and the richest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">graphic I had was the little shovel guy, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">animated gif that was doing that kind of thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="32">And as the Web has matured, we've seen a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">more interactivity come. We've seen a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">more richer graphics, right? But a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">those things sometimes required a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">of black magic to happen or we've had to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="44">server side processing of all of our code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">in order to get those really rich graphics, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">really rich experiences, and really rich websites </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">and web applications. But HTML5 really gives </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">us the platform that we need to be able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">build web apps that feel like they're native, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">that feel like they've got the power, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">same experiences and really have those awesome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">webs &mdash; web apps that we expect. So we're talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">today about getting started with HTML5. My </span><span class="line" data-startTime="81">name is Pete LePage. I'm a developer advocate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">at Google. And I'll let Ernest introduce himself. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="85"> DELGADO: Yes. Thanks Pete. My name is Ernest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">Delgado and I'm also in the Chrome Developer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">Relations Team focused mainly on HTML5. Pete? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99"> LEPAGE: Awesome. Thanks. You can follow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">us on Twitter and we'll be having &mdash; spending </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">a bit of time on Twitter today. As we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">through, please if you haven't already, have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">a look at the SpeakerMeter website and provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">feedback as we're going. And don't forget </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">the BootCamp I/O and the Chrome Twitter hashtags </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">as we're going through these things. The plan </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">for today is we're going to talk about what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">is HTML5. We're going to dive into what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">can do with it and how we can start using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">it today. This is really sort of a 100-level </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">talk, but for those of you who have played </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">with HTML5 before, don't worry. There will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">be a few good nuggets in here. There's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">to be some really neat stuff. The other thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">that I want to mention is that we really can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">go through all of the new features of HTML5 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">in a single one hour session. We'd probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">be here for the next four hours and we'd get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">maybe half the stuff, so we just sort of picked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="154">a bunch of our favorites that we thought were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">the most interesting. All right. If you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">to see more, we'll have some resources at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">the end that you can go and check out. As </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">well, these slides and the code that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">showing today is going to be available to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">you after. So don't worry about scribbling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">down any notes or like any &mdash; anything, code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">snippets or anything like that. So the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">thing I want to start with is what is HTML5 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">and what does it mean? At Google, we think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">about HTML5 as the collection of web technologies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">that have really come to maturity in the last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">two to four years. So that includes things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">that give us a really rich development platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">as developers that we can go and use really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">rich APIs to provide offline access or offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">storage, so that I can store data on the user's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">computer without having to send it back and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">forth with cookies. Or that I can get access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">to things like device hardware. Getting access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">to maybe GEO location for the user or how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">their laptop is sitting, whether it's tilted, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">whether it's straight up and down, all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">that kind of information. But it also gives </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">us access to things that we can make our applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">run faster as well. And so, we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">dive into those. And it gives us access to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">things that make &mdash; allows to build more beautiful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">web apps. No longer are we limited to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="245">sort of, "Oh look, it's a white page with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">like a couple of words on it and it's not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="250">all that pretty." We can do some really rich </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">graphically intense stuff that we could never </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">do before with video and audio and canvass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">and CSS styling. So the way we sort of decided, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">we wanted to show you this is by building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">a web app that takes tweets from the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">Dev Rel Team and visualizes them in this kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">of neat way. It drops them down. So it's pulling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">all these tweets from Twitter and it's using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">CSS3 Animations to drop them, so all these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="286">guys here getting drawn and using CSS3 Animations, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">the older the tweet is the more transparent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">it becomes, so you notice on some of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">tweets you can kind of see, on those ones </span><span class="line" data-startTime="298">you can see through it, this one you can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">see through it at all. So we are using opacity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">to set the age of the tweets. We're using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">Geolocation to be able to provide information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="310">about where people are. If I have a look here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">this tweet here that's a little bit lighter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">on screen as I make it &mdash; mouse over it gets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">bigger, it's saying there's geolocation there, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="323">and in fact, we provided additional rendering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">of geolocation on these tweets. We also have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">notifications. I'm not going to turn these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">on right now because I want &mdash; we'll show &mdash; have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">a look at these a little later. But we also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">have an ability to be able to search. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">is I think one of the coolest things. So speech </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">input. So I can click this little guy here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">free cake. Sure enough, there's all the tweets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">that include the words free cake. All right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="360">the amount of code that I had to write to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">do that, not much. All right. Under the covers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="364">we're using IndexDB to store all the tweets, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">so that even if you weren't online you'd still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="373">be able to see all of these tweets. And we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">using Web Workers to go and get the tweets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">and put them into the database. So with that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">I'm going to pass it over to Ernest who's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">going to talk about the stuff that we did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">for the Rich User Experience. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="389"> DELGADO: Thank you Pete. So I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">show you some of these APIs that we've used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">for this app. And starting for speech input, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">which is the last one he demoed, and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">is the shortest snippet that you're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">to see today because actually, to enable this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">feature, we only added this attribute to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">input field that we already know. So the good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">thing is the browser is giving us a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">UI for free that we don't need to do with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">JavaScript. For instance here we have this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">input field inside this bubble, and when we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">click on the microphone does this part that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">you seen that is going to tell us, "Okay, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">it's time to talk." I'm going to try to say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">free cake with a much worst pronunciation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">of course. Free cake. Okay. At least it recognized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">it. So we have these words here, but now we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">want to do something else. We also have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">API that we can access from JavaScript and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">do more stuff. For instance, here if we attached </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">like an event to the input field and say when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">it changes, just trigger this function. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">event object returns these lists of results, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">and we can go through the list of results </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">to do different stuff. I'm going to do the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">same test here with the free cake. Free cake. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="469">And I didn't say it very well. So it was the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">second guess actually. The system understood </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">that they said create and the confidence for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">that was 0.2, so the confidence wasn't very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">high. But I'll try to pronounce it better, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">let's see. Free cake. So now it gets free </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">cake and with a confidence of 0.8, so still, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">we have a list of all the other guesses, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">free games, free skate and so on. But the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">confidence wasn't very high for that &mdash; this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="498">confidence as well as the string which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="498">called the utterance, these are data that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">we are getting from this API. And when we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">are saying a word this word is sent to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">cloud, as it happens with our phone, the voice &mdash; the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">voice recognition. We don't need to do any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">local voice training to get accurate results. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="510">It used to happen that with a local, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">desktop software for this matter, but now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">that we're using the cloud we don't need that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">anymore, and that's really cool. So another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">feature we were using the &mdash; in the app is Geolocation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="528">And this is really useful to build your apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">with customized content based on the location </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">of the user. And just &mdash; we are just checking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">for navigature &mdash; navigator.geolocation to check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">if the browser is supporting this. And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="536">using the watch position method, which is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">actually running in the background to check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">for the position constantly, and then in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">position parameter we get like the coordinates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">latitude, longitude, and one that is not showing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">here on the screen but is the accuracy or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">something like that, that actually if I'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">run this demo we're going to see. It says </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">that access denied because we need to enable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="564">geolocation. We can do it here, I think that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="564">we could have done that from this app as well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">because it needs to be like user enabled by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">side books which show location here, yes. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="579">I see. So help me here a bit. I need to claim </span><span class="line" data-startTime="579">the results for that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="590"> LEPAGE: What we did earlier, we did a rehearsal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">to make sure everything was working, and we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">like, "Oh let's just deny access for now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">so that way we can have it work properly when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">we actually go do the demo." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599"> DELGADO: Yes. I'm going to create here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="602"> LEPAGE: Yes. Helps to clear to that after </span><span class="line" data-startTime="603">you deny it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="603"> DELGADO: Perfect. Now it should work. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">let's refresh. So these you could see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">level of protection that the user has. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="615">when we ask here for geolocation it &mdash; it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="615">both asking us in the bother bar. We allow &mdash; allowing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">now this feature. And it's saying is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">we are at this position. Not very good actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="629">because it says actually that the accuracy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="629">parameter that I told you before it's saying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">that it's 22,000. So in the background he's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="635">using like IP-Lookup or any information that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">the browser has, like a Wi-Fi connection, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">like a spot &mdash; AP spots, so that's why it asked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">the user for permission for these kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">things. So as in all demos that you try it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">live it works, but try it at home and it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">be better. And the way we're using it here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">in the TweeterFall application is that he </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">mentioned before that the tweets that have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">geolocation attached in that geo object that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">you get when you use the Tweeter API. We are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="668">highlighting them here in this list. So we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="668">using this position of the tweet compared </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">with our position in local. And if that person </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">is very far that we chose in this fall down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">here, like smaller or bigger, but only for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="678">those with geolocation, in this case, it would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">be like this tweet of Mike West. So, how many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">people here haven't heard about Canvas yet? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">So &mdash; okay, not many. And it's not surprising </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">because this is one of the features that has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">been around for a long time in HTML5 and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">funny to see how we've evolved over time. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="703">Because it started with all these methods </span><span class="line" data-startTime="703">to make basic shapes and draw lines. And it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">has also other methods for transformations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="710">And as you can see here in this drawing, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">related but the edges are, like, kind of cut </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">off. And this is because we're not rotating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">that whole canvas element, only the content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">inside. And, obviously, the size it was like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">wider and not as much as high. And that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="724">just understand that we're doing the modifications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">at pixel level. Also when we rotate this image, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">there's no transition we have to do, like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">a four loop and do the animation by hand. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="736">That's why after this thing was kind of popular. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="741">There were many frameworks that where on top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">of that to kind of easy of these programming. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="747">Also, there's like a processing syntax wrapper </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">for that. So there are many libraries on top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">of Canvas. But the power of this is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">high. And also we can use images or videos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">to import it in the canvas, get the frames </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">and modify the pixels. And here &mdash; just as a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">proof of concept, we have these two images </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">here and just &mdash; they have been imported inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">the canvas just to place them, not a big deal. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="770">But then we can export that with the &mdash; to data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">URL, to Internet, to any PNG or JPEG back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">to the image tag if you &mdash; if we want. So we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">will go back to the TweeterFall app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="784">Another proof of concept that we put here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">was that right now the background is this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">CSS pattern and if we enabled like animated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="794">background is doing this fancy stuff that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="794">taking, like, some star's image putting it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">on &mdash; putting it on top with some opacity. Also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">doing this color changing and this animation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="807">and it was really complex to do that only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="807">with JavaScript or images so pre-running that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">with Canvas is much easier. So if you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">remind this rotation I did with Canvas, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">we want to rotate the whole element. Now we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">are able to do it with 2D transformations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="827">So, it needs actually &mdash; just from CSS, we just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="827">set some properties to transform and rotate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="832">like 90 degrees but the cool thing is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="832">if we combine that with transition then we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="837">have the whole animation between the two states </span><span class="line" data-startTime="837">and we didn't need to do like in Canvas like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="841">every frame redraw the whole thing. So in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="841">the tradition we're all saying &mdash; just saying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">800 milliseconds and that's what it's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">to last but now it means that we are able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">to do it on any element. So I hovered this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">code, it's going to do it as well, just because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">I pre-run it like that but I could do it on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">the title or on the whole page if I wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">to. So this transformation is the one &mdash; are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="862">the ones that we use in the Tweeter application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">to make this thing bigger. And, actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">the code, I think I have the snippet here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="873">These are the two stages I was talking about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="873">I'm saying like, an initial state where there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">no rotation at all and a final state that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">happens when I hover that tweet using the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">CSS selection. And then we have like the scale </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">that's why this &mdash; the tweet is getting bigger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="891">And some translations just to make it like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">go not outside of the boundaries and what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">happens here is that you see many lines because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">in CSS, when something new comes, they are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">like the browser prefixes that allows us to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">use that new feature in the browser. And later </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">when it becomes standardized, then we don't &mdash; we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">won't need that anymore. But, at least, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="914">browsers implement things with different syntax </span><span class="line" data-startTime="914">or little differences, we are able to do &mdash; use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">that right away in the browser using these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">prefixes. There are also 3D transformations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="927">These are really cool feature and also one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">of the latest. And here, when we say rotation, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">we can specify on one &mdash; what axis we're on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">in that rotation. And everyone &mdash; like a 90 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">degrees going to flip whatever we have on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="937">the screen and it's going to give like the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="941">impression of the 3D because we added this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="941">prospective parameter. So we didn't do anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">here with 3D in this app but if you pay attention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">to these slides, the way that they are doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">the transition, they are doing this kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">3D effect that where we're using the 3D Transforms. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="959">So this not meant to be like a whole 3D environment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">or a game. You have, like, the Web GL context </span><span class="line" data-startTime="965">in the canvas tag. We're going to not talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="965">about it because it's really a dense subject. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="972">But you have a specific talk on I_O tomorrow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="972">if you're more interested or if you are a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">game developer. And now, let's make our site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">prettier because actually, for many, many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">years, we had those eight fonts in our browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">and we were limited to those eight fonts. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="989">And since you shouldn't be using Comic Sans </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">for your site, we are limited to seven &mdash; eight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">font types. So the cool thing to them or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">Web fonts, that now with this feature, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1000">have access to thousands of fonts. Is this &mdash; to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1000">use this extension made by Pamela Fox, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1006">this point actually a list from an API that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1006">we have at Google is the Google Fonts API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1010">and we have all these fonts that we can preview </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1010">and when we selected anything on the page, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">like the code there is changing and we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">say, "Okay. How it looks here on my site?" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1020">And if we like this font for our site, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1020">we can copy-paste this code and put it in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">the header and boom, yes, we have the fonts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">available already. The only thing is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1031">if you want to host the fonts because, with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1031">this API, Google is hosting the font file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1036">for you. So if you want to get the true type </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1036">and host it in your own server just put it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1041">in the folder and then use the syntax in CSS. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1041">You say font family with a keyword that you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">going to use in your spreadsheet and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">source with a link to wherever you put your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">font type &mdash; font file. And, actually, here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">I think, you have seen already that this font </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1062">is actually text is not any much replacement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1062">or any crazy [INDISTINCT] that web developers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">used to do and is using this font for here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1066">I think the font for the text is also another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">one so it makes &mdash; actually, designers are really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">happy with this feature now. And the last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">feature I'm going to show you in this section </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1077">is Web Notifications. An easier way to understand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1082">this feature is if you are using chat or any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1082">chat or email software in your desktop but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1090">I wouldn't be surprised that all of you maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1090">are using web-based software for that already. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1094">But, obviously, if you are using still, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">the desktop, you'll be familiar with the notifications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1100">you have on the top right on Macintosh and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1100">on the top bottom windows. And we'll be, like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">kind of the scanned &mdash; similar to that but what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">we're seeing here actually are screenshots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">of the web notifications because, actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">we want this kind of feature for our web apps. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">I'm going to show the demo first here because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">as it happens with geolocation, you need the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">specific permission from the user and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">we have to say that, okay, we're allowed to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">do that. That's because we are the one the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1131">user to get, like, spam or any popup from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1134">any random site, he needs to know where he's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1134">giving permissions for &mdash; to receive these notifications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1140">So if we receive &mdash; let me see, for instance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1140">here, kind of &mdash; there are these notification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1148">here that it's showing more than the UI and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1148">this notification at desktop level. Now it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1154">disappearing. So this notification that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1154">get here and probably we're going to get some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">more &mdash; if some of my teammates tweet now, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">going to get those tweets from now until the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1162">end of the talk. And it doesn't matter if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1162">I focus on that app or you have the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">modified, see, this thing is showing right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">here now, from my boss actually. And I hope </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">she's not watching me. The snippet for that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">is that we have this function. And when we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1179">call this function, we check if this site </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1179">has permissions from the user to show notifications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1186">And we're using this single method to pass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">through parameters like a picture, a title </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">and the content. And, actually, since we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">doing it from Tweeter we have all the &mdash; that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">information from the json object of the &mdash; of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1195">the tweets. There's another kind of notification </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1199">that we're not showing here that is called, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1199">I think, create HTML5 note &mdash; HTML notification. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1204">So instead of three parameters, we parsed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1204">one single parameter with HTML content and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">that's going to show up in the notification. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1208">We're using a similar method to show and this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1214">is why the notification was hiding after a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1214">while. Because, by default, that thing &mdash; the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1219">thing is going to stay there until the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1219">goes and closes it. But maybe we think that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1225">that's annoying for him because there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1225">too many notifications up to the developer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1230">So we set &mdash; we set this set timeout and he's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">going to close after a while. And, actually, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">if you use Gmail or Google Calendar or even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">TweetDeck or some other similar app, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">enable this feature because they are already </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">supporting that. With that, I'm going to pass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1247">it over to Pete to talk about some more features. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1247"> LEPAGE: Awesome. Yes. Thank you, sir. All </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">right. So Ernest went through some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">sort front-end and user experience stuff that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">really allows us to make our applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">feel like they run on the desktop. I'm going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">to take a look at some of the things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">allow us to build applications that are more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">powerful, that give us more APIs than we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">ever had access to before. And really allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1277">us to do stuff that we couldn't do or if we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1277">did, we had to like, as I mentioned earlier, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1283">use some of that black magic, use some JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1283">that wasn't really meant to do something and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">innovate something through this and that and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1289">just not really pretty ways of doing things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1295">As we started building this app, one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1295">things we realized we needed to do was stored </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">data. And we could've done that using cookies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1299">but we wanted to store the configuration data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1305">for this application on the user's computer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1305">We use Web Storage to do that. Web Storage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1312">allows you to store name value pairs of data, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1312">so it's &mdash; you know, you've got the name and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1317">then value is only a string. So we're using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1317">that to store this configuration information. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1322">There's two type of Web Storage that are available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1322">to us. There's sessionStorage which, like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1329">it sounds like, its lifetime is for the session, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1329">so you close that window and you've lost access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1334">to it. And then there's localStorage. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1334">that last for until the user blows away their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1342">cache and clears out their browser. The way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1342">we're using this in our app is we've got another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">function called getSettings. And getSettings </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">says var settings equals localStorage and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1353">it goes and tries to get the string from localStorage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1353">It then tries to parse that string into a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1361">JavaScript object. Because it's in there as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1361">a string, we want to get it into an object, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1365">so we can handle it a little bit more accurate &mdash; easily. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1365">And so, settings, JSON.parse. Now I've wrapped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">that and try cache block because what I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1373">to do is say, hey, if you fail or if there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">any kind of problems with this thing, we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1377">just go create a new set of settings and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">we're going to pass those back. Then to store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1383">that data into the configuration, we just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1390">do localStorage, square bracket equals and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1390">you give it the key, and then you give it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">the string that you want to put in. Again, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">because we're taking a JavaScript object, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">we need to turn it into a string because we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">can't just shove a JavaScript object into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1407">there. We're using JSON.stringify, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1407">allows us to get our configuration data into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">the app. So all of the information that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">stored around which Tweeter username and which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1424">user list we want to store, as well as, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1424">know, how many tweets we want to show at any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">given time. Whether we want to, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1428">if I turn the notifications off and reload </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">the app; sure enough the notifications are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1436">off. So every time we start the app, we started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">in the same set of configuration that we used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">last time.  </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">We also wanted to store additional stuff on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">the user's computer that localStorage didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1457">really work for. We wanted to store all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">tweets that the user had seen on their computer. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1462">And so, indexedDB is a new set of, a new database </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1469">object that comes as part of HTML5 and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1469">allows you to store significant quantities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">of structured data, all right? Now, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">a couple of things that we're going to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1481">a lookup but before we dig into this one at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1481">all, I just want to stop and sort of grab </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1487">everybody's attention for one sec. A lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1487">the new APIs that you get access to is &mdash; with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1493">HTML5 are asynchronous. Put your hand up if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1493">you've done like an AJAX request and you know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1499">how you deal with, sort of the asynchronous, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1499">yes. So you know how with that kind of thing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1503">you have to give it a callback because the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1503">data might not be there when you go ask for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1508">it and it's going to go and do stuff asynchronously. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1508">Well, many of the APIs that we get as part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">of HTML5 are that same way, all right? And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">indexedDB is definitely one of those and you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">see in a sec how we &mdash; how we went about dealing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1520">with that. So, to initialize a database with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">indexedDB, I've created a function called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">initDatabase and I give it a callback for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1534">dbReady and that callback is called when my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1534">database object is ready. So there's a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1540">of things we need to do to initialize a database. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1540">First thing we need to do is set our version. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1546">So I've set var dbVersion, the answer is 42, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1546">you can use a number, you can use a string, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1551">you can use whatever you want in there as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1551">long as it's a legal JavaScript something, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1557">you can set it in there, all right. And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1557">we say, request indexedDB open. And that opens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1565">the database that says, "Hey, indexedDB go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1565">open yourself up for me." And here's where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1571">we have our first line where we need to deal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1571">with an async call, right? Because we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">know when that database is going to be ready, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1579">we can't just count on it being ready as soon </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1583">as we call open. So we say, request onsuccess </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1583">and I've created a function here. And I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">said database, now I have to declare this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1590">is a global variable because I want to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1596">it in a bunch of places, e.target.result, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1596">and that gives me access to the database. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">Then I want to check to see if the database </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">version that I've opened is the same one that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">I'm expecting. If it is, great, I'm just going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">to call database ready and we're good to go, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1611">and we can start using it. If it's not, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1611">we've probably made some changes to our database. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1616">Maybe it's a new instance if our application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">is running, or maybe we've create a new table </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">or we've change some of the object types that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">are in there. So, if it is a new version, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1626">we need to set the version to the new ones. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1626">We've got database set version and we set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1631">it. And then, again, the same thing, we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1631">to do an asynchronous call in and say, Ver.onsuccess </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1639">and I go in, I create the tables. So where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1639">you see here the object store name contains, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">so we check to see if it's already there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1646">If it's not, we go and we say, create the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1651">store and we set the key path to the index </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1651">that we want to use. And you can use whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">you want in your index here. And then we go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1657">and say, hey, we're ready, you can start using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1662">us. To get data from the database, same general </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1662">concepts apply. So, in this particular instance, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1672">all right. And this is the actual code from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1672">the app. If you actually go and look at our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1676">app and go view source, you're going to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1676">this function with this exact code in there. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1682">So we've set an item callback and we've set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1682">a completed callback. The item callback gets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">called on each item. So, like we go, and in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1687">fact use it to stick stuff into an array, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">and then we callback completed callback when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1694">we've done all of our looping through. Now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1699">you're going to notice these three lines, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1699">these three lines are pretty much the basics </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">of any indexedDB request. First thing we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">to do is do var trans database.transaction, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1711">all right? So we need to go to get a transaction </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1711">access into the database and in this case, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">because we're reading, we're going to do a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">read-only request, all right? So we're just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">saying, hey, read-only. Then we need to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">say store, trans.objectStore, we want to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1731">access to that table, right. We want to say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1731">"Hey, give me all of the items in that particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">table." And then to get the individual items </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">from there, store open cursor. Now, indexedDB </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1746">works via cursors, all right. So instead of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1746">like a SQL notation were you say, select star </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">from table tweets, right. This gives you a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1752">cursor and it allows you to iterate through. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">It's almost like a four each kind of statement, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1759">so you run through. In our onsuccess, once </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1767">we have our first cursor item, we say, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1767">go get our cursor. We check to see if our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">cursor's undefined because we're done when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">we've hit the undefined and we did the callback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1781">if we're done, and if we're not, we do the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1781">item callback. So we say, "Hey, I want you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1786">to take &mdash; I want to take you and I want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1786">just shove you into my array or do whatever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1791">you want." In our particular case, we're doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1791">a couple of things. We go and, as we pull </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1797">the stuff back, we go and add it to this list </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1797">on the right and we add it to the items in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1806">the &mdash; in the database. To add stuff to a database, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1806">similar concept. Those three lines are almost </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">exactly the same, right? We need to go get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1815">our transaction, access to the database, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">time we're going to change that first line, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1820">instead of doing a read-only we need to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1824">a read-write because we want to put stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1824">into the database. We need to then get the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">store, get that table and say, "Hey, we want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1830">access to the table." And then we can actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1836">start putting stuff into the database with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1836">store.add, all right. Store.add adds a new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">row effectively; it's the way to think about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">it. There's also store.put which allows you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1848">to replace an element. So if you've got, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1848">know, two elements and you want to put one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1852">in and replace one with the other, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1852">use store.put. Now, I haven't put anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1859">in my onsuccess or onfailure callback other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1859">than a console.log in this particular case. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1865">But in something like this, more than likely, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1865">you'd probably just want to put some error </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">handling in your onfailure and in your onsuccess </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">you might want to deal with something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1875">is, okay, we've already got the thing in there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1875">or what have you. All right. Helps if I open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1888">the lid. How many of you guys have seen this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1888">dialog popup or a similar dialog when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1892">surfing around on the Web, yes. Yes. That </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1892">dialog kind of sucks, doesn't it? You know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1898">one of the things with JavaScript is that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1898">JavaScript runs in the same thread as our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">UI, right? So that means if you try and do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1903">any complex JavaScript calculations and &mdash; or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">maybe you get yourself into a race condition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">or you're just doing something or somebody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">else is doing something more than likely, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1914">because we'd never write code that did this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">we're all &mdash; right? Yes. All right. Because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">you're running in that same thread and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1926">lock up, well, it feels like the browser locks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1926">up and the browser pops that dialog up and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1931">says, "Hey, I'm sorry, this guy is taking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1931">too long. Do you want to kill it or do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">want to wait for it?" So, there's a new set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">of functionality in HTML5 called Web Workers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">And Web Workers allows you to say, hey, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1944">want to take this chunk of JavaScript and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1949">I want to run it in a separate thread from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1949">my browser UI code. I want it to be completely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1956">separate, I don't want it to interfere, just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1956">go off and do your own thing. Just come back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1960">and tell me when you're done. So that's what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1960">Web Workers is, and if this really cool way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1965">to be able to go and run stuff off in another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1965">place. Now, I've got some sample code here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">and I'll show you how we're using this in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">the app, but I wanted to sort of walk through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1975">the sample code to give a specific example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1975">of where were the &mdash; where you'd do some real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">complex calculations. So, the calculated Fibonacci </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">Sequence if you remember those, that you add </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">the two previous numbers. Well, those get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">really computationally expensive as your numbers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1991">start to get larger and larger, right? So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1991">you trying and run that with a number of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">hundred and your browser is just going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">go plunk and stop working and it's not going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2002">to be pretty, right? So, I created a Fibonacci </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2002">calculator using a Web Worker. So the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">thing we do if we say var worker equals new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">worker and we give it a link to the JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2012">that we want it to go run, right? So it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2012">a separate JavaScript file, lives off in its </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">own little world. And then because it's running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2018">off in its own little world, the only way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2024">we can talk to it or it can talk to us is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2024">through post messages. All right? So we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2029">to listen for any messages that it's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2029">to send us. So we had add an event listener, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">that listens for messages and we're just going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">to popup a dialogue. And then finally we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">to send it a message, we need to tell it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">go do something. All right? So worker post </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2047">message and we send it 12. Then in our actual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2047">Fibonacci JS, so this is the actual code that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2054">running in our worker, right? We need to listen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2054">for messages, right? Because, well, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2061">sending it stuff so it needs something to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2061">listen. So, self.onmessage and we go and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">start using our Fibonacci sequence. So, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2068">go and do that calculation. When we finish, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">we do a post message to send back to our parent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">to say, "Hey, I'm done. Here's my value." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2080">All right? Now, the reason we need to do it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2080">this way is because it's running off in its </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">own little world, all right? It doesn't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">any other access to most of the things we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">used to. It doesn't have access to the window </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">object. It doesn't have access to the DOM. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2099">It doesn't have access to a lot of stuff, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2099">so the only way we can get messages back and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2103">forth is with the post message. So sure enough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2103">this guy runs and we get a result back with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2111">our Fibonacci sequence. Now, how are we using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2111">this in our application? In our index.html, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2119">we have a function called startWorker, all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2119">right? And that goes and it says, same thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">we saw before, var worker equals new worker </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2124">and it points to the script that we want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2129">start running in its own little thread. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2129">had add our event listener that says, "Hey, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2134">any time you get a message I want you to send </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2134">that message and handle it with newTweetHandler, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2138">so that newTweetHandler is going to go and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2138">handle any of the content that we send it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2144">from our worker." And then we tell our worker, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2144">"All right, time to get started. You're good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">to go." Within the worker, again, same concept, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2148">self.addEventListener. We listen for new messages </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2157">and we start the function that's going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2157">go on read the tweets. So this is the &mdash; in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2161">our worker thread, this is what's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2161">going up to Twitter and say, "Hey, Twitter, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2165">got any new messages for me? All right. Nope. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2165">Okay, fine, thanks. Got any new messages? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2172">Oh, you do. Great, thanks." So it then takes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2172">that message and it sends it over to our application. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2178">Now, you'll notice I used the line here, importScripts; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2178">importScripts. Remember I said earlier we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">don't have access to the window object? We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">don't have access to the DOM? Means we can't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">go into adjacent P request. We can't create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">script elements in our DOM so we can't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2199">any of that stuff going. So we need a way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2199">that we can be able to insert script into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">our application. And so there's a method called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">importScripts and it works synchronously, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">right? So this one is not a sync. This is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">synchronously. So it goes up to Twitter and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2217">I've just shortened the URL here just so that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2217">it would fit on the slide. But it goes up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">to Twitter. It requests the tweets. That then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2221">inserts the JavaScript that Twitter sends </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">back into our worker and then that code gets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2230">executed. All right? So, that's how web workers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2242">work. They go through. They grab our information, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2242">off in their own little world and they send </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2248">messages back and forth. All right. I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2248">to go to sort of some basic stuff for a sec </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2256">because I think this is one of my &mdash; it's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2256">easiest part of HTML5 I think but it's also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2262">one of my favorite parts of HTML5. HTML5 makes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2262">our markup and our seman &mdash; our markup much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">more semantic and much easier. How many of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2269">you guys have the HTML 4.01 DOCTYPE memorized? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2278">Right. You know, usually when I asked that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2278">there's like two people who put up their hand </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">and there's probably two people who have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">memory that good. I could tell you I don't, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2287">right? Like, I know it's DOCTYPE and that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2287">about as far as I stop. All right? I'm used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2293">to the tools inserting it for me. HTML5 gives </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2293">us a new DOCTYPE that's a heck a lot easier. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2302">DOCTYPE HTML, much easier than that big, long, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2302">crazy thing. And this will stick all of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2310">browsers into their most compliant rendering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2310">mode giving us all of the HTML5 features. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2316">One of the other things that becomes easier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2316">is we've got this meta charset equals utf-8. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2322">We don't have to go and put in all those big, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2322">long complex name and value and content and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2328">all that kind of stuff. We've simplified and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2328">made our markup a lot easier. There's also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">a bunch of new semantic elements and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">went through when they were going and deciding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2342">which semantic elements to add by looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2342">at all of the markup that you guys have all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2348">written over time. And they looked at what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2348">classes and what ID's appeared most often. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2356">Sure enough, things like header, footer, article, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2356">nav were the most common classes and ID's. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2364">So why not actually give those their own elements. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2364">They also changed the meaning of a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2372">elements. So elements that had a stylistic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2372">meaning in the past, they changed those to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2378">have a semantic meaning now. I think my favorite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2378">one of those is small. It's still going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2383">render in the same way, it's still going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2383">be small text, okay? But what's going to happen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2388">is instead of it rendering &mdash; instead of it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2388">just having the visual meaning, it now has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2394">a semantic meaning and that semantic meaning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2394">is the small print or the fine print that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2399">on the bottom of a legal document or maybe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2399">the fine print that's on the bottom of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2404">webpage. So, it gives it a semantic meaning. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2404">There's also a bunch of elements that, well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2410">they haven't been deprecated, they've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2410">obsoleted if that's a real word, okay? And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2417">they're still going to work. They're still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2417">going to render exactly like they did before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2421">if you're using them in your markup today, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2421">they're still going to work. But the only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">thing that's really going to happen is your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2426">friends are going to look at your code and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2428">your friends will laugh at you. That's about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2428">it, right? And honestly, do we need a reason </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2434">to get rid of the marky tag? Like, come on. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2434">Really? The bling tag? Things like center. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2441">You can do that with CSS style. So that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2441">why those elements are gone now. In our application, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2450">the way we actually use this is we created </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2450">the application really only using three main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">sections. Across the top we've got our header </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2455">element, all right? And that's just an element </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2462">that runs across top marks our header. On </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2462">the left, we've got a section that contains </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2467">all of our falling tweets and on the right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2467">we've got an aside and that aside is the tweets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2473">on the right. All right. Form elements. Bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2473">of new stuff to make form work easier, right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2484">so that if you've got input types, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2484">a bunch of new ones like &mdash; excuse me, email, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2492">phone number, dates, times, and things to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2492">make validations significantly easier. One </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2499">of the cool things about these new elements, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2499">think about like on a phone if you are going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2505">to enter in a phone number, isn't it nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2505">when the device actually shows just the keypad? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2511">So by doing that, you can not only provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2511">functionality for the device but you can also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2518">add placeholders and patterns. So let's take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2518">a look at at our application for a sec. I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2525">going to pop this open. There's a couple of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2525">things that are going on. I'm going to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2530">this text code here. Notice that there are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2530">a couple of things happen. This guy turned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2536">to some light gray text. I'm not sure if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2536">can read it in the back but it says username. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2541">That's a placeholder, right? If we wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2541">to do a placeholder in the past, we had to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2545">do that with JavaScript and it was kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2545">a pain in the butt because sometimes the JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2550">wouldn't fire at the right time and &mdash; or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2550">user would start typing before the placeholder </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2554">got popped in and then all of a sudden, oh, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2554">not only does the user have what they type </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2559">but they also have a place &mdash; well it just got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2559">to be this big mess, right? And unless you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2564">had like awesomeness coding skills, not exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2564">the most fun. So I'm going to put this back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2572">in here. There's also this range element that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2572">allows us to specify a range. There's all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2579">sorts of new ones, the code that we've got, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2579">all right? So, there's what we've got for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2585">the placeholder. I say placeholder equals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2585">username and so that placeholder just automatically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2590">appears. We've also got a required attribute. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2590">I want to point this one out specifically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2598">because this is something called the binary </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2598">attribute. And the first time I ever used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2602">it, it goofed to me up pretty significantly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2602">because binary attribute is true if it's there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2609">It doesn't matter what you set the value to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2609">If it's there, the value is true. All right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2615">If you want to go and set a value on it, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2615">can. You can say required equals required. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2619">You could say required equals true. You could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2619">say required equals, hi mom. All right? All </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2625">of those are going to evaluate to true. What </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2625">happens if you say required equals false? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2633">It's true. So, keep that one in mind because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2633">I kid you not, I probably spent half an hour </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2640">one day when I first came across binary attributes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2640">and I was just like, "It set to false, I know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2646">it set to false." I'm looking at my markup; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2646">I'm using the developer tools, until I realized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2651">what a binary attribute actually meant. For </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2651">the required attribute on form elements, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2659">that's going to do is that's going to stop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2659">the form from being submitted unless the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2663">has actually entered text in there. We've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2663">also got some new CSS selectors that allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2669">us to provide much more visually intense stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2669">So, I can say, "Hey, input, when you've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2676">a focus," right? Or I could say, where, "input:required:invalid." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2676">I want you to have a different set of styles </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2684">then when you have input, required and valid, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2684">right? So, that's why you saw the checkmark </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2691">or the little red box. We've got an ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2691">to just with styling, right? In the past, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2698">if we did this, we have to right some pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2698">crazy JavaScript to do this. We had to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2702">somebody's library or it's just one of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2702">things where we didn't get the richness that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2706">we can do with CSS 3. One of the other things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2706">that we wanted to do was provide a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2716">fast experience, right? It's really important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2716">that as people are using web applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2722">that they just are fast, right? They don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2722">want to be, "Oh, I clicked on this link and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2726">then, you know, it's the Web of the 1990s </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2726">and I'm on the dial-up modem and, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2731">I'm waiting for my page." We want things to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2731">be fast. Application cache allows us to cache </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2738">our entire application on the user's computer. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2738">Now, you're probably sitting there going, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2742">"Well, doesn't caching just do that in general?" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2742">And yet, it mostly does. But, you've all &mdash; probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2747">only got a cache of maybe 50 or 100 megs or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2747">maybe you've cranked it up and you've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2753">a fairly big cache. But think about all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2753">pages that you visit everyday and how quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2758">that cache gets blown away, right? You've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2758">just &mdash; you've looked at so much stuff that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2763">you've clear that cache out, now, you go to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2763">that application and it's got to re-download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2767">everything. Well, that kind of sucks. With </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2767">App Cache, you can actually say, "Hey, I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2772">you to store all of the data about my application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2772">on the &mdash; on the computer. The way you do that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2779">isn't the HTML element; we need to add a manifest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2779">file. That manifest file is a file that serve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">from our server that says, "Hey, this is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2785">stuff that you should cache locally on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2793">user's computer." In the actually cache file, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2793">its got a particular format, you got to say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2800">cache manifest, you don't have to put a version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2800">in there, I'd recommend it because the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2804">that the browser knows whether you're application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2804">has been updated is by looking for changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2810">in that file, all right? So, you may change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2810">one of your index.htm, all right? The browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2817">is not going to bother to go check to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2817">if index.htm has been updated because it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2823">cache locally. So, that's why you need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2823">change the version. It'll go up every time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2827">it'll try and get this app cache file and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2827">do that one thing to do sort of call-out because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2835">it's, again, one of those little things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2835">I thought with for about 20 minutes one day. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2842">When your server serves the app cache file, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2842">it need to be served with the mind type of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">text cache-manifest, all right? So, you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2848">need to set that into htaccess or however </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2853">you're doing that, you need to go do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2853">There's also a bunch of JavaScript APIs that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2859">allow you to go and really get program adit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2859">with your App Cache. So that you can update </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2866">the application at specific times, maybe you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2866">only want to update it when the user first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2871">starts the application. Maybe you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2871">ask the user before you update it because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2875">you're making some major changes or a breaking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2875">change or something like that. So, you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2880">got to set a JavaScript APIs that really allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2880">you to go through and be much more powerful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2886">with App Cache. So, with that, I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2886">pass it over to Ernest to talk about some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2892">of the tools and resources. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2892"> DELGADO: Thanks, Pete. I'm going to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2895">really quick through this. And now that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2895">seen APIs that we can use in our web app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2902">we may want to start coding and &mdash; but not doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2902">it from scratch. So, it's more mentioning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2908">some tools here that will help us to do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2908">The first one is Boilerplate. With Boilerplate, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2915">you can go there and get the files that actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2915">would use &mdash; you would use as a template for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2922">your app and it's at a different level. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2922">there's like an index.html with the all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2927">header and the basic step that you need. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2927">you needn't to worry about it. It also have &mdash; at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2934">JavaScript level has like the includes that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2934">if you want jQuery or the analytics snippet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2940">in your &mdash; in your page, you have that there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2940">as well. And it sees as level there are many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2944">tweaks as well that you have &mdash; as like the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2944">recent CSS, you have the template there or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2949">for instance, Media Queries. Who in the audience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2949">knows Media Queries? Not many. It's just like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2956">a syntax to make your layout of the page change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2956">depending on the device that is looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2961">your page, so if it's a mobile browser, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2961">can say, "Okay, from this width to this other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2966">width, change the layout to adapt to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2966">screen." Also, there's a list of what we call </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2973">Polyfills, because when you started calling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2973">these APIs, you may not have the support in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2979">all browsers that you want to support. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2979">I think it would be supported twice. But then, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2985">this Polyfills are kind of a JavaScript scene </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2985">that it's looking for a work around. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2990">actually taking care of that work around 100%. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2990">So, the perfect Polyfill lets you write that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2996">feature in modern syntax and it's going to &mdash; the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2996">Polyfill's going to manage that to make that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3002">feature work in the browser. So, it's possible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3002">that not all the features have fallbacks for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3008">all browsers, so that's one in your code; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3008">you should maybe do the &mdash; like some fallback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3015">case or a graceful degradation. But instead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3015">of looking for the browser version, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3021">is not a very reliable technique, it's better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3021">to do like feature detection. And for that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3026">you should use, or you can use Modernizr, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3026">which has this necessary syntax that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3030">put in your if statements and if that feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3030">is supported, do something, otherwise do the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3037">fallback. If you want to take a look at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3037">growing support that all browsers are having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3041">now with HTML5 features, go to this site, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3041">it's really cool, it has all the tables and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3045">version numbers and green if that feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3045">supported, caniuse.com. And another interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3052">tool that we've been using for a long time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3052">maybe another browser is this kind of debugging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3056">tool in the case of Chrome is called like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3056">The Chrome Developer Tools. And tomorrow, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3060">I think... </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3060"> LEPAGE: Today &mdash; this... </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3061"> DELGADO: Oh, today? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3061"> LEPAGE: Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3062"> DELGADO: Okay. So, today, there's a talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3062">from [INDISTINCT] going through all the details </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3066">that the things you can do actually in this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3066">debugger that there are things that I even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3070">didn't know. And the cool stuff here is that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3070">it's also &mdash; it has the capabilities to debug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3075">features like Web Workers or App Cache that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3075">it was very difficult to debug if that wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3080">supported because Web Workers has a separate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3080">JavaScript file. So, these debuggers actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3085">prepared for that. Some resources that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3085">are maintaining for with sample code, tutorials, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3095">demos on html5rocks.com. A couple of books </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3095">that are quite interesting, Bruce Lawson and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3099">Mark Pilgrim, and I think that's it with app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3099">resources. So, I'm going to pass it over, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3105">Pete to wrap up the presentation. So, all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3105">can go wait. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3110"> LEPAGE: Awesome. So I'll just talk quickly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3110">about Chrome Frame. If you've not played with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3115">Chrome Frame before, super useful utility, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3115">if you're stuck on older versions of IE for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3121">any specific reason, Chrome Frame will allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3121">you to run HTML5 applications within Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3129">Frame. So, we've talked about some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3129">great APIs and application level support that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3136">HTML5 gives you. And we've also talked a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3136">about some of the really cool rich user experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3143">stuff that we can really start building with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3143">HTML5. I'm really excited to see what you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3148">guys start building in terms of web applications. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3148">This is really our opportunity to change the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3153">Web from being a bunch of web pages and websites </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3153">to really being web applications that really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3160">just change the way we think about the Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3160">and what we do on it. So, I encourage you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3165">guys to go start playing with this stuff and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3165">go using that. There's a couple of sessions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3170">today. There's the Free Cake Session that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3170">also goes into HTML5 development with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3176">Chrome Developer Tools, the two hour hands-on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3176">lab. Really cool, as well as the Building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3182">and Publishing Apps with the Chrome Web Store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3182">at four. The rest of the week, whole bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3188">of really awesome stuff. If you make it to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3188">one session that is my favorite, the Showcase </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3194">for Web Devs, wow and a how really, really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3194">cool session. I've seen some of the demos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3199">these guys are doing, blow your pants off. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="3199">With that, I want to say thank you guys very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3205">much. Please go fill out an evaluation form. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3205">And thank you. We'll open it up to questions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3210">now, but I know that some of you seemed to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3210">be really hungry. So, feel free. But we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3215">stick around and answer any questions you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3215">want. Thank you. </span></p>
