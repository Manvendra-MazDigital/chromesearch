<h1>Google I/O 2013 &mdash; Upgrading to a Chrome Packaged App</h1>

<h2>Joe Marini</h2>

<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/e0W2szZ2qhg">youtu.be/e0W2szZ2qhg</a><div id="transcript"><p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: All right. Let's get started. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks for coming. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">My name is Joe Marini. This is Upgrading to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">a Chrome Packaged App. I'm a developer advocate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">here on the Google Chrome team. You can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">I've used my considerable clout within Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">to get the highly-sought-after end-of-the-day </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">slot, but thanks, all, for coming. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="25"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: So before I get started, let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">me do the obligatory survey. How many people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">have heard of Chrome packaged apps before? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="33">[ Show of hands ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="33"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: Wow! That's amazing. Everybody. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="36">Wow. Okay. All right. Thanks very much. Good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">night. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="39">All right. Can you guys here me okay? Volume </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">all right? One of the great things about being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">a New Yorker, no one ever says, "Hey, Joe, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">can you speak up?" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">All right. So here's what we're going to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">about today. I'm going to talk about why would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">you want to build a packaged app, what are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">packaged apps all about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="56">How many people saw Eric Ky's session yesterday </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">on the state of the nation? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="61">Okay. Not everybody but some of you. All right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="61">So in that case, I'll go over some interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">demos as well. So I'll talk about the structure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">of a packaged app, why you'd want to do this, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">but most importantly, what I want to cover </span><span class="line" data-startTime="70">in this session is the issues that you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">probably going to face when you take an existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">Webapp and go to make a packaged app out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="83">it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="83">So let's go ahead and get started. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="86">And by "get started," I mean, let's take a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">look at some cool demos. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="90">So if you &mdash; now that you guys have Pixels, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">if you set it to be on the dev channel, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">can go to the Chrome Web Store. How many people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">have gone to the Chrome Web Store in the past </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">to get stuff? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">[ Show of hands ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="101"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: Okay. We lost a few. All right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="101">There's this thing called the Chrome Web Store, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">and in your Pixel, when you go to the AppLauncher, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">there's an icon there. It says "Chrome Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">St" and that means store. They just couldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">fit it all on one line. But you go to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">little shopping bag icon and you'll go to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">the Chrome Web Store. And if you do this in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">dev channel, you'll see the new UI where we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="118">have some of the newer packaged apps that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">our partners have been working on to get into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="124">the store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="127">So we haven't put these live to everybody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">yet. Right now it's only in dev channel on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">Windows and Chrome OS, but you can actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">see what they'll look like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="137">So let me just start off by showing you a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="137">couple of these apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="140">This is The Economist, from FT labs, so The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">Economist is a great example of an app that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">is a content consumption app for &mdash; for both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">online and offline. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="152">So obviously the content has to come from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="152">somewhere, so when I'm on line, I can go get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">the content, but you notice that here in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">UI, it says "Available to read off line." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">So what has happened is, this app, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">it's a packaged app &mdash; and you can tell that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="168">There's no URL bar &mdash; right? &mdash; there's no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">back/forward buttons &mdash; right? &mdash; why would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">you want that in an app? It has cached its </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">data locally. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="176">So, you know, I can go and read stuff off </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">line, if I make the UI a little bit bigger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="181">You can also see that it's &mdash; it's responsive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="181">and the nice thing about this is because we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">have a rich windowing API, when I close the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">app and reopen it, it will remember its windows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">position, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="195">So these are some of the things &mdash; I'll talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">about this throughout this session, but these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">are the kinds of things that you'll need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">remember when you're building a packaged app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">because when you're an app, you now have control </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">over the window. The browser no longer says, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">"Here's how big you are," right? You can control </span><span class="line" data-startTime="210">how big your window is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="210">All right. Let's take a look at another example. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="216">This is 500 Pixels. How many people have heard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="216">of 500 Pixels? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">Right. Oh, good. A good many of you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="220">So 500 Pixels is a &mdash; is a professional photography </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">discovery application, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="227">So professional photographers use this app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">to get their photos out there, and you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="232">see &mdash; now I'm on my Pixel, right? So I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">using my finger to scroll through this. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">can see nice touch responsiveness. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="241">Again, works just fine off line. If I kill </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">the network connection, fire this app back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">up, it has cached the data locally and I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">look at whatever photos I had downloaded prior </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">to losing the connection. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="251">Okay. Let me show one other example. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="257">And to &mdash; oops. To do that, let me just jump </span><span class="line" data-startTime="257">out really quick. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="260">Now, while this is starting up, this is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">game called So Many Me. One of the questions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">I get from developers all the time is, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">know, "I've got this existing code that I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">built using, say, Native Client or Unity." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">In this case, this game actually was built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">&mdash; you can see right here it was built with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">Unity. So this is an example of a loud application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">that was built using Native Client and Unity, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">and it's a game. It's actually a pretty great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="287">game, so I'll just go ahead and start it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="287">You can see that it's got some nice animations. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="291">Let me go ahead and skip through this part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">because I've already done that. But you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">it's, you know, nice smooth game play, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">You can see the little animated trees in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">background. We've got some blurring effects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">going on there. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="306">So again, you can also see here at the top, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">when I mouse over the window, that it has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">this title bar that comes and goes, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">So again, another clue that it's &mdash; it's an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">app, it's not a browser-based thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="317">But to be clear, all the stuff that you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">seeing was built, with the exception of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">game, in HTML5, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, all of these are built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">using native web technologies. They just happen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">to be packaged up as applications, and because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">they're packaged up using Chrome packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">apps, they run on four runtimes just right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="340">out of the box. Right? Mac, Windows, Linux, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">Chrome OS. And the plan, the vision that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="346">have for this platform is that these apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">will run wherever Chrome runs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="351">So in the future, that means Android and iOS, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">and we're working with Adobe on the Cordoba </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">project to make that happen, okay? So that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">six runtimes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="361">All right. Let's talk a little bit about why </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">you'd want to do this. So why take a Webapp, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">why build a packaged app out of it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">So Webapps are great, right? I come to praise </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">Webapp, not to bury him, right? We all love </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">Webapps. They're all really useful. Webapps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">you know, they're great, right? Until they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="381">not. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="381">There comes a point in time when Webapps are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">decidedly not very great, right? We've all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">seen &mdash; we've all seen this, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">So there's a &mdash; there's off line cases. There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="388">&mdash; there's times when Webapps just simply </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">don't work very well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="393">Games, right? Games on the web are awesome, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">right? Full keyboard, mouse input. Games just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">rock! Until they don't! </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">Right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">There's times when, you know, you're be building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">a game and you want to be able to give your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">game players the same kind of experience that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">they would get if they were using a real gaming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">machine, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">So access to the USB, access to Bluetooth. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="416">You can't really do that on the open web. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="421">At least not today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="421">So packaged apps solve a collection of problems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">that we've come to notice over the years at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">Google and also elsewhere in the industry, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">so first, packaged apps run off line by default. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="432">Okay? By virtue of packaging up all your assets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">and storing them locally on the machine, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">just get offline access. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="443">Now, that has some implications for app design </span><span class="line" data-startTime="443">that I'll talk about in a little bit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="448">Packaged apps also give you access to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="448">platform's capabilities and the platform's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">hardware. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="453">So for example, being able to store files </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">in the filesystem, access the USB and Bluetooth, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">In the case of Chrome, because these are built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">on our platform, things like synchronizing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">data. You know how in Chrome you set your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">bookmarks and then you sync them and you go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">to some other computer and all your bookmarks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">are there, right? As a packaged app developer, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">you can also do that. You can take advantage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="475">of the synchronization architecture that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">do. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="481">Packaged apps give you a much richer, immersive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">user experience. Right? I mean, you saw examples </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">of this, right? There are just some applications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">where they don't benefit from back buttons </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">and URL bars. They just get in the way, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">What does a back button mean in a game like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">So Many Me, right? So why not just package </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">that up as a true app where the user is immersed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">in my experience? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">And finally, distribution. So distribution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="509">and updates take place via the Chrome Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">Store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="514">So when you package your app up, you put it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">in the Chrome Web Store and now you make an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">edit to it and now you want those updates </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">pushed out to people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="522">It takes advantage of the same update mechanism </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">that we use. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="526">So every so often, we ping the server, say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">"Hey, is there a new version of the app?" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">If there is, it gets downloaded. You as a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">developer don't have to worry about that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="535">You publish your updates, people get them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="540">All right. So now that I've talked a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">bit about what packaged apps are and why you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">might want to do them, let's start talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">about what it takes to go from a Webapp to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">a packaged app. So the structure of a packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">app is actually pretty simple. In an existing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">Webapp, you have all your content, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">You have your HTML, your JavaScript, your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">CSS, and that's what you deliver from your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">server. And in the world of Chrome packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">apps, you continue to use that same structure. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="571">You build your HTML, your JavaScript, all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">the assets that you would normally use to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">build any other kind of app. All we do is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">put some infrastructure around that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="581">Okay? So we add a &mdash; a manifest file that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">explains to the Chrome platform what the app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">is, what its name is, what version, what it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">can do like permission-wise, so on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="593">There's a background page and a main JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">file where you specify things like start-up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">events, right? You listen for the app being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">launched and create your UI. And in fact, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="605">that background HTML page is actually optional. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="611">If all you do is have your logic in the JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="611">file, we'll just generate that for you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="615">So really only two things you have to do on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="615">top of your existing app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="619">So let me just take a quick &mdash; this is a &mdash; this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">is, after all, a developer conference. Let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">take a look at some code and &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">All right. So let me switch over to my editor. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="632">All right. So here's an example. Can you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="632">read the code okay? Yeah? All right. So here's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">an example of a typical manifest file, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">It's just a set of json, and it explains things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">like, you know, what the version of your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">is, you know, what its name is, things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">that. So this gets packaged up as part of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">the packaging process to go to the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">Web Store and the other part of it is this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="653">file right here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="659">Now, this &mdash; the code that I'm showing you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">is for &mdash; on our &mdash; on our Github, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">that windowing API example. You'll notice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">that it's all just standard JavaScript. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="668">only thing that we're doing differently is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="668">that we have these Chrome APIs that let you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">get richer access to the platform capabilities. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="674">And the philosophy that we've adopted is whenever </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">the open web provides a capability, then we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">just use it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="684">Right? So file systems and so on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="684">If it doesn't and there's a need for something, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">then we'll fill that in with a Chrome API. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="689">But again, the &mdash; the driving vision is, we'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">like to standardize as much of this as we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">possibly can. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="698">So &mdash; all right. Let's go back to the... </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="698">Okay. So let's take a look at some of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">issues I brought up earlier, right? So offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="705">by default. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="710">So again, just to reiterate, everything in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="710">your app, all of the resources, the UI &mdash; right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">&mdash; your graphic assets, everything, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">all local. Right? That all gets installed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">when you install the app. When you install </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">the app, just like a user would install any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">other app, that's &mdash; your experience is I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">just getting an app. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="726">Now, this has some implications, right? So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="726">first, you have to think about what the disconnected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">experience is going to be, including first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">run. I might download your app &mdash; right? &mdash; run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">to the airport, get on a plane. I've got no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">connection. What's my first run experience? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">So you need to think about what kinds of features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">do you need to make available when you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">off line, right? So not every feature may </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">make sense off line. And in fact, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">if you think about some of the most cloud-connected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">applications that are out there, so like imagine, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">I don't know, a videoconferencing app like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">Hangouts or something, right? Now, obviously </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">that doesn't work if you have no connection, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">so you need to be able to be on line for that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="770">But there's no reason why, when I'm off line, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">I couldn't do things like look at my contact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="774">lists &mdash; right? &mdash; and see a call history </span><span class="line" data-startTime="774">and so on, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">So even in the case of the most connected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">apps, there's &mdash; there's usually scenarios </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">where things, you know, can and should work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">off line. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="786">You need to consider the case of handling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">stale data &mdash; right? &mdash; and synchronization. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="794">So the user is working in your app, they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="794">off line, then they go on line. Now what happens, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="798">right? That's a &mdash; that's an issue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="798">And again, restore data locally. Now, there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="803">are certain parts of the web platform that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="803">we don't support for very good reason. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="807">for example, we don't support window.local </span><span class="line" data-startTime="807">storage. Anyone want to know why? Or take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">a guess? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811"> (Speaker is off microphone.) </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="814"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: It's synchronous, yes. Right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="814">So synchronous APIs block the UX thread. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">in cases where APIs are synchronous or are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">going to cause problems like that, we provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">asynchronous counterparts for them instead. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="826">So in this particular case, you would use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="832">one of the Chrome APIs instead of local storage. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="832">So this means you have to plan for a great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="837">offline experience, right? Factor the app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="837">figure out what you need to keep off line, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">do the things that you would normally do, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">keep your JS separate from your HTML, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">Figure out what you want to make available </span><span class="line" data-startTime="848">off line. You can use web standard events </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">like the online property and online/offline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">events to figure out when you are available, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">when you're connected to the web. Store data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">with things like Chrome storage local &mdash; in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">this case, it's an asynchronous API &mdash; you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">can use the HTML5 filesystem to do that. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">in your manifest file, set the offline enabled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">flag. That way in the Chrome Web Store, users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="875">can see, "Oh, this works off line," a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="875">treatment that we give it in the store. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="881">So here's an example of how you would store </span><span class="line" data-startTime="881">data using the Chrome storage API, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">So let's suppose I've got some value in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">form and I want to save that. Instead of using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">local storage, I would say Chrome storage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">local and then set, and then that takes a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="896">whole set of key value pairs and I have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="896">function that gets called when the data has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">been stored. Right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">So we've solved the synchronous problem in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">that case. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="904">Okay. In addition to offline by default, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">its counterpart, which is what we call cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">by default. So today, users increasingly expect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">that their data is going to just be everywhere </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">that they are, and when you build packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="922">apps &mdash; right? &mdash; users are going &mdash; they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="922">going to have the expectation of your app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="926">They're going to think to themselves, "Well, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="926">you know, I want my data to be where I am." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="929">And again, we provide ways to do that, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="929">this has implications, right? So they're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">to expect things to sync. Your app is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">to have to figure out how to handle things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">like conflicts. And you need to remember that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">your app might be used across multiple OSes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">and form factors. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="944">So we have a bunch of cloud features in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="950">platform that you can use to take care of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="950">some of these things, so a few minutes ago </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">I talked about Chrome storage local. There's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">also Chrome storage sync. Chrome storage sync </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">is pretty much the online synchronization </span><span class="line" data-startTime="960">part of storing data. So this is how, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="966">know, in our case we synchronize bookmarks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="966">If you want to synchronize things like preference </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">settings or usernames or whatever other small </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">pieces of data, you would use this API to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="976">We also provide a synchronized filesystem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="979">API to synchronize larger pieces of data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="979">So for example, if you have, you know, large </span><span class="line" data-startTime="985">files like, you know, megabytes of data that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="985">you want to sync, this is how you would do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">that instead. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="988">Now, today, the way that's architected is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="991">it uses Google Drive, but it's open. So in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="991">the future, you know, we might support other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">back-end storage, but out of the box, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">Google Drive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1001">We also recently announced the Google cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">messaging architecture, right? The push messaging? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1006">So your server can send push messages down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1006">to your app, and because the &mdash; the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">packaged app system is local and running on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">the machine, your app doesn't have to be awake </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1018">in order to receive them, right? The runtime </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1018">will get the message and the fact that you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">registered a listener for a push message, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">your app will be woken up and told, "Hey, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1029">you know, something has happened and I'm sorry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1029">it's 3:00 a.m. but somebody did something." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">We also have an identity API. One of the biggest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">problems or most confusing things that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1038">have run into is identity management and authentication. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1038">And so we've built an identity layer into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">the Chrome packaged app system to help handle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1047">So we have an API specifically for Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">services, so when a user is signed into Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1052">&mdash; and on Chromebooks, they always are &mdash; they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1052">never see a login dialogue, right? All they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">&mdash; if you call the &mdash; the Google version of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1057">that API, you'll just get the user's identity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">and you're off and running. And we have another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">one for third-party services. And in the case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">of third parties &mdash; right? &mdash; there's a whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">dance that goes on, right? They get redirected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1073">to the app, they sign in, you know, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1073">a redirect URL that goes back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1078">So obviously it doesn't work in apps. So we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1078">built an API that does the same kind of thing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">right? You take the redirect URL, you get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">the token, and you're good to go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1089">So for example, the synchronized filesystem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1089">&mdash; right? &mdash; you can control what the conflict </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">resolution policy is. You can say, "Hey, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">last write is the one that wins" or it can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1100">be manual, right? You can simply manage conflicts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1100">yourself. And all you do is request the filesystem, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">which is the same kind of API that you would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">use in the open web, right? You'd get a &mdash; you'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">get a filesystem, a HTML5 filesystem back, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">and off you go. You just simply write your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">files. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">So for the identity case, what I was talking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1119">before about the two different APIs, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1119">them right there. So get auth token is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">Google version, and the other one there, launch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">web auth flow, is the one for third parties. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1132">Again, so we just &mdash; now, today, those APIs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">as of right now are in experimental, so they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">available in the Canary build and such in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1139">the dev channel. You can't currently ship </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">an application in the Chrome Web Store that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">uses experimental APIs but we expect these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">to be hitting the stable channel relatively </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1149">soon. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1152">All right. Let's talk a little bit about user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">experience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1160">So because these apps live outside the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">and they can have richer experiences &mdash; right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1168">&mdash; richer user interfaces, there are some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1168">things that go along with that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1173">So first, your app is responsible for things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1173">that it wasn't responsible for before when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1177">it was back in the browser. Users have different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1177">expectations of how an app is going to behave </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1183">versus a Web site, right? They just interact </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1183">with them differently. So the expectations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">are slightly different. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1188">So how do you do this? You build a great user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1192">interface. Number one, we give you a rich </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1192">windowing API to manage your app's windows. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1198">You can create windows. You can size them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1198">There are all kinds of events available to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1203">figure out when they've been changed, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1203">they've been moved, when they've been resized </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1207">and so on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1207">You can do things like use the screen size </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">to figure out what the initial size of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1211">window should be. So when the app launches, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">you can say, "Hey, how big is my screen," </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">do some calculations, center your window, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1221">make it as big as you want. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1221">You should remember where the window is, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">When the user closes the app and then they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">come back to it again later, they are not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">going to be happy with the fact that you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">recalculated everything. The reason why they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">set the window the way they wanted is because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1236">that's how they want their window, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">We've all done this. We get sublime text just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">the way we want it, right? And then we expect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1246">it to be there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1246">So in a browser, obviously, you can't do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1250">And users don't expect that. They expect the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1250">browser to remember how big it was. Your app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1254">is now responsible for things like that. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1254">can do things like decide whether you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">the operating system title bar. In the apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1259">I showed earlier in the demos, they didn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1264">have the native &mdash; the native title bars, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1264">right? They decided to show &mdash; to hide them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1270">So you can choose whether you want the title </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1270">bar or not. If you don't want it, you still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1275">have to let the user drag your app around. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1275">That's just a basic capability. So we support </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1279">the Webkit app region CSS property. All you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1279">do is set that on the element that you want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1286">to act as whatever the title bar is or the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1286">drag region. And we also give you methods </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1293">inside the windowing API to do things like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1293">handle maximize, handle minimize, right, figure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1298">out when you open and close, that kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1298">stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1301">So we also give you a way to do context menus. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1301">Again, this is an expectation that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">have of apps, right? I control click or I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">right click, whatever it is, I expect the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1311">context menu to come up. You can do that in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1311">your apps. We give you that ability. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1320">So I talked also a little bit about access </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1320">to the platform and hardware. And so you are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">able to get access to the platform via a bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">of different ways: Files, USB, Bluetooth. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1330">We have APIs for all of that. Sockets, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1330">can open raw sockets in your packaged app. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1338">So if you want to write the next great IRC </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1338">client, you can now do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1343">This, of course, has implications. Any time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1343">you give the user access to things like the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1349">hardware, right, security and privacy become </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1349">even more important now, right? Now it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1354">not just cookies anymore. Now it is like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1354">oh, I can discover devices around me and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">can get files and I can open up raw just data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1359">sockets and start exchanging data with, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1366">know, anybody I want. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1366">So it's important to remember that these issues </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1372">&mdash; you know, they become paramount when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1372">have these kinds of capabilities. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1376">I believe the wise prophet Spiderman's uncle </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1376">once said, "With great power comes great responsibility." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1385">Right? So remember that. So, be clear to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1385">user about when you're using platform resources. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1392">Now, in some cases you have no choice, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1392">The camera comes on. The little light goes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1396">on, right? I'm on air. So in that case, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1396">platform takes care of it for you. But you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">should be clear. Like, you should say, Hey, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">here's how much data storage you have used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1406">out of this many bytes. Hey, I'm currently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1406">communicating over connection with this other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">computer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1411">Hey, I'm using the USB to do this game pad. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1416">Or, hey, Bluetooth is currently enabled. Just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">give the user some indication of what's going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1420">on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1420">And, remember, that in many cases these are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1424">shared resources. So, again, this is an example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1424">of where your app is responsible for something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1430">that in the past it wasn't. You need to remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1430">to release things when you are finished using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1435">them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1435">All right. Let's talk a little bit about application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1441">security. So how many people are familiar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1441">with the content security policy or have heard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1448">of it? All right. Not many people, okay? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1448">So the content security policy is implemented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1454">inside of Chrome packaged apps. And I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1454">show you a URL where you can learn more about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1458">this. Basically, it sets up a whole set of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1458">rules for what apps can and can't do. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1464">we have a lot of rules that are intended to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1464">make applications a lot more trustworthy. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">We want these Chrome packaged apps to be thought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1470">of by users as really powerful but at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">same time safe, like, Web pages are today, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1476">right? People feel safe. They go to their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1481">browsers. They click on links, right? They </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1481">feel like they can do that without having </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1485">to worry about their machine blowing up, whatever. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1485">We want packaged apps to have that same kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1490">of trust that users have come to give Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1490">pages. So the first thing we do is we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">let you do things like eval, right? So don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">be eval. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1500">We don't let you do things like use new function </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1500">calls. All your JavaScript code has to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1506">in separate JS files, okay? You can't &mdash; you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1506">can't do things like inline event handlers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">and script blocks inside your HTML. That just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1512">doesn't work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1517">You can't embed iframes, right? We have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">Web view tag for that, and I will talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">that in a little bit. But iframes are verboten. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1522">You need to declare where your content is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1529">coming from if it is not coming from your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1529">local app. A great example of this is using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">Google Analytics. How many people use Analytics </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">in their apps? A bunch of you. Yeah. So that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1540">&mdash; by default, the content security policy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1540">will say, oh, you are trying to make a request </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1544">to a domain that's not part of your local </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1544">app here and so by default that won't work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1551">So what you need to do is edit the content </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1551">security policy for your application to say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1555">I'm allowed to go and get data from this domain. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1555">And the experience that the user will get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1561">when they install the app from the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1561">Web store will be, Hey, here's what this app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1566">can do, right? It can access data on this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1566">domain, and it can write files, and it can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1571">do these other things. So that's &mdash; it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1571">a hint to the user of what's going on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1576">So, again, just to reiterate the point. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1576">typically when you write a Web page, you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1582">see code that looks like this, right? I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1582">got my script block, my function. I have an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1587">event, says onload, do that. None of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1587">is going to work, okay? This is just simply </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1592">not going to work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1592">So what you need to do instead is put the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1595">code in an external file and then do things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1595">like get element by ID and whatever else and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">add event handlers on the fly, right? That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">a much better way of doing it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">So to embed Web content, this is, of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1606">one of the first questions that comes up: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">Well, then how do I do things like put stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1610">in a frame? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1614">We have actually built a Web view tag to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1614">this. So if you want to embed content in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">application, you can use the Web view tag. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1619">And the Web view tag gives you the ability </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1622">to do things like point at external URLs. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1622">And it gives you an event like, Hey, I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">finished loading the content. So that's how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1627">we solve that problem. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1632">For accessing remote resources, the only thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">&mdash; the only types of data that you are allowed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">to refer to that are not local to the machine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1637">in your apps are video and audio. So images </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">have to be local, right? You can't say image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">tag and then path to some image on the Internet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1647">If we go back to the example of The Economist, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1647">how are they doing that? Or 500 Pixels, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">are they doing that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1653">What they do is you use XHR to fetch the resources </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">from the remote location, store them in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1658">local filesystem Sandbox that you have. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">that's without permission, by the way. Your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1664">app has a local Sandbox for files that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">can just access till your heart's content, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1669">okay? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">So then once you have got that, you can refer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">to them, like, blob or data URLs. And, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">fact, this scenario comes up so frequently </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">that we built a remote access loader library </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">that will handle this for you. You simply </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1685">&mdash; you include the JavaScript code. You use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">the API and you're good to go. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">So then, of course, the question comes up: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1695">Well, what about templating libraries? Don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1695">they use eval? Don't they use new function? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">And the answer is yes. So what do you do? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1700">Well, you can use libraries that precompile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">their templates, right? So handlebars, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">example, you can precompile your templates. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1711">Other libraries do the same thing. So do that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1711">The one escape hatch that you do have from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1718">pretty much everything I have said for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1718">last five minutes, other than the doors over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1722">there on the side of the room, the one escape </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1722">hatch that you have is that you can say, "I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">want to run this particular page of my application </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">in what's called a Sandbox." So back in your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1733">manifest file, you can say you know what? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1733">I want to be able to use eval. I want to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1737">able to use new function. I want to be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1737">to use some weird template library that does </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1742">all the things you are not supposed to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1742">You can declare that that page lives inside </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1746">of a Sandbox, and that page is then part of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1746">your application but it is kept separate. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1751">You know, process-wise, it is kept separate. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">And then you can just use post-message to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1757">communicate between that page and the rest </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1757">of your app. Right? That's how we solve that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">particular issue. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1763">All right. So I have got about ten minutes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">left. I'm going to try to leave some time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1769">for questions. But let me sum up. So, remember, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1775">offline, by default, right, figure out what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1775">it is you want to make available. Keep all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">your stuff local, right? Identify what it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">is you want to make &mdash; you want the user to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1784">be able to do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1784">Cloud by default, we have a great set of APIs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">for working with cloud-connected apps. The </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">sync filesystem, the sync architecture, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">user experience, right? Your app controls </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1795">all of that. Your app controls whether it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1801">wants to look native or look like something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1801">people haven't seen before, how its windows </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1806">behave, and so on. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1806">Platform access, you can now have a real API </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1810">for USB, for Bluetooth, all that great stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1810">Security, remember content security policy, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1817">it defines how your app behaves. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1817">Keep all your code separate and use Sandbox </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1823">pages for things that are not safe. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1823">Let me just jump over back to my Mac for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1832">second, which has helpfully gone to sleep. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1832">Okay. So let's go back to the code and let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">me go back &mdash; actually, let me show you on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1842">our site, developer.chrome.com/apps, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">is where we have all the documentation for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">how to build these. So if you have any questions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1855">about how the APIs work, you know, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1855">all that documented here. We've also got a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">full list of the things that are native to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">the Web platform that we don't support for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">one reason or another. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">So, for example, plug-ins, right, Flash, et </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">cetera, no, no plug-ins supported, no local </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">storage, right? We don't do things like annoying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1876">alert and confirm dialogues. So all of that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1876">is gone. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1880">Yeah, some of these decisions we made for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1880">security reasons. Some of these decisions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1884">we made because, well, aesthetic reasons. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1884">The other thing I want to show you guys really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1890">quick &mdash; oh, yeah, I'm running Canary, by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1890">the way. So that's bound to happen more than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1899">once. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1899">So these are the Chrome JavaScript APIs. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">where the open Web has you covered, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">great. For places where the open Web APIs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1912">have not yet caught up or just don't make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1912">sense yet to have an open Web API, this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">where we come in and we give you the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">platform APIs. So this is where we provide </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">capabilities like the windowing and supporting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1924">things like the DevTools. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1928">And, remember, because these are Chrome packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1928">apps, because they're running on the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1932">platform, you get all the goodness of Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1932">How many people use the Chrome DevTools? All </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1937">right. Did you guys go to the DevTools unleashed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1937">session that was just &mdash; yeah. All of that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1943">awesome goodness that you get in the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1943">DevTools work here, too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1947">So while you're developing your app, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">bring up the DevTools, debug till your heart's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1950">delight, use all the great stuff that we give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1950">you in the DevTools. All the great stuff that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">comes in the Chrome platform you get because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">you're in the Chrome packaged app. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1959">So let me just take a quick visit over to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1959">the Chrome Web store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1966">So this is the Chrome Web store as it will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1966">look for you when you go there in the DevChannel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1971">Now this is on Chrome OS. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1971">Actually, I should probably switch over to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1974">it. Sorry. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1974">This is how it will look. You can see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1978">the existing hosted apps have been rebranded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1978">as Web sites, and the real packaged apps are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1985">now in the apps category. It actually has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1985">an apps category now. It never had one before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1990">And this is where apps will be available to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">the user. The experience that the user will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1994">get is that when they go to install an app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1994">right, if they don't have Chrome installed, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1999">we'll take care of putting the runtime on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1999">the machine for them. As far as they're concerned, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2002">it is a runtime. The app will show up in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2002">launcher like it does for any other app. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2010">that's the experience that they will get. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2010">Has anyone used inline installation for extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2016">before? No? Okay. A few people, yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2016">So one of the features we provide in the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2021">Web store is a feature called inline installation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2021">So just the same way that I can go to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">store as a user and get an application, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">as a developer can put a link on your Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2031">site that will trigger the installation process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2031">inside Chrome. And then from that point out, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2037">the user gets the same experience that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2037">would have gotten had they gone to the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2041">Web store. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2041">For example, if I choose to install an app, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2044">I will get a little dialogue that says, Hey, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2044">you really want to install this thing? This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2046">is how many stars it has. You can do the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2046">thing so the user never has to leave your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2050">site. It works today for extensions and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2050">hosted apps, and we are going to support that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2056">for packaged apps as well. It is a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2056">great distribution mechanism because it provides </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">a nice continuity of flow, right, for users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">coming to your site. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">Okay. One last thing I want to show you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">before I take questions. That is something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2073">that we've been working on. It's &mdash; how many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2073">people have opened up their Pixels and said, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2081">"Now, how would I code on this thing?" </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2081">Yes, almost everybody. Now, today we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">have a full-on local IDE. We're working on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">it. The DevTools can do some code editing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2095">There is some great online editors, Cloud </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2095">9, Nitrous, all those guys. We thought we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2100">might try our hand at providing an experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2100">of what code editing might look like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2107">Now I want to be clear. I'm not about to announce </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">any great product or anything. So you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2111">put your phones away. I'm not going to... </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2111">What I am going to show you, though, is we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">as the team sat down and said, What kinds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">of things would an IDE need to do? And then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2122">let's see if we can do that. And this will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2122">teach us what kinds of capabilities we need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">to give the platform. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2126">And so down here I've got an application called </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">code editor. And it is called that because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">the developer who has built it has had a ton </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2136">of marketing training. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2136">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2137"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: That's what it does. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2137">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2141"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: So... all right. So this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">it. This is the code editor project. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">is on github. And I will show you the repo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">in a second. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2151">The idea here basically is that &mdash; you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2151">see it has kind of got the Googlish UI. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2156">when I create a project, right, I can create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2156">a new project and I can call it, I don't know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2163">Joe's demo. And so I will create that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2163">And so when I do that, it fills out the skeleton </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">for me of the packaged app, right? So you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2170">can see here &mdash; I mean, I know the font is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2173">kind of small. I'm sorry. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2173">This is the manifest file that you're looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">at right here. Here is the main startup JavaScript </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">file. You can see here it is creating a window, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2185">right? You can see here it is following the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2185">practice I said before, you know, figure out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2189">the screen height and so on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2189">I've got things like &mdash; what do you call it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2194">&mdash; code hinting. If I say Chrome dot and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2194">control space, right? And so pretty cool. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2201">I have got this nice little tabbed interface. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2201">I can switch between my files. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2204">I can also just run this app. I should probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2204">get rid of the error first, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2210">Here's the HTML file. Here's a graphic that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2210">I am including in my app. You can see when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2216">I look at the graphic in the tool, it just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2216">shows you the image. So if I run this, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2222">will package it up on the fly, build it and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2222">then run it so I can do this edit, refresh, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2228">run cycle. You can see it says "hello world." </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2228">I will close that. I will go back into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">HTML and I will change that to say, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2233">"Hello I/O." Don't need to save. We will just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2240">run it again. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2240">Okay. That works. And so at some point, I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2245">going to be done with my app and then I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2245">going to want to put it in the Chrome Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">store. What do I do? I click export and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2247">will export this whole project as a zip file </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">which then just goes right to the Chrome Web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2255">store. This is something we are playing around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2259">with. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2259">The Google Chrome github repo is right here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2267">So if you want to help us out with any of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">this stuff, submit ideas, give us feedback, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2272">please do so. You can see here that we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2272">the Chrome app samples. So all of the APIs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2276">that I showed you before have corresponding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2276">samples in the Chrome app samples repo here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2283">on github. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2283">And that one &mdash; the aptly named code editor </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">app is right here. Let's go back. Okay. So, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2290">anyway... looks like I got two minutes left. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2298">So if you have any questions, feel free to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">come to the mic and ask them. Otherwise, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2303">will be up at the Chrome for questions bar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2303">hanging out there. I will be here all day </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">tomorrow as well. So if you have questions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2308">please feel free to come ask.

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2322"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: You can use Angular, yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2322"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Cool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2325">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2325"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: Oh, yeah, how embarrassing would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2329">that have been? Oh, there is this called CSP </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2329">and the Angular guys... </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2334"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Early on you joked that this wasn't the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2334">death of Web apps but when you showed the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">new Chrome Web store, it looks like it kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">of is because in order to be under the apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2343">category, you have to be an installed app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2343">and the rest of us will be relegated to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2347">called a Web site. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2347"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: Yeah, we had to choose branding. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2351">So we couldn't call &mdash; see, the problem is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2351">things like the word "hosted app" doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2354">mean anything to anybody. So we had to figure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2354">out what do we call these &mdash; these new things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2359">are apps. What do we call the old stuff? Before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2359">you rush the stage and just pummel me, just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">understand I did not make that decision. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2366">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2368"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: But, yeah, so &mdash; the future </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2368">is that, yes, what was called hosted apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2374">before will now live in the Web sites section. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2374">But they're still promoted. They're still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2379">there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2379"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Does that reflect a direction that Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2381">is heading, though? Will all of the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2381">Apps end up being packaged apps only? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2385"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: No, we still support hosted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2385">apps. They're still supported. We needed to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2390">make a clear distinction, and that's the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2390">we went. Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2393"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Do you have any plans to do anything with, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2393">like, the top task bar where you can, like, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2399">put an icon up there? Because sometimes it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2399">is more convenient instead of running it down, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2403">like on the OS? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2403"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: So, yeah, and similarly like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2405">a system tray icon and things like that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2405"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2408"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: So, yes, we have looked at these. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2408">Right now we are driving toward a stable 1.0 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2412">release. So we want to get the platform right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2412">Once we have done that, we will start looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">at things like polish and other things we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2416">can do with systems. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2420"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Cool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2420"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2423"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2423"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Can a Chrome packaged app use any of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">Chrome extension APIs? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2427"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: No. They can't use Chrome extension </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2433">APIs. What we have tried to do is in the case </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2433">where an extension API made sense in the apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2437">namespace, we decided to just make it available. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2437">We made an apps version of it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2442">But, again, for security reasons and other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2442">reasons, we can't use extension APIs. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2447"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2447"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: All right. Other questions? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2452"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: For an app that's internal to our company, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2452">is there a way to do deployment through an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2456">internal Web store? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2456"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: Yeah, there is. So we have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">notion of an internal Web store. So, for example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2460">if you have a Google App account, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2465">do automatic provisioning, yeah. So you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2465">do stuff like that, yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2470"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: You mentioned API supported Socket. What's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2470">the name of the &mdash; I could not find it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2477"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: So it might be in the trunk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2477">version of the docs. It's right here. It is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2481">the Socket docs right here, chrome.socket. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2481"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Chrome.socket? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2484"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: Right here. No, right there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2484">Hang on. Sorry. Right there. Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2490"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. It is not on the regular API. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2490"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: If you go to &mdash; it is down in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2496">the list. It is actually in the stable docs. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2496">If you scroll down the list, it should be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2499">listed there, yeah. Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2499">Yes? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2501"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So if I want to download that IDE and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2501">run it on the Pixel, do I have to download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2505">as a zip file from github? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2505"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: Yeah, you can. When you download </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2508">a zip file onto the Pixel &mdash; first of all, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2508">don't do this. The reason is because right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2513">now it requires the Canary to run. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2513">We expect that that will change &mdash; as the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2519">API that we're using makes it into the DevChannel </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2519">that will happen. So once that happens, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2523">download it as a zip file onto your Pixel. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2523">The way &mdash; the incredibly intuitive way that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2528">you unpack zip fills in your Pixel is you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2528">go into the zip file, you select all the files, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2533">you do a control-c, you go back to the filesystem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2533">and do a control-paste and that will unpack </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2537">the zip file. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2537">I saved you about five minutes of Googling. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2541">Trust me. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2541">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2559"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: So it runs &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2561"><span class="speakerName">Joe Marini</span>: No, it runs &mdash; no, you are not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2567">in the browser anymore. No, this is &mdash; what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2567">we have done is taken the Chrome runtime, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2570">factored it out from the browser. So now this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2570">is any other runtime like Java or dot net </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2574">or whatever. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2574">You build your app and as far as the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2577">is concerned, they are just running an app </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2577">on a runtime.
