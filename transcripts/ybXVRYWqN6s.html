<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/ybXVRYWqN6s">youtu.be/ybXVRYWqN6s</a><div id="transcript"><p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1"><span class="speakerName">Jonah Jones</span>: Hi everyone. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2">Thanks for coming. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">Today, Yatin and I are going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="4">give you guys a little talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">about the process we went </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">through when we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">redesigning the new Google Maps, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">as I'm sure you saw in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="12">the keynote on Wednesday. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">Hope you guys are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">enjoying this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="15">So, my name's Jonah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">I'm lead designer on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">new Google Maps. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="20"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: And I'm Yatin. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">I'm the engineering director. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">I led the team that built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="22">the new Google Maps. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="27"><span class="speakerName">Jonah Jones</span>: So, as we were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">going through this process of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">doing this redesign from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="29">the ground up &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">as Bernie and I mentioned when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">we were on the stage on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">Wednesday &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">there were three main concepts, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="35">and we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">do a deep dive on two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">of them today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="39">Now, one of them was that we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="39">build a new map with every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">click, and there are some quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">interesting, difficult </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">problems that we had to solve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="45">in order to do that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="47">And another one is that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">wanted to make sure that all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">of the imagery we have in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="49">world is very easy to discover </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">and fun and immersive as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="54">So we're going to go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">through those two. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="56">So, on the first one, let's talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">about how we build a map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">for every place. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="60">Now, one of the most important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="60">things in building this map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">for every place is highlighting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="63">and making sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">that we're labeling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">the right roads. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="67">And this is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="67">quite a challenging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">thing to get right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="71">So I'll tell you a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">story first. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="73">Which is that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">I like to travel a lot. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="76">And I think it's amazing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">we've got these digital maps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">nowadays, and we can carry these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">around in our pocket. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="82">And we can look at them on our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">computers and everything. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="84">But there's something missing a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">little bit from the old days </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">of having an analog map. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="89">So, this is an example of a map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="89">that was drawn for me when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">I first moved to Sydney </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">a few years ago. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="94">And you probably remember when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">you were traveling when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">were a little bit younger, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="97">maybe you went </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">and stayed in a hotel. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="101">And the hotel concierge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">would draw you a map. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="103">And he'd annotate on top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="103">of the existing map. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="106">So, maybe they'd highlight some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="106">of the roads that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">need to use to get to places </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">that you're interested in. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="112">They'd highlight </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">places for you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="114">And this map is great, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="114">it was a map that has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">drawn for you and is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">unique to you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="119">And it also is quite nice that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="119">it serves as a form of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">nostalgia afterwards. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="123">So after your trip is done, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">can take this out one year </span><span class="line" data-startTime="127">later and look back on it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="128">And we were wondering how we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">can build a map that feels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">customized to you, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="130">also fit for purpose. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="135">So, if we look at how Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">Maps looks today, you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">that this is a fairly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="140">reasonable, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="142">plain map of this area. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="144">This is actually close to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">my house in London. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="146">And if we wanted to draw a map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="146">of how to get to this park in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">the middle here &mdash; the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">Pullens Gardens &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">you could imagine that most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="151">traditional maps would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">probably just stick a pin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="153">inside the map and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">be done with it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="157">But that probably isn't the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="157">best map that we could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">possibly draw for this place. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="162">For a start, the two cross </span><span class="line" data-startTime="162">streets that you see right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">next to the Pullens Gardens &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="166">they're not even labeled. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="168">And that's perfectly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="168">reasonable. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="170">These are very small streets, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="170">and in the general scheme of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">things, these are not the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">important roads to label here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="176">But in the context of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">Pullens Gardens, these are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">super important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="180">And you can also see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="180">generally, there's just a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">of information. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="184">So even if we were labelling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">those streets, no attention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">would be drawn to those streets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="187">as being particularly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">important amongst all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">of the other streets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="192">that we've got nearby. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="194">Now if we were to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">a different approach. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="197">My wife actually just drew </span><span class="line" data-startTime="197">this map on a napkin. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="201">And you can see here that this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">is a vastly simplified </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">representation of how to get to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">the Pullens Gardens in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">middle here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="209">Now this might be a little bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">hard for you to read her </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">handwriting, so let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">me simplify this a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">little bit for you here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="215">This is my diagrammatic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">representation of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">information that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="218">showing on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">Pullens Gardens map here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="222">Now we've got several things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="222">we've left out and several </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">things we've left in here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="226">So, the first is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">major highways &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">the major thoroughfares of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="231">city I left in, because these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">roads are going to always </span><span class="line" data-startTime="234">be important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="236">Because they're context and part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="236">of the overall structure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">of the city. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="241">But the other thing we did was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">we drew Penton Place, Amelia </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">Street, Crampton Street, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">Illife Yard &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">all of these more minor streets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">that you need to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">to get to the Pullens Gardens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="251">from the major streets &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">we made sure that those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">were highlighted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">and labeled as well. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="258">And of course, we also drew &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">there's only one point of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="260">interest that's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">important for this one, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">is Kennington station. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="264">This is the local subway </span><span class="line" data-startTime="264">station that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">you'd need to get there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="266">But you could imagine that if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="266">there's other major landmarks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">nearby, perhaps where you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="270">going to be turning off the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">streets, they would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">be an important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">thing to show as well. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="277">So again, here's the map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="277">that we had before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="280">And now here's the map that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">draw in the new Google Maps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="284">Now, this isn't quite such a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="284">startlingly different change </span><span class="line" data-startTime="288">as you might first think. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="289">Because you might think, Oh, why </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">didn't they just draw the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="292">equivalent of this napkin map? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">But actually, that's not exactly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">what we want in a new, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">modern, interactive map, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">maybe you missed your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">turning, and you still need to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="299">be able to know what the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">roads are nearby for context. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="303">Or maybe you're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">drag the map away, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">zoom in, or zoom out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="306">So we still need a map that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">going to be useful in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">general case, but we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">to subtly highlight all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">these roads that are important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="311">and make sure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">they're labeled as well. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="316">So I'm going to hand you over to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">Yatin to explain how we did </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">this process of selecting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">the right roads. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="321">Because although it might be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="321">quite easy for one person to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">draw a local road for their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">local area, you can imagine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">that it's quite challenging to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">do this for absolutely any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">place in the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="330">So I'll hand you over. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="332"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: Thank </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">you, Jonah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="334">So, how do we go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">from this map &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">which is a very simple base map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="336">with a marker stuck on it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">for Pullens Gardens. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="342">This is what you normally see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">in the classic Google Maps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="345">How do you go from here to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="345">map that Jonah just showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="349">moments ago? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">Well, for starters, Google has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">access to a significant amount </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">of anonymized information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">about how our users &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">our millions upon millions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">of users &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">use Google Maps every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="362">single day. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="366">We can analyze all of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">information and use that to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">extract signals that allow us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="371">to figure out which roads to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">highlight on this map, for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">this particular location. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="378">And we can do that over and over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="378">again, every time a user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">looks at a map. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="384">So let's look a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">bit more. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="387">What information can we use in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">order to figure out which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">roads are important for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">Pullens Gardens? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">What I've shown here is every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">single Driving Directions that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">any user in Google has ever made </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">to the general vicinity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">of Pullens Gardens. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="405">So we look across all of our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">driving directions that users </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">do millions of times every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="409">single day, and figure out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">which of those driving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="414">directions are leading to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">general vicinity of Pullens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">Gardens, and created a map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="420">that looks somewhat like this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="422">Now obviously, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">is a lot of data. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="424">If I use this to highlight every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">single road that this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">map is showing in blue, that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">not really going to give me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">any more compelling of a map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">than what we had before. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="435">So what do we do next? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">Well, we can look at each one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">of these driving directions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">and start aggregating them to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">figure out which little bit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">road segment &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">how popular it is, and how many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">of our users are going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">use it to get to Pullens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">Gardens. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="454">So you can, again, analyze all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">of those Driving Directions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">for every road segment that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">leads from one intersection to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="461">the next intersection. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="462">You can figure out how many of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">those Driving Directions would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">have used that particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="465">segment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">to get Pullens Gardens. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="469">And once you do that, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">rank all of the roads based on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">the popularity that they have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">for getting to the location </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">that you want to highlight. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="479">And that's what this version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">of the map is showing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="482">The deep blue roads are the ones </span><span class="line" data-startTime="482">that were marked as more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">important, more relevant for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">getting to Pullens Gardens. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="489">The light blue ones are all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">the other roads that we had in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">the previous slide. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="494">So you're now starting to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">see a little bit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">structure to the map. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="497">I'm just going to take away all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="497">of the light blue so we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">can see this a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="499">bit more clearly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="502">At this zoom level, this now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">starts to look like a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">relatively clean and useful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">map for Pullens Gardens. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="510">It's starting to look very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">similar to those napkin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">sketches that Jonah was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">showing earlier. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="516">Let's zoom in a little bit more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="516">and see what that looks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">like at a closer zoom level. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="520">So here's what that same data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="520">looks like as you zoom in to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">be able to see the general </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">neighborhood </span><span class="line" data-startTime="527">around Pullens Gardens. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="529">And notice that those important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">roads are still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">highlighted. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="534">The roads that actually lead </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">directly to Pullens Gardens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">are also highlighted. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="538">So Penton Place and Amelia </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">Street are marked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="541">as important there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="542">But we're still missing some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">other important context around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">the immediate vicinity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">of Pullens Gardens. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="549">The cross streets that abut </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">either end of Pullens Gardens, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">those are not pulled out yet. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="555">So what the next step that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="555">algorithm does is it does a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">very localized search around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">the immediate vicinity of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">Pullens Gardens and starts to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">look for signals that might be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">relevant to highlight on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">map for Pullens Gardens. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="571">And what that ends up pulling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">out are these two smaller </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">roads that are not really that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="574">relevant for our Driving </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">Directions or walking directions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">from further away </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">coming down here, but they are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">really relevant as contextual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="583">information. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="584">When I talk about Pullens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">Gardens, I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="585">going to say, oh, yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="586">It's on Amelia Street </span><span class="line" data-startTime="586">between Illife Yard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">and Crampton Street. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="590">And that's what this ends up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="590">allowing us to pull out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="594">So you put all of this together </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">and you have the set </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">of roads that you might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">want to highlight. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="600">So now you have the base signals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="600">that you want to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="603">to create the map that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="603">Jonah showed earlier. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="608">Again, as he mentioned, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">don't really want to just show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="610">a map as desaturated as this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="614">You end up losing a lot of other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">contextual information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">that may be useful to some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">users, even though it's not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">the most useful information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">for this place. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="622">So how do you go about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="622">doing that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">Let's start again with the base </span><span class="line" data-startTime="624">map and just a marker. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="628">That's all we have. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="629">And now let's start pulling in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="629">the signals that we captured </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">in the previous slide. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="634">So the first step that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="634">algorithm does is it runs a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">restyling filter on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">this basemap. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="640">For every single road that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">picked out as an important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">road that we marked as blue in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="643">that previous slide, we will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">increase the intensity of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">color and the strokes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">used for that road. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="652">So I'm going to flip back and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">forth between these a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">of times so you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="655">it more clearly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="657">Here is what the basemap </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">looks like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="659">Here's what the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="659">map looks like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="661">Basemap. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="663">And new map. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="664">And what you see is that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">roads that are important have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">now become wider, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">the strokes have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">become darker and stronger. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="671">So they get pulled out a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">bit, but not so much as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="674">to be in your face. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="676">And the other thing you notice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">is all the other roads get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="679">dimmed out a little bit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="681">Those other roads are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">not as relevant. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="683">You don't want to take them off </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">the map, because somebody </span><span class="line" data-startTime="685">else might care about them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="687">You want to leave them on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="687">map, but reduce their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">intensity so that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">actually pull out the roads </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">that matter. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="693">So again, just one last time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="693">I'm going to show the previous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">thing, and the new one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="700">So this is step one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="700">You restyle everything. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="702">But notice that the streets that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">we thought were really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">relevant, like Crampton Street </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">and Amelia Street, are still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">not labeled on the map. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="711">So that's the next step that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="711">algorithm does is it runs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">a relabeling pass in real time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">as you've just clicked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">on this location, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="719">that gives you this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="723">So now, Amelia Street is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="723">labeled, Crampton Street is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="727">labeled, and we've made the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="727">label for Pullens Gardens a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">little bit bolder and stronger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">because that is obviously the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">most important label here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="734">Again, I'll flip back and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">forth once or twice. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="738">Here's what it looked like, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">here's what the new thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="740">looks like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="741">The other thing that the map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">does is it takes away some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">the labels on the less </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">relevant streets. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="747">So minor side streets that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">might have been labeled </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">earlier because there was enough </span><span class="line" data-startTime="750">space on the map to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">label them, we'll take away </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">some of those labels. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="754">Because those labels don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">matter nearly as much anymore. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="758">But the labels of the streets </span><span class="line" data-startTime="758">that are nearby that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">identified as important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">streets &mdash; they're really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">important, so we'll label </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">them more strongly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="766">So this, in a nutshell, is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">core set of algorithms that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">use to figure out how to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">a map that is truly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">about Pullens Gardens. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="779">And we take advantage of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="779">immense amount of computing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">power that we have at our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="782">disposal in Google's data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">centers to be able to run this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">algorithm every single second, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">for every single user, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">for every single </span><span class="line" data-startTime="792">task that they perform. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="795">The next thing we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">to talk about &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">I'm going to hand it back to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="797">Jonah &mdash; is to talk a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">bit more about how we explore </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">the world around us, around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="803">Pullens Gardens or one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="803">other places that you might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">want to search on the map. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="809"><span class="speakerName">Jonah Jones</span>: All right, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="809">thanks Yatin. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="810">So when I first joined Google, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">I was living in London, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">then I went and joined </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">the Zurich office. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="819">And so, I packed up my bags and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="819">went and traveled there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="822">And I was living in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">Zurich, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="824">was all very exciting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="825">And every Christmas, I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">come back, and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">would visit my family. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="830">And my grandma, at the time, she </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">was getting quite old, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">she wasn't really able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">to travel anymore. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="838">But she really wanted to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">know what it was like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">nearby where I lived. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="841">And she'd never been to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="841">Switzerland either. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="845">So this is a picture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">of Street View &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">and this is my house </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">in Zurich &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="850">and the amazing thing was from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="850">our living room or our kitchen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">in London, I was able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">go use Google Maps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="857">And we were able to fly to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">street level and go and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">explore the area around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">where I lived. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="863">And we called this going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">for a drive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="865">And this was incredible, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">because it gave her the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">ability to travel to Switzerland </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">and actually see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">this area where I lived. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="874">Now, my grandma's no longer with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">us, unfortunately, but if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">I had the ability to fast </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">forward and show her what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="883">we've done today, I think I'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="883">be really proud to show her </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">what we've done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="885">Because not only do we have this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">immersive Street View, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">also have this incredible Earth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">inside the browser, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">which lets you feel as if you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">flying all over the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">city in a helicopter. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="895">And we also have these amazingly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">immersive 3D tours. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="898">And this is actually a photo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">that I took of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">main river in Zurich. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="904">And the 3D tools are a really, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">really interesting part of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">this, which have very difficult </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">engineering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="912">challenges associated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="912">with them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="914">And we wanted to make sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="914">this wasn't a horrible, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">overwhelming, enormous </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">slide show. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="919">And we want to make sure that it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">was also more immersive and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">more engaging than just flipping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">through one photo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">after the other. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="925">So we used a lot of techniques </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">from cinematography to make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">sure that we picked the right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">photos and transition nicely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="931">between them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="932">And, again, as with that napkin </span><span class="line" data-startTime="932">map, this might be a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">fairly easy task for a human </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">to do if they were to do it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">one by one by one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="940">But if you're going to generate, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">using an algorithm, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">a great 3D tool for thousands </span><span class="line" data-startTime="942">and thousands of places for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">all over the world, this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">a pretty challenging task. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="949">So I'm going to hand it back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">to Yatin to explain how we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="951">went about doing this. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">So how did we go about building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1003">this 3D tour and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">other 3D tours like it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">Again, one of the big themes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">around how we went about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1014">building a lot of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1014">technologies behind the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">Google Maps is the immense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">amount of information that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">Google has access to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1022">So for 3D photo tours, the core </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1022">set of information that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">we started to look at is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">thousands upon thousands of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1032">photos that users like you and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1032">I and Jonah have uploaded to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">Google for public consumption </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1037">by everyone else. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1040">So this might include photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1040">that you might have uploaded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">to Google+ that you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1043">explicitly marked as shareable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">with the entire world, photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">that users might have uploaded </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1051">to the Panoramio photo sharing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1051">site, and any other similar </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1055">site within the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1055">ecosystem. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1058">So what this is showing you is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1058">just a sliver of the tens of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">thousands of photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">that we have of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1065">the Notre Dame cathedral. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">There's a whole bunch of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">photos, and what we want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">now do is figure out, how do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1069">take all of these photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1074">and go from them, and create a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1074">single photo tour out of them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1078">So the first step of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1078">entire process involves </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1082">running a long series of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1082">complex computer vision </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1086">algorithms that analyze this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1086">entire collection of photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1089">for the Notre Dame, and try to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1089">figure out exactly where that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">photo was taken in the real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">world, and where in the real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1098">world every single pixel in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1098">every one of these photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1102">corresponds to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1103">So for each pixel in every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">photo, we know exactly which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">other pixel in every other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">photo that particular one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">might correspond to. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">And what that allows us to build </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1113">is a fairly detailed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">three-dimensional model of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">the Notre Dame cathedral. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1121">And I'll show you what such </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1121">a model would look like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1125">So what you're seeing here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">what we call a 3D point cloud. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1129">It's a whole bunch of dots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">thrown into three-dimensional </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">space &mdash; and then I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">just captured a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">screen shot of that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">and what each of these dots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">represents is one point across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">the entire set of photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1141">that we identified. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">Each of these points identifies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">a point that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">matched in a set of pixels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1147">across all of these photos. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1152">And you can see, although the 3D </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">point cloud isn't complete, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">you can clearly see that this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">is a representation of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">Notre Dame Cathedral. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1162">So what do we do once we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1162">this 3D point cloud? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1165">The next step is, again, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1165">as I said earlier &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1168">we have on the order of tens of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1168">thousands of photos of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1171">Notre Dame. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1172">If I were to show you all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1172">those, that would look like a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">tour of your poor cousin's trip </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">that he took, and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1182">don't want to really sit through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1182">those 10,000 photos. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">So what we really want to pull </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1184">out is a handful of photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1187">that really represent, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1187">bring out the essence of what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1191">the Notre Dame looks like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1197">One thing we want to capture is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1197">what does the Notre Dame </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1203">look like in context? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">What does it look like in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">surroundings where it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1208">physically located? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1209">So that's one photo zoomed out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1209">far enough where you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">the entire cathedral. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1214">You see it's right on the main </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1214">river that runs through Paris. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1220">You want another one that really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1220">brings out what the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">cathedral is about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1226">So this is a front facade </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">photo of the cathedral. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1232">Each of these photos that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1232">picking, we also rank </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">them based on how popular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">they are. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">How many users have looked at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">that photo, How many people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">like that photo, and so on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1244">Here's the third photo. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1245">This really gives you a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">sense of detail that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1251">represents the cathedral. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1253">Again, this is the central arch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1253">in the front facade of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1257">the cathedral. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1258">And what this is capturing is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">one of the main aspects of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">cathedral that lots and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1262">lots of users are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1265">taking pictures of. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1267">Another thing you might want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1267">to capture is yet another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1270">perspective on what the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1270">cathedral looks like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1273">So you might want something that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1273">captures a photo from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1277">right hand side and then yet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1277">another one that shows you the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1280">right hand side facade of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1280">cathedral, as we saw at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1283">end of the tour. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1285">So this gives you somewhat of a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1285">sense of what the cathedral </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">would look like from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1288">various angles. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1291">But that's not quite enough to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1291">really give you an immersive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1296">sense of what the cathedral </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1296">feels like if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1300">were to visit it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1301">So another thing we look for is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1301">really picturesque photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1305">of the cathedral. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1306">And there's a number of signals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1306">that we can take into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1308">account when identifying photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1308">that are considered </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1312">picturesque. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1313">What this shows you is a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1313">beautiful nighttime view of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1316">the cathedral. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1316">The cathedral is beautifully lit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1316">up and really gives you a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1320">sense of a very different way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1320">of looking at the cathedral. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1323">What might be examples of photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1323">that you don't want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1326">choose for your photo tour? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1330">Here's a couple. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1332">Now, this photo on the left &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1333">it's a really beautiful photo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1333">of a bunch of flowers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1338">If you want to look at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1338">cathedral, it's not nearly as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1340">representative of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1340">the cathedral. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1342">You can see bits and pieces of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1342">the cathedral in the top left </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1346">corner, but they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1346">kind of blurry and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1348">not really in focus &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1350">it's not a very representative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1350">photo. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1352">And then that other photo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1352">on the right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1355">It's a wonderful family enjoying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1355">a great vacation in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1358">Paris, not something that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1358">representative </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1360">to this entire audience. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1362">So those are a few things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1362">we look for when we try to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1366">figure out which photos may </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1366">not be good photos as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1368">canonical photos. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1370">So now we have all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1370">of these photos. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1372">What those green dots around the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1372">3D point cloud are showing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1376">is the specific camera position </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1376">where that photo was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1381">taken from. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1381">And this is, again, something we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1381">can infer as we're building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1384">the 3D point cloud. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1388">So now we have a set of photos, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1388">and we know where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1391">those photos were taken from. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1393">What's the next step? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1395">What Jonah mentioned earlier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1395">when he was giving you a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">high level overview of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1398">photo tours is, we want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1401">take into account how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1401">cinematographers have really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1407">thought about how to navigate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1407">through a scene, create a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">camera motion model that really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1411">reflects that and gives </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1415">you a very smooth, fluid motion </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1418">throughout the entire scene. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1420">So we take all the canonical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1420">photos and arrange them such </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">that you can create a path from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1423">camera position to camera </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">position that feels very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1427">fluid and natural. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1430">And that's what this reflects. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1432">We're going from the photo on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1432">the bottom right all the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1435">around in clockwise direction. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1440">Let's take all of those and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1440">arrange them in sequence now. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1444">So that's what this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1444">would look like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1446">So if you only took this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1446">information and started to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">create a 3D slide show out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1449">this, you would end up with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1454">lot of artifacts. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1456">Going from the photo on the far </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1456">left to that next photo, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1459">nighttime photo of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1459">cathedral, you're going to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">a lot of stretching if you try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1463">to just warp one photo into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1466">the next photo. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1467">So what you want to do now is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1467">identify a few interstitial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1471">frames that you can use to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1471">really create a smooth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1473">transition effect. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1475">Now, what you know here is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1475">set of photos that you really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1478">want to linger the camera on. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1481">And then you just want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1481">identify a few additional </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">photos that you can breeze </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1483">through without </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1485">spending a lot of time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1486">And you know the general camera </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1486">path that your tour is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1491">going to take. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1492">So what you can now do is go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1492">back to your dataset of tens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">of thousands of photos and start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1495">looking for a few other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">photos that match that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1498">general camera path. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1502">And that gives you something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1502">like this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1504">Those red dots are the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1504">camera positions that we added </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1508">where we found a few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1508">interstitial frames, and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">added those frames to this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1511">entire sequence. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1514">Now these interstitial frames, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1514">they don't need to be terribly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1517">high quality. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1519">You can use fairly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1519">low-resolution photos and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1521">still be OK because they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1521">merely being used as filler </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1524">material as you're going from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1524">one photo that you're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">linger the camera on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1528">to the next photo. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1531">So you have a lot of flexibility </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1531">in being able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">identify photos that really give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1533">you a very nice, smooth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1536">transition. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1537">You put all of this together, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1537">and that ends up giving you a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1540">3D tour of the Notre Dame. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1544">We can do this not just for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1544">Notre Dame, but for any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1547">other landmark around the world, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1547">and we can do it not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1551">just for landmarks. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1552">So let's go back to the center </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1552">of Zurich where Jonah used to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">live and see a photo tour </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1559">of the center of Zurich. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1563">This is showing you a tour </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1563">around the Limmat River in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1568">center of Zurich. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1569">And it gives you sort of a nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1569">360 degree view of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1574">heart of Zurich. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1581">So this was a very quick </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1581">overview, but I hope you were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">able to get somewhat of a sense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1585">of what the underlying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1589">techniques are that go into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1589">building these 3D photo tours. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1593">So before I wrap up, I just want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1593">to go back and summarize </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1597">the two main things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1597">that we covered. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1600">The first one was, how do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1600">build a map of a place every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">single time, for every </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1605">single user? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1608">We use a lot of information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1608">that Google has access to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1612">about how places are structured, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1612">how people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">navigate to get to those places, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1616">to build these maps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1619">And the second is, once you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1619">figure out how to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1623">somewhere, you want to really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1623">get to know that place better. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1626">And so we have a number of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1626">different techniques that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1629">use to really give you a rich, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1629">immersive feeling for what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">these places look like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1633">in the real world. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1636">Now both of these techniques </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1636">that I described, they are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1639">very much in their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1639">infancy today. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1641">We think we've taken a very big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1641">leap forward with the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1644">Google Maps from what online </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1644">mapping can do these days, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">we still have a long </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1649">way to go forward. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1651">And we hope that you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1651">enjoyed what we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1654">shown you so far. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1656">We believe there are a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">still very hard, difficult </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">computer science problems to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1660">solve that will keep making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">these experiences better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1663">and better over time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1665">And we hope you will continue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1665">on the journey with us as we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">try to make a mapping experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1668">that is truly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">unique, truly for you, and truly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1671">about every single task </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1675">that you do every single day. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">With that, I think we'd like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1678">to open it up for any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1681">questions you might have. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1682">There is a pair of microphones </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1682">here that you can walk up to, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1686">and we'll be able to take any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1686">kind of questions and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1689">not drop the mike. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1694">[APPLAUSE] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1703"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: I wondered when do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1703">think we might see the new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">personalized maps showing up on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1705">mobile, on Android AND iOS? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1710"><span class="speakerName">Jonah Jones</span>: So the thing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">we talked about during the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1714">keynote on Wednesday was that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1714">we kind of came up with this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">vision of how the future of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1717">Google Maps would be as we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1722">moving forward. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">So the thing that we announced </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1723">on desktop on Wednesday was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">the desktop incarnation of where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1726">we're heading towards in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1729">that future, and I think that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1729">as time progresses, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">going to generally see this kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1732">of experience be mirrored </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">across all different devices, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">because we want everyone to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1738">have a very seamless experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1738">across all devices. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1741">So the desktop is a preview </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1741">of where we are now. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1744"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1744">what we have now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1745">is the desktop version. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">We will continue to work on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1747">improving our look and feel of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">Maps and unifying them across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1751">all of our platforms. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1757"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: In terms of how the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1757">new mapping system relates to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1760">the old mapping system, how much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1760">extra does it cost you in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1762">terms of compute power </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1762">to do this? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">And is there any saving in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1764">terms of data flow from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">cutting down these maps? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1772"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: I can't go into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1772">a lot of specifics on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1774">exactly what is different, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1774">we take advantage of a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">different levels of both </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1780">simplification and easier and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">better serving systems to allow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1785">us to build these maps. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">So, obviously, creating a map </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">on the fly for every single </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1794">user, every single task that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1794">they perform, is going to take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1797">more computing power. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">But we try to be fairly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1799">efficient about how we go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1802">about doing it so it doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1802">become an overwhelming thing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1805">Even for Google, we do want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1805">be conscious about not using a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1808">lot of compute power, so we try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1808">to be fairly efficient. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1812"><span class="speakerName">Jonah Jones</span>: There's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1812">distinction between, of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1814">course, client side computing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1814">power and the server side </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1816">computing power as well, so in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1816">terms of the download that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1819">get to your local machine, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1819">the amount of data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1821">we send should be &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">for the basic map case &mdash; should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">be similar or even less </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">because it's more efficient </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1825">with sending vector maps. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1827"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: That is true. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">Because we send vector data down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1828">to the client, now the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">total amount of data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1831">that we send to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1833">client is much lower. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">And we can take advantage of all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1835">of the compute power that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">each of you have to draw </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">the map for us. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1841">So that becomes a shared </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1841">responsibility where we do all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1846">the hard work in our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1846">infrastructure and then send </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1848">very simple information down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1848">to the client and allow the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1850">client to render stuff. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1853"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: I think one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1853">most interesting things was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1856">the way you guys did the WebGL </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1856">rendering in the browser. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1859">And reading the media coverage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1859">about this, it doesn't seem </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">like anybody noticed that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1864">I was wondering if you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1864">talk a little bit about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1865">challenges of doing that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">I'm specifically interested in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1866">how you're able to share that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">code across all the different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1870">platforms you're supporting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1872">including Android and iOS. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1874"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: So the WebGL </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">stuff that we worked on is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1879">primarily for desktop. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1880">The vector maps that our mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1880">platforms use, use a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1884">native variant of it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1885">We do try to share a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1885">themes across all of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1890">platforms, so we have the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1890">look and feel for the Maps no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1893">matter which platform </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1893">you're browsing on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1895">So when it comes to a bunch of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1895">the 3D rendering, we share a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1900">number of the low level shader </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1900">code that each of these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">platforms rely on, but then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1904">WebGL, iOS, and Android have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">their own variants of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1909">implementation on top of that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1913">that are native to the platforms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1913">that we work on. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1920"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: So what you showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1920">here is a very cool, but you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1922">said it is still in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1922">an early stage. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">What I'm curious to know is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">what are the major areas you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1929">see that needs to be enhanced? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1934"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: Be enhanced? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">Sure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1938">There's a lot of improvement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1938">we can make to our product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1941">every single time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1943">We are very proud and very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1943">happy about how far we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">come, but there is so much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">more that can be done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1950">A map that is truly about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1950">you continues to evolve. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1954">As I evolve, as you evolve, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1954">we expect out of online </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1961">maps evolves. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1962">We're going to continue </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1962">to want to improve it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1964">So we see this sort of as just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">one step forward in what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1969">people will come to expect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1969">out of online maps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1972">As people get to used to this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">new way of exploring the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1976">world, there will be newer and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1976">newer things that we'll want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1979">to do with our maps. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">There's a number of interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1981">ideas that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1982">hopefully we'll be able to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1982">with the world as we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1985">start building those and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1985">creating an even richer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1989">experience. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1990"><span class="speakerName">Jonah Jones</span>: Yeah, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1990">it's a really interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">challenge, because the two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1992">things that we showed today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1995">are kind of trying to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1995">algorithmically generate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">something that a talented human </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">would be able to do, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2000">that's really tough, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">So I feel like the fact that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2001">we've got as far as we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">with the 3D tool is amazing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2005">but that's still &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">if it were a human doing it, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2008">would become a mediocre 3D </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2010">tour, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2010">And wouldn't it be amazing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2010">if the 3D tour could be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2012">incredible like one of the top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2012">directors has done it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2014">And very similar with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2014">the hand drawn maps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2016">I think it's amazing how far </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2016">we've come, but there's still </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2019">a long way we can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2019">go with that. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2025"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Do you have a fixed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2025">database of landmarks for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2027">which you generate the 3D tours, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2027">or is it just possible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2029">for anyone to ask for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2029">3D tour of any place, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">essentially, on the planet? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2034"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: We &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2035">it varies. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2036">So, we can create the 3D tour of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2036">any place for which we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">a large number of photos. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2042">You do require a reasonable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2042">number of photos. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2044">If you only have five to 10 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2044">photos, you can't really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2047">extract a rich enough 3D </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2047">structure out of that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2050">But once you have enough photos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2050">of a place, then it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2053">pretty easy to create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2053">a 3D tour of that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">Now, obviously, we don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">anything in our current </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">product that allows you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2059">just create a 3D tour of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2062">something that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2062">generate, but &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2064">so what we take into account </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2064">are signals like, what are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2067">places that are going to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2067">interesting to our users, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">are the most relevant places </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2070">for, say, any given city </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2073">around the world, and try to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2073">take those signals into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">account when we figure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2076">out where we want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2078">publish these 3D tours. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2080">But the basic concept &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">if you took 1,000 photos of your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">house, you would be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2086">to create a 3D tour </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2086">of your house. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2088"><span class="speakerName">Jonah Jones</span>: If everyone in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2088">this room went outside and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">took a photo of the Moscone </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2090">Center, we'd probably have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2092">Moscone Center tour </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2092">pretty soon. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2094"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: So do you choose these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2094">places manually, or is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">there some algorithm that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2096">chooses those places? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2098"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: No , we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2098">choose them manually, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2100">algorithmic, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2100">many, many tours </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2102">around the whole world. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2104">So, yeah, there's a whole bunch </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2104">of algorithms and a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">number of signals </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2106">that go into it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">Basically, at a very high </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2107">level, it's driven by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2110">popularity. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2111">The most popular places we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2111">want to create tours for. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2116"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Somewhat related to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2116">the previous question, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">you're looking at all these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2118">thousands of photos, is there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2120">some level of manual filtering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2120">that you do with the photos, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2123">as well, or is it purely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2123">algorithmic? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2125"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: The first pass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2125">is purely algorithmic. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2127">We do perform some manual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2127">moderation to verify that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2132">algorithms work well. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2134">That will go down over time as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2134">we gain more confidence and as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2137">we gain more signals to feed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2137">into our algorithms. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2141"><span class="speakerName">Jonah Jones</span>: I think there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2141">quite a lot of manual work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2145">that goes even before this as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2145">well, right, because the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">photos that are selected are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">popular ones for Panoramio </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2150">or from Picasa. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">And something being popular is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">obviously a very, very human </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2155">thing which is, people like it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2155">they share it, all of that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">kind of thing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">So there is very much a human </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2158">element in the beginning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2160">[INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2160">about the popularity, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2160">then the algorithm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2163">takes over from there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2163"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: And that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2163">manual work is taking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2166">advantage of the immense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2166">human computing power </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2169">of the entire world. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2174"><span class="speakerName">Audience</span>: Just to touch back on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2174">the idea that if I was to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">take 1,000 photos of my house, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2177">a 3D tour could be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2181">created around it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">Is that a service that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">might want to offer to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2186">amateurs like me, that I could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2186">plug a bunch of photos in and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2190">it would do that for me? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2191"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: It sounds like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2191">a great idea, we'll have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2193">take it into account. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2199">Any more questions? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">I don't think there's anything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2205">else here, but &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2214"><span class="speakerName">Jonah Jones</span>: We're lucky that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2214">didn't happen in the keynote. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2215">[LAUGHTER] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2217"><span class="speakerName">Yatin Chawathe</span>: All right, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2218">thing has the old password. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2220"><span class="speakerName">Jonah Jones</span>: All right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2222">It looks like that's all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2222">questions then, so, thank you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2224">everyone for coming. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2225">[APPLAUSE] </span></p></div>
