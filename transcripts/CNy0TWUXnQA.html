<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="301"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Welcome to Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="301">Developers Live. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">I'm Louis Gray from GDL, joined </span><span class="line" data-startTime="303">today with two great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">guests from the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">Chrome team to talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="308">about Chrome Academy. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">It's a brand new event coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">to Google this year. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">We're here based in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">Mountain View. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">So I want to just start it off </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">by introducing Peter Lubbers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="316">and Allison Roarty. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">Thanks for joining me. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="318"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="320"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Now Chrome Academy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">is, as I mentioned, new. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">It's the first time we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">ever done this. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">And it's really taken all of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">your time the last week, few </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">weeks past. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">Maybe you can give our viewers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="328">on the live stream an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">understanding of what Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="330">Academy is all about. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="333"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: Absolutely. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">So Chrome Academy is a week-long </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">development program </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">for university students </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">who are rising </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">sophomores and juniors. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">And we're bringing them here to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">Google for a week to teach </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">them about building web-packaged </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">Chrome apps. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="348"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: OK. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="348"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: Well, of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">course, we're super </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">excited about it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">It's been a lot of fun </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">already this week. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">But we also want to show you a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="356">little bit of the reactions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">from the students themselves. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">And we created a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="359">video for them. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="362"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Cool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="372"><span class="speakerName">John Moore</span>: I was looking for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">internships for this summer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">around spring break of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">year, and I saw that Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">had a number of programs that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="380">students, rising sophomores </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">and juniors, could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">be involved in. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">I saw Chrome Academy, and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">really caught my attention. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="387"><span class="speakerName">Catherine Mullings</span>: I did a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">summer program last summer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">called Google Computer Science </span><span class="line" data-startTime="390">Summer Institute. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">And there they really introduce </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">students to HTML, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">JavaScript, App Engine, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="396">all these resources. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">And just being there for three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">weeks, I really enjoyed the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="403">culture that everyone brought. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">Everyone was so excited to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="405">build new technologies. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">And so I just thought I should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">be at Google again. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="410"><span class="speakerName">Calvin Chan</span>: I believe it all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">started with one of the career </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">fairs at UCLA. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">I heard about it, and I went </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">there to check out a few of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">the companies that were trying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="416">to entice students to apply </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">for opportunities. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">And I saw the Google booth and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">talked to one the recruiters. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">He introduced me to several of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">the Google programs, and I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">specially interested in Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">Academy because I started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">developing websites during </span><span class="line" data-startTime="433">high school. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">And it's definitely something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">that I'm very interested in. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="438"><span class="speakerName">Jonathan Poon</span>: I'll just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">go ahead and apply. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">And then luckily, I got in. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">So I was really excited to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="442">be part of this program. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="444"><span class="speakerName">Cara Kessler</span>: I would say that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">my favorite part of the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">Academy experience so far has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">been the instructors that I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">met and that I've gotten </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">to speak with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">on a personal level. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">Before we came to Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="452">Academy, we were encouraged to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">brush up on our skills </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">a little online. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">So I did the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="456">DevTools school. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">And when I clicked on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="458">introduction video, there was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">Paul Irish explaining how great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="460">Chrome DevTools are. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">And then three days later, I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">at Google, and there's live </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">Paul Irish. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="467"><span class="speakerName">Calvin Chan</span>: I think one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="467">the coolest things about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">Chrome Academy is that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="470">personally am interested in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">the type of courses that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="474">are being offered here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="477"><span class="speakerName">Jonathan Poon</span>: I think it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">mainly just all the people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">that I've met. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">They were all very passionate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">about what they're doing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">especially about web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">development. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="485"><span class="speakerName">John Moore</span>: Out of everything, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">I like the people that I've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">met more than anything else. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="491"><span class="speakerName">Catherine Mullings</span>: I guess it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="491">the professors that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">bring in and all these big gods </span><span class="line" data-startTime="493">in the industry, and how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">they have all these resources </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">that are coming together, just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">putting everything and making </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">all these connections, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">just feeling the creativity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">that comes with that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">It's just really exciting. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="508"><span class="speakerName">Calvin Chan</span>: One of the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">things we discussed as a team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">is what technologies we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">wanted to use and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">incorporate in our app. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">And we all decided that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="514">wanted to use stuff that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">learned here at Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">Academy. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="519"><span class="speakerName">John Moore</span>: One idea that we had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="519">was to kind of have some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">sort of interactive whiteboard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">service that could serve as a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">learning platform. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="530"><span class="speakerName">Cara Kessler</span>: And we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">implementing WebSockets, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">all of our information </span><span class="line" data-startTime="532">is live. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">And when you take a picture, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="535">you click upload on your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">phone, and it's live on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">computer screen waiting for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">you when you get back. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="540"><span class="speakerName">Jonathan Poon</span>: In our projects, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">we use several HTML5 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="543">technologies, such as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="543">WebSockets, that allow us to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">have real-time notifications </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">between all the users of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">application. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">And also, we use getUserMedia </span><span class="line" data-startTime="550">and also for geolocation, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">users can easily take pictures </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">and upload them to the server </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">and also know exactly where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">they took the pictures. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="560"><span class="speakerName">Calvin Chan</span>: So we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">implemented some aspects of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">web components and shadow DOMs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">using the new Polymer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">technology by Google. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="568"><span class="speakerName">Cara Kessler</span>: So this has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">definitely been an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="569">unforgettable week. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">There are a lot of things I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">to bring back with me. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">I took a course in web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">development at school this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">year, and I did learn a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">cool stuff, but nothing as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">exciting and cutting edge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="578">and new as the stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="580">I've learned here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="581"><span class="speakerName">John Moore</span>: I'd have to say that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">it's one thing, I think, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">to read about Google and its </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">company culture and its </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">company's mission online or to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="587">hear about it third-hand, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="594">friend of a friend. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="596">It's a completely different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">experience to have come here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">and seen it first person to, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="599">have experienced it, to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">eaten the food, taken the tours, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">talked with the people. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="608">I mean, it was just crazy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="609">I remember the other day, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="609">think it was yesterday, one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">the groups was working with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">Google Maps on their project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="615">And they had a question. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="616">And I think it might have been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="616">you, you said, oh, well if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">have a question, we'll just go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">get someone from the Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">Maps development team to come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="621">answer your question. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="623">And I was like, wow, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">no big deal, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">Google Maps development team. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="627"><span class="speakerName">Cara Kessler</span>: I learned HTML5 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">with the guy who wrote the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="629">book on HTML5. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="630"><span class="speakerName">Calvin Chan</span>: One of the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">inspiring talks we've had this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">week was from Colt about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">performance. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="637">And that really hit me because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">on campus, I'm part of online </span><span class="line" data-startTime="640">journalism. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="641">And we focus a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">on delivering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">content that's reliable. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="647">And when he talked about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">fact that users usually leave </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">a page after three seconds, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">that really hit me. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="654">Like, we can definitely increase </span><span class="line" data-startTime="654">our traffic to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">"Daily Bruin," which is the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">student journalism at UCLA. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="661">We can increase traffic to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">website just by increasing our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">performance and decreasing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="664">our load times. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="666">So I will definitely take what I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">learned in that talk back to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">campus and try and improve </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">what we do there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="673"><span class="speakerName">Jonathan Poon</span>: What I would tell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">someone who's thinking of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="675">applying is, just do it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">It's a one in a lifetime </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">experience, and it's awesome. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="681"><span class="speakerName">John Moore</span>: So if you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">considering applying to Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">Academy, I would encourage you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">to, as cliche as it sounds, go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">ahead and submit your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">application. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">Because I think that Google sees </span><span class="line" data-startTime="690">potential in everyone. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="695"><span class="speakerName">Cara Kessler</span>: I would say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">definitely apply. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">Don't worry about this only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">being a week and it taking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">away from your job opportunities </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">for the rest of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">the summer because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">this is Google. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">And I have a job waiting for me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">back home, but I'm taking a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">week off because this is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">a once in a lifetime </span><span class="line" data-startTime="708">opportunity. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">And you will learn more here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="709">than you will possibly in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">semester at your university. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">And just go for it, and you'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">be happy in the end. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="730"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: That was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">an excellent video. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="731">It's really good to hear </span><span class="line" data-startTime="731">directly from the students who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">have done the work at Code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">Academy and hear from them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="735">themselves. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">So I appreciate you taking the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="736">time to have their input right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">into the show. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">So thank you very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">much for that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="741"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: Definitely. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="741"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: So when I take a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">look at Chrome Academy, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">did you come up with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">this idea? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">This is the first time, so there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="745">had to have been an aha </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">moment to really get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="747">this started. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="749"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">Well, essentially, there's a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="749">of really exciting things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">happening in the Chrome world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">right now, and here at Google, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">we are really passionate about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="755">developing students and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">exposing them to new cutting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">edge web technologies. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">And we figured that Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">Academy would be a really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="765">great way to do that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="767"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: And what are they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="767">learning about this week? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="769">Is it open standards? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">Is it the web as a platform? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">There's really so many different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="771">things we can talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">about with Chrome that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">talked about on GDL. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="775"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: Right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="775">Exactly. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="776"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: So what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">going on? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">They've got like three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">days, right? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="778"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: No, it's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">the whole week. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="779">So the students came </span><span class="line" data-startTime="779">on Sunday night. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="781">They were flown in from all over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">the United States, from, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">like we said before, the rising </span><span class="line" data-startTime="786">sophomores and juniors, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">from colleges everywhere. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="791">And so they came in, did some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">fun activities, and they were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">shown the campus and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="796">Google store and lots </span><span class="line" data-startTime="800">of other fun stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="801">And then on Monday, we started </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">the actual program. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="803">And so the program is actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="803">made up of sort of three </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">different components. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="806">The first one would be actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">learning some of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">new technologies. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="810">So we're exposing them to things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="810">like the latest web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">technologies, latest HTML5, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">Polymer, shadow DOM, some of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">the new languages like Dart </span><span class="line" data-startTime="822">and lots of other exciting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="828">technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="829">Paul Irish was doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="829">a demonstration of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="831">the developer tools. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="832">But really, the latest and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="832">greatest that people might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">have seen at I/O, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">that's about it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="836"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Now I know it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="836">been a few years since I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="839">graduated college. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">But I don't remember shadow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">DOM or any of these things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">being part of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">CS curriculum. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="844"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: Exactly. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="844"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: How would you say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="844">that Chrome Academy introduces </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">new concepts to the students? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="849">Are these things that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="849">they're learning in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="850">universities already? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">What's being taught and what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">not being taught that we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="854">kind of filling the gap on? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="855"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: Yeah, and I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="855">think that's part of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">program that is the mission </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">behind the program, is really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">to introduce them to the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="860">that we would like them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">to already know that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">they're just not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">getting yet in college. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="866">I mean, these things are so new, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">to give a little bit of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">credit to the universities, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">could not possibly have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">curriculum on it because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">it just doesn't exist. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="874">But here, we can iterate on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">that curriculum very fast. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="877">And we've just built a two-hour </span><span class="line" data-startTime="877">code lab on using web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">components in Polymer that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">literally was done for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">very first time by the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">students here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="887">So it's pretty exciting. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="888">They really get to hear from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">the people developing the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">specifications, the people that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">are writing the code, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">the things that are just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">barely checked in. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="897">So it couldn't possibly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="897">be in any other sort </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">of curriculum yet. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="900"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Right. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">Some of the newness, I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="901">it actually presents a real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="903">opportunity. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">When you write for the web, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="905">you have that kind of open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">standard where you know you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">can write it once, and it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="908">really runs on any platform. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">And in the last few decades, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">you've seen this transition </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">away from software-based </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">platforms, where you write </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">once, and it works on a specific </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">operating system. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">Are students really grokking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="919">that idea and that idea of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">that portability, and seeing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">the opportunity there? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="924"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">more and more. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">One of the interesting things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">that I've found is in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">past, I've done a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">training in HTML5. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="931">And we would refer to how it was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="931">bad in the past and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">give an example of, well, how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">the HTML5 technologies would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">make it better. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">But what's interesting with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="940">these students, they've never </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">really seen those old, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="943">bad ways of doing. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="947">So they're actually starting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="947">out fresh. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">And it's great to start with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">some of the newer technologies </span><span class="line" data-startTime="951">that are abstracting a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="951">of these problems. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">And basically, it's a much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="953">better experience when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="957">don't have to think of all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="957">the things in the past. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="959"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: It's kind of like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="959">you say, the best way to stop </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">a bad habit is to never get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">it in the first place. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="962"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: Exactly. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="964"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: And so they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">starting exceptionally clean. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="965">It's a very interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="965">concept. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="967"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: And I think </span><span class="line" data-startTime="967">actually even better here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">than, let's say, starting the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="970">bad habits back with a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="974">two-year-old curriculum. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="976"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: Absolutely. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">Now, the Chrome Academy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">students themselves. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="979">Is this for engineers only? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="980">Is it for sophomores </span><span class="line" data-startTime="980">and juniors only? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">What's the criteria to get in? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="984">How did we find these people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="984">in the first place? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="986"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: So right now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="986">it is only for rising </span><span class="line" data-startTime="989">sophomores and juniors. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="992"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: In college. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="992"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: In </span><span class="line" data-startTime="992">college, yes. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">And we generally target students </span><span class="line" data-startTime="993">who are computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="995">science majors. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">But for Chrome Academy in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="996">particular, we look for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">students that were strong in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">HTML and JavaScript and CSS. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1002">So really, anyone who has those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1002">skills, regardless of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1006">their major, could apply and be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1007">considered for this program. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1009"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: The Google hiring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1009">process for full-time jobs has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1012">traditionally been exceptionally </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1012">challenging. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">We get written up on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1013">it all the time. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">And we know that's a great way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1015">and a great threshold to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1018">exceptional people to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1018">join the company. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">What kind of recruiting process </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">and what kind of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">application process do the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1023">students have to do? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1025">Did they have to write code in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1025">advance or say that they've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1027">learned specific skills? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1028"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: For Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1028">Academy, we ask for their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1031">resume and transcript. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1032">So we're interested in what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1032">college courses they've taken </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">already and how they've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">been doing there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1036">We did ask them three essay </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1036">questions, short essays. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1040"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: That </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1040">was my idea. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1042"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: And we also ask </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1042">for a link to GitHub or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1045">wherever they're housing any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1045">work so that we can look at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">work that they've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1047">already done. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1048"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: And I assume a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1048">of the students probably don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1050">want to leave Google now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1050">that they're here. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1051"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: That's true. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1052"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: And so how have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1052">we thought about that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">How do you get these sophomore </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1053">and junior students who need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1056">to go back and complete </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1056">their degree? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1058">Is this something where they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1058">have a fast track into a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1060">Google internship program? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1062">What's the end goal there? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1063"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: Yeah, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">definitely. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1065">And that's what we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1065">incorporated career </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">development components to Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1067">Academy as well, so the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1070">students have career panels </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1070">where we brought in not only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1075">junior and senior Googlers but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1075">interns as well, who they had </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1078">the opportunity to then ask </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1078">them questions about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1081">interview process, what's an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1081">internship like, what do you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1084">wish you knew when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1084">were in my position. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1086">We also are doing mock interview </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1086">sessions with them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1089">so that they can go through an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1089">actual real Google technical </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1092">interview and get a sneak peek </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1092">into what that's like, what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1095">look for, so that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1095">have a better </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1097">idea for how to prepare. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">And we're hoping that all 29 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">students will apply for an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1102">internship with Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1102">this fall. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1104">That's definitely our goal. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1105"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: The internship's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">coming up a lot this summer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1107">for some reason. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1109">But I'm hoping we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1109">able to get back to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">how it really works. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1112"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: The real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1112">internship, yes. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1114"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: See the movie. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">It's fun. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">But there are some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">differences, as I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">always like to say. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1118"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1118">do have pudding. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1119"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: That </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1119">might be the only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">thing that is the same. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1121"><span class="speakerName">Louis Gray</span>: And the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1121">food is free. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">But there's other development </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1123">programs for students beyond </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1125">Chrome Academy. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1126">Can you explain what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1126">those are? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1128"><span class="speakerName">Allison Roarty</span>: Sure. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1128"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: Yeah, there's one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1128">that's pretty exciting for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1130">high school students. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1132">For seniors in high school, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">there is the Computer Science </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1135">Summer institute, CSSI. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1137">So that's a great way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1138">And in fact, a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1138">of the students &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1140">I'm not sure of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1140">exact breakdown &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">that are in Chrome Academy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">were previously in CSSI. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1146">So it's a great track. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1148">That's a three week program </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1148">where, again, they get flown </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">to Google and have the whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1152">Google experience, but also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">very code-heavy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1157">And one thing I didn't mention </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1157">earlier was we're not just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">lecturing them on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1160">technologies. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1163">That would be boring. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1165">I mean, it would be exciting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1165">but hours </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1168">and hours of lecture. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1168">It's &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1384"><span class="speakerName">Peter Lubbers</span>: They should be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1384">there in another capacity. </span></p>
