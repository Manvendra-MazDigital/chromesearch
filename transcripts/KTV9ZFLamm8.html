<p><span class="line" data-startTime="9">Hello, and welcome to another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="9">episode of GDL-IL &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">GDL Israel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="14">Today, we're going to speak </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">about Big Query and Apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">Script, and how you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">leverage those two amazing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">powerful technologies in order </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">to get some clever insights on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">your own big data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="27">Now I didn't prepare any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">slides today, because I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">thought code would be a much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">more appropriate tool for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="36">crowd of developers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="37">So without further ado, let me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="37">share my screen with you, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">show you what we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="42">going to do today. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="48">So first of all, we're jumping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="48">right into the things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="51">But maybe we'll take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="51">a step back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="53">And we'll open another tab here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">just to show you what we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="58">are talking about. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="63">Yes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="65">And when we're talking about Big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="65">Query, the best source to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">start and try to understand what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="71">we have on our heads is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">the ability to gain insights </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">from your big data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="79">And when we're saying "big </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">data," we're speaking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">gigabytes, or terabytes, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">or petabytes of data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="86">And anyone that works in, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">say, a startup, mid-size </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">company, or a bigger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">organization, knows that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">there's lots of logs, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="92">lots of data, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">that is sitting somewhere. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="95">And there are true gems </span><span class="line" data-startTime="95">in this data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="99">And basically, it's quite hard, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="99">in most of the cases, to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">ask the right questions, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">to get a response in a time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="107">that will make sense. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="109">Luckily, Google Big Query is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="109">technology that lets you do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">exactly that, and analyze </span><span class="line" data-startTime="113">your massive data sets. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="117">And the nice thing about it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">that you have this browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">tool &mdash; that I'll show in a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">minute &mdash; and a command line </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">tool that let you play, quite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="122">quickly, with the data, even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">before you start approaching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">the API and start building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">your project that will create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">some useful tool for your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="133">organization. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="135">Luckily for us, you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">go today &mdash; and I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="138">make it a bit bigger &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">and the sign up is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">just right here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="141">And it's open, now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="141">for everyone. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="144">So you don't need to have any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">invite, or any betavite. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="148">In our little case, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="148">chose the [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155"> &mdash; that's importing the HTTP </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">archives, where we have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">ability to ask some [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="158">on the web, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">how we could get insights </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">about what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="163">going on with web data. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="167">So when we're coming to this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">browser tool, you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">quite quickly that we have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">ability to go and to have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="173">those public samples. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="176">I'll make it a bit bigger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="177">It will be easier to read. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="179">And in our case, I'll just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">choose Wikipedia, but you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="182">lots of other things. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="183">And first thing, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">getting the schema. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="185">If we go to the details, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="185">immediately, you could have, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">first, just the grasp of what is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="189">the size of this data, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">when it was created, how many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="196">rows we are talking here &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">in our case, north of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="199">300 million rows &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">and how this table </span><span class="line" data-startTime="203">is composed &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">so all the different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="206">characteristics that you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="208">later run a query on. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="211">Here, I prepared and we have, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">here, a query history. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="215">A simple query, that if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="215">I'll click on it &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">let's make it a bit prettier, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="219">and make it larger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="224">So this query is getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">the top 10 sites &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">sorry, 10 articles &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">that where revised frequently. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="233">And we want to see just what are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">those articles that people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">have changed them again, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">and again, and again. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="239">When we are running, you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="239">here, we're getting how many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="242">seconds it's taking. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="244">And here in our case, to go and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">to count over north of 300 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">million rows took 2.4 seconds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="252">So, quite impressive. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="255">And here, if I just take this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="255">line and make it bigger, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">can see a few of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="267">popular terms. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="273">Quite funny that the list of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">World Wrestling is very, very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="279">high, considerably. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="282">What we want to show today, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="282">that's something pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">cool, is that the HTTP archive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">is basically a site that just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">gathers what is going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="291">on the web. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="293">As we know, it's important </span><span class="line" data-startTime="293">to see how things are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">progressing, how things are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">moving, what are the trends, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">if it's going forward </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">or backwards. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="302">We want to make sure that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">know, and we have a way to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">analyze it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="306">And this great initiative is an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">open source project that I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">was lucky enough to contribute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">to in the past. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="312">And all the data here is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="312">of course, downloadable. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="315">So you could take it with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="315">you, and analyze it on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">your own free time. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="319">The only problem is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="319">it's more than 400 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">gigabytes of data &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">so, like a magnitude of 10 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="324">times what we saw just a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="327">minute ago with Wikipedia. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="329">There are a few interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">trends, and slides, and stats </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">that you can see here, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="335">on the site, itself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="337">But of course, it's much more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">powerful to analyze and to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">have the ability to query </span><span class="line" data-startTime="339">it on our own. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="342">So if we go into the browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">tool, we have here &mdash; and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">you'll need to edit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="348">And I'll have a post that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="348">gives you all the little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">details of how you could edit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="351">to your project, later on &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">But you have, here, basically, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="355">all the runs and all the data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">that you would want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">to query later. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="361">And again, in our case, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">prepared a short query that &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">it's a bit longer, as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">you can see here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="370">But let's make it a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">bit more readable. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="375">Basically, I'm querying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="375">on June and July. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="379">But for our example, let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">keep it just for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="383">June, and run it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="385">And what I want to see in this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="385">query is which are the most </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">popular sites &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">basically, APIs &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">that are being used </span><span class="line" data-startTime="392">by other sites. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="394">So in this case, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="394">see quite quickly &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">let's make it a bit bigger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="402">And now let's &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407"> &mdash; quite well that Facebook </span><span class="line" data-startTime="407">is in the lead. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="410">And then, you have Google, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="410">Doubleclick, and Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">Syndication, and Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="413">Analytics leading the chart. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="417">Of course, you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="417">save this table. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="419">You could download it, and work </span><span class="line" data-startTime="419">with it off this browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">tool two, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="424">other tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="426">And it's a quite nice way just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="426">to see what we are doing, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">how we are going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="429">approach the data. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="431">Now the big, nice thing about it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="431">is that, with App Script &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">and this is the example </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">that I prepared &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">we could take the same thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="438">that we saw just now, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">automate it, and automate it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">quite quickly and easily. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="444">And how we are going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">to do it &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">I'll just show the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="445">code [INAUDIBLE] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">maybe we'll just jump </span><span class="line" data-startTime="450">in and see what the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="453">results look like. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="454">So I composed this data from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">the code that we have. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="459">And as you can see here, I have, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="459">here, a new menu item </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">that allows me to run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">those queries, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="464">get the data here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="466">And after I'm getting the data &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">for instance, in our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">case, I just wanted to see which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">are the top 10 sites </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">that are being used by others. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="473">But I wanted to run it on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">the previous 12 months. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="477">So I wanted to see some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="477">sort of a trend. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="480">Is the usage going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">a certain direction? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">Does it move up? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">Does it move down? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">And here, I just used the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="487">charting to take a few bold </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">examples like Twitter, Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">Analytics, and Facebook. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="494">And as you can see here, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">taken just a bit of time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="498">But you can see quite nicely </span><span class="line" data-startTime="498">that, maybe here at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">beginning of 2012, the HTTP </span><span class="line" data-startTime="503">archive wasn't crawling the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">same amount of sites that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="508">it's crawling today. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="510">So we see quite a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">nice ramp up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="513">But you could definitely say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="513">something about the end of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">last year &mdash; so around November, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">December, 2012. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="522">And then up to today, we see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">that, in February, we had a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">bit of a drop down. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="526">And then, you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="526">see the trend. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="529">Another interesting aspect is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">Google Analytics, of course. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="533">You can see it very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">steadily going up. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="535">And now, it's a bit flat. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="538">And Facebook &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">and here, it's mostly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="539">Facebook CDN &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">it's quite different, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">I just moved the bar here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="548">Why? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">I think, because of the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="548">the data was sorted. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="551">But you can see clearly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="551">that it's going up. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="553">Then we had some drop at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="553">beginning of this year. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="558">And now, the trend </span><span class="line" data-startTime="558">is quite flat. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="560">So it's quite nice and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">interesting to see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="563">trends that are going. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="564">Let's jump into the code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="564">and just go over it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="567">So the first function here is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="567">a quite basic initializing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">function that will trigger when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="571">we open the Google sheet </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">that we have right here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="577">And it will just add a menu item </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">that we saw right here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="581">So this is the menu item, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">as you can see here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="592">Now I hope that you can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="592">still &mdash; yeah, OK. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="596">You can still see it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="599">So we have this menu item. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="602">And let's jump into the code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="606">So this code just added </span><span class="line" data-startTime="606">this menu item. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="609">And it's letting us run, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="609">basically, all the different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">queries that we want to run. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="614">And here, I have another query </span><span class="line" data-startTime="614">that just allows me to run all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">the queries that I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">under my hand. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="620">So it's a very useful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="620">way to just &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">let's say you have a daily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">dashboard that you want to get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">insights, and to run your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">several queries, and then, get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="629">the results back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="630">It will be quite nice to have a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">function to just gather all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">the queries, and make sure that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">you are generating them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="637">with one entry point. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="638">And here in our case, it's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">query, or the function, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="642">will give us the results of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="642">which are the top 10 sites &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="645">or APIs, actually &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">that are being used by third </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">parties, over time. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="649">You can see, here, that I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="649">getting a default of where I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">want this data to be output on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">the sheet, itself &mdash; so what is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">the starting row, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">the starting column. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="658">Then, I have this unique </span><span class="line" data-startTime="658">identifier to my project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="661">And if you want to mimic it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="661">you'll need to go to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">console on Google APIs, and make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">sure that you're creating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">a new project, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="669">you're allowing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="671">yourself to run Big Query. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="673">I'll have, again, all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">details on how to do it in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">blog post that I'll publish just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="676">after this GDL session. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="681">Then, we get the handler </span><span class="line" data-startTime="681">on that active </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">sheet that we have. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="684">In our case, it's this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="684">guy &mdash; third parties. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="687">And here, we just dump </span><span class="line" data-startTime="687">all the raw data. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="692">Here, I have all the dates that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="692">I want to, basically, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">query against. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="696">Another fun part is here, where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="696">I'm just building the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">SQL and making sure that this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="699">SQL is composed from several </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">SQLs, that each and every one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="704">of them is just going on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">certain file, and fetching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="707">the information from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="711">the specific file. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="712">If you saw, before that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="712">we were gathering </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">the files per month. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="717">So pages and requests would be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="717">gathered on a monthly basis. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="722">And then, when we query them, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="722">it's a much more efficient way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="726">to go month by month, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="726">get the results back. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="732">So after we compose this nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">SQL variable, we'll create </span><span class="line" data-startTime="737">another query results object. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="739">And in this try/catch block, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="739">we'll just go to Big Query </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">object, jobs, and set the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="744">query with the project </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">identifier in our SQL. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="751">The beauty, here, is that this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="751">object, now, will run the job </span><span class="line" data-startTime="756">in the background. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="757">And once its completed, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">it will return us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">getJobComplete() == True. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="762">What we want to do, here, is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">just run on this loop, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">make sure that we are fetching </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">the results just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">when this guy is true. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="772">And if it's, of course, not, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="772">we'll just keep trying. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="781">Now we are just setting some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">boilerplate metadata on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">query, itself &mdash; how many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">rows we go back, etc. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="788">We could definitely dump them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="788">into another sheet, and get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">some insights of what was the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">metadata of the query, itself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="795">And last but not least, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">just building the object of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="798">dumping the result's values. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="801">We get all the content that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">want to put on our sheet. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="805">And then, we're just getting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="805">the right range, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">setting the values with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="808">results' values. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="812">Last but not least, we'll just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">jump here, and, with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">message box, inform the user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">that everything is done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="820">Let's see how it's run. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="823">It might take a bit of time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">but we'll run it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="826">I'm just choosing the function </span><span class="line" data-startTime="826">that I want to run here &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">in our case, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">this function &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="832">and then, I'm clicking run. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="834">As you can see, it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="834">now running it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="836">And if we come here, basically, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="836">we're getting a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">notification that something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">is working. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="842">And now you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="842">that all is done. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="844">We have all the answers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="845">And you see here, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">fresh data that was just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">produced from this specific </span><span class="line" data-startTime="852">function. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="855">The code will be, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="855">of course, live. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="857">Actually, part of this code is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="857">already live on my GitHub </span><span class="line" data-startTime="864">repository, and it's public. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="865">So of course, I'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="865">have a link here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="868">But you could check out greenido </span><span class="line" data-startTime="868">on GitHub, and get </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">different queries here, and of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="872">course, all the boilerplate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="875">code that I just showed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="875">a second ago. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="882"> &mdash; case use for these types of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">things is the ability to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">create your own dashboard, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">quite quickly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="888">And if you think about it, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="888">you have this big data </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">inside Big Query, you could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="891">quite quickly go with App </span><span class="line" data-startTime="896">Script, and create your daily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="896">dashboard, get a trigger. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="900">And here is a nice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="900">ability to just &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">sorry, just here, you could put </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">what your triggers are. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="908">Make sure that, for instance, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="908">we want to add a new trigger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="912">that will run this specific </span><span class="line" data-startTime="912">query on a specific event. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="921">And this powerful thing will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">give us the ability to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">basically create new dashboards </span><span class="line" data-startTime="924">that, once we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">fetching the data from the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="930">query, we can emulate, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="933">could update the sheet, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="933">and of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="935">share it with our coworkers. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="938">So that's what I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="938">had this time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="941">And if someone would like to ask </span><span class="line" data-startTime="941">questions on the chat, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="946">live, here, please feel free. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="954">So I see one thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">from a developer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="957">They're asking if they could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="957">run Big Query with other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="964">languages and technologies. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="965">And the answer, of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="965">course, is yes. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="968">We actually have lots of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="968">libraries and clients that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="972">supporting almost, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="972">think, any popular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="974">language that is out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="977">A great way to start and check </span><span class="line" data-startTime="977">how you could write with it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="980">and how you could work with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="980">Java, Python, and others would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="984">be to go to this page, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="984">just check on Big Query's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="992">APIs, Big Query client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="992">libraries. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="998">And from here, you could see, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">quite quickly, that we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1002">lots of client libraries for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1002">almost any popular technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1008">that is out there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1010">So if there are other questions, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1010">this is the time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1016">If not, thank you for joining </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1016">us, and we'll be here next </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1019">week with interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1019">startups. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1021">So be strong, and bye bye. </span></p>
