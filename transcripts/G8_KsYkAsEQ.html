<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="14"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Hi, I'm Don Dodge, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="14">and this is "Google Root </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">Access." Today we're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="17">talk about open source &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">how Google uses open source, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">how Google contributes to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="24">open source. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">My guest today is Chris DiBona, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="25">who runs the Open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="28">Source Projects for Google. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="30">Welcome, Chris. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="30"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Thanks, Don. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="31"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So tell me, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="31">do you do at Google? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="34"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: So very basically, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="34">if there's open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">source at Google it's my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="38">job and my team's job </span><span class="line" data-startTime="41">to look after it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="43">And that includes all the code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="43">we might use when creating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">sites like google.com, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="47">Gmail, and all the docs and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">spreadsheets and apps </span><span class="line" data-startTime="50">that we have online. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="53">But also all the things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="53">that we ship &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">things like Android </span><span class="line" data-startTime="54">and Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="56">And if you have a Nexus device, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="56">or if you're one of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">the people who is a Google Glass </span><span class="line" data-startTime="59">beta tester, you'll be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">running open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="64">code on there. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="66">Whether as part of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="66">proprietary software running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">on top of it, or as a whole </span><span class="line" data-startTime="69">open source ecosystem like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="74">Android and Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="76">So we make sure that we ship </span><span class="line" data-startTime="76">things within compliance of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">those licenses, but also so that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="79">those teams have correct </span><span class="line" data-startTime="84">infrastructure as well. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="85">So we look after all kinds of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="85">infrastructure for Android and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">some of the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="88">teams right now. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="90"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So some people may </span><span class="line" data-startTime="90">not know this, but Google's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">roots are actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="94">in open source. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">Google built its own servers </span><span class="line" data-startTime="96">and used Linux, and hacked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">Linux to do very interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="101">things. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">Can you tell us a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="104">about that? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="105"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Sure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="105">Well, actually, if you look back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">to when Larry and Sergey </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">were at Stanford and building </span><span class="line" data-startTime="108">BackRub, which of course </span><span class="line" data-startTime="111">became Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="112">That was all written in Python </span><span class="line" data-startTime="112">and using some fairly standard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">web serving tools and libraries, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="117">and they put the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">uniqueness that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">Google on that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="123">So you had Python running on top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="123">of Linux, running on top </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">of all kinds and all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="126">manner of hardware. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="129">And as we grew up as a company, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="129">we kept that ethos </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">where we would get what a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="132">of people would consider </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">fairly trashy hardware, and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="135">would get our reliability from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="143">the software layer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="144">And that was Linux, and that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="144">was Python, and that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">eventually Java and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="147">C and the rest. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="149">And so we started with open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="149">source in a lot of ways and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">built on top of it, and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="155">been a pretty healthy code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="159">system since then. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="160"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So Google not only </span><span class="line" data-startTime="160">uses open source and used it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">to build the base of Google, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="165">infrastructure of Google, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">but Google also contributes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="169">to open source? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="171"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Yeah, to date </span><span class="line" data-startTime="171">we've conservatively estimated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">that we've contributed from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="174">Google Developers about 50 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">million lines of code, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="178">give or take. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">And that spans everything from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="179">Android and Chromium, all the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="184">way through to compilers. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">For instance, if you have any </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">consumer electronics device </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">that's been made in the last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="191">five years, you're probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">running some Google code on it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="194">and you don't even know it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">through the libraries that we've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">contributed to and just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">the vast number of projects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="201">we've released, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">so it's fairly shocking. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">And this is not even taking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">into account the vast </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">proliferation of Android, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="207">the technology inside Android. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="211"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So the infrastructure </span><span class="line" data-startTime="211">things &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="213">BigTable and Hadoop. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">Tell us a little bit about how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">that evolved and what are some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">of those open source projects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="220">that either came out of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">BigTable in Google's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">infrastructure, or were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="226">modeled after that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="228"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Yeah, so if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="228">look at Hadoop, we published a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">paper back in 2000, I want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="230">say 2002 or 2003, about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">Google File System which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="233">is called GFS. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="237">And it inspired folks like Doug </span><span class="line" data-startTime="237">Cutting to go out and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">write open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="241">implementations of this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="243">technology. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="244">And that happens with a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="244">of the things that we do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">publications about, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="246">don't actually ship </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">as open source software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="249">So what you see coming from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="249">Google is often, if we talk </span><span class="line" data-startTime="256">about it, people will want it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="258">And if we don't release it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="258">as open source, they'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">try to create it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="261">That's actually really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="261">healthy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="262">And so you've seen a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="262">proliferation of these kinds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">of big data tools like MongoDB </span><span class="line" data-startTime="265">and Redis and LevelDB and all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">these really interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="271">large-scale key </span><span class="line" data-startTime="273">value stores and stuff. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="274">And they have their roots in us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="274">publishing papers about our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">internal systems like BigTable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="280">and NGFS and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="283">Spanner and the rest. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="285"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: You mentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="285">Chromium, Android, and some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">other pretty major open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="289">products that Google has. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">Are they licensed the same and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="296">they are basically the same? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">Or are they quite different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">in how we handle them? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="302"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: So Chromium </span><span class="line" data-startTime="302">and Android are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="304">actually quite different. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="306">If you look at Chromium, when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="306">we wrote it we really wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">to inspire other browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="309">manufacturers to, frankly, do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">what we do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="314">And so we wanted to make it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="314">possible for them to actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="317">use our code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="318">So beyond just contributing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="318">to WebKit, we also made a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">conscious decision to license </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">Chromium under BSD. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="326">Because that code would then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="326">be consumable by not just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">WebKit-based browsers, but also </span><span class="line" data-startTime="329">those of them that might </span><span class="line" data-startTime="332">use Gecko, Mozilla. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="334">Even Microsoft could take that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="334">code and pull it into their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">browser or their software, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="337">not just learn, but actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">just use what we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="341">publishing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="343">Because when we shipped </span><span class="line" data-startTime="343">Chromium &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">this is something a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="344">people don't understand &mdash; when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">we first shipped to Chrome and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="347">Chromium, this was a time when </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">one tab getting slow would take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="352">down your whole browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="354">And we weren't really taking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">advantage of the full </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">capabilities of a modern </span><span class="line" data-startTime="357">CPU or modern hardware. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="361">And so we really wanted to bring </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">that kind of processed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">isolation, and also the security </span><span class="line" data-startTime="365">in a sandbox to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">browser so that people could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="368">feel the browser was a safe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">place to work and to consume </span><span class="line" data-startTime="370">information. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="374">So we tried to convince other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="374">browser manufacturers that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="377">this was really important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="379">And we decided that it was time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="379">to just do it, and do it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">in such a way that they could, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="384">if they ended up agreeing with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="387">us later, just adopt the work. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="389">And we've been moderately </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">successful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="391">with that later mission. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="393">But I think Chromium has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">very successful at showing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">that you can take real advantage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="395">of processed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">isolation and sandboxing to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="398">secure a web browser. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="401">And I think that's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="401">important, and people miss </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">that all the time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="404">Now, Android's a different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="404">story together. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="406">With Android, we licensed </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">Android under the Apache </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">license with the kernel being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="408">the GPL Linux kernel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="412">And we chose Apache for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="412">a number of reasons. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="415">Apache has this really awesome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">language around patents. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="418">So it says, hey, if you're using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="418">our software and we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">patents that read on that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="422">software, we're not going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">come and rent seek against </span><span class="line" data-startTime="425">you for that software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">unless you sue us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="430">So if you sue us, we're going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="430">to retain the rights to use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">those patents in the defense </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">of our company against you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="436">But otherwise, we're telling you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="436">that you have nothing to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">fear from Google and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="439">from using Android. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="444">And that was a really big deal, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">and I think it really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="446">mattered with the carriers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="447">Also, Apache has this unusual </span><span class="line" data-startTime="447">aspect to it in the world of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">open source where it says we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="451">just want you to acknowledge </span><span class="line" data-startTime="454">you're using it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="455">We don't need you to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="455">your source code, too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="457">And for the carriers who have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">a lot of balls that they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">juggle in the air at one time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="463">making compliance easier for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="466">them is very important. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="469">And I think it has a lot to do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="469">with why Android is as popular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">as it is with so many </span><span class="line" data-startTime="472">manufacturers, and you know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">that it's a real open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="476">source project. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="478">So companies will often </span><span class="line" data-startTime="478">say hey, I've got </span><span class="line" data-startTime="480">this open source thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="481">And then you'll see that they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="481">the only ones running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">it, and the only ones who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="483">will ever run it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="486">And it comes down to trust, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="486">and it comes down to what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="488">license they use. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="490">I think it's extremely telling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="490">that when you look at a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">Kindle, or you look at a Nook, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="492">or you look at half a dozen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">Android-based devices </span><span class="line" data-startTime="496">that don't have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="498">anything to do with Google. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="500">That they continue to persistent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="500">and exist, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="502">that's really open source. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="504">We can't stop them, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="504">nor do we want to. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="506">But even if we wanted to, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="506">couldn't stop them from using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="510">the software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="511">And that's how you know it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="511">really open source. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="512"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So I sort of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">understand how open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="515">works and what it is. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">But I'm confused about this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="517">jumble of licenses, there's an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="521">alphabet soup of licenses. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="522"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: You're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="522">not alone. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="523"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Can you say a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">bit about what are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">major licenses and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="525">differences? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="528"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Well, there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">three major </span><span class="line" data-startTime="529">categories of licenses. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">There's what we call the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="530">permissive licenses, and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">basically say, here's some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="534">code, Don, enjoy it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">And all we really ask from you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="537">is that you mark in your about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">box or in your documentation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="540">that you're using it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="542">So those are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="543">permissive/notification licenses. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="545"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: What are some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="545">examples of the [INAUDIBLE]? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="546"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: So that would be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="546">BSD, that would be Apache, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">MIT, ones like that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="552">And then there are the more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="552">share alike style licenses. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="554">And they say if I give my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="554">software to Don and Don ships </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">something, well, then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="559">he's obligated to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="560">share his code, too. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="562">For some definition of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="562">share and use and all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="565">the rest, of course. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="566">But those are your GPL licenses, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="566">your LGPL licenses, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">and to a lesser degree the MPL </span><span class="line" data-startTime="570">licenses as part of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="576">Mozilla tri-license. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="577">So depending on which one it is, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="577">you'd either have to share </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">more or less code, depending on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="581">how you use that software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="584">And this stuff is deeply </span><span class="line" data-startTime="584">confusing, so you shouldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">feel like you're ignorant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="589">of this stuff &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">almost everyone is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="593">And it's not just a jobs program </span><span class="line" data-startTime="593">for me and people like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">me, it's just complicated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="596">stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="598">Because these licenses, they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="598">say how people feel about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="602">sharing their software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="604">And when you talk about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">feelings, things get confusing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="607">and complicated. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="609">And then the third category of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="609">licenses are the ones that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="613">trying to also define network </span><span class="line" data-startTime="613">performance as being the kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">of sharing that invokes the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">resharing of software. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="623">So there are very few of these, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="623">and they're applied to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">very few actual pieces </span><span class="line" data-startTime="625">of software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="627">But it's a version of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">the GPL called the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="630">Affero GPL, or the AGPL. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="633">And so, for instance, we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="633">use any AGPL software at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">Google and we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="636">allow it here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="638">And that would be like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">MongoDB, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="639">RStudio and the rest. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="641">And so in those cases, we either </span><span class="line" data-startTime="641">purchase a commercial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">license from those software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="644">companies or we simply don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">allow them. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="648"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So the AGPL, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="648">don't use that because &mdash; ? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="651"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Because as it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="651">interacts with other software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">and then is displayed on, say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="656">a google.com site or on a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">Gmail or apps site, we would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="660">then have to share more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">software than we're comfortable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">sharing through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="666">the linking to that software. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="668"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So if I'm a startup </span><span class="line" data-startTime="668">and I'm building my company, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">what do I need to look out for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="673">in terms of using open source? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="677">And which license should I have, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="677">and that kind of thing? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="680"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Well, except for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="680">the AGPL, you pretty much </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">don't have anything to worry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="683">about as, say, a web startup. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="685">If you're going to be shipping </span><span class="line" data-startTime="685">software, that's a somewhat </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">longer conversation where you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="688">try to suss out what the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="691">startup wants to do, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="691">they're shipping, what they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="694">want to share. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="695">Because open source is, in my </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">mind, also a fundamental part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">of a developer relations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="698">strategy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">and a developer ecosystem. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="702">Without it you don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="702">have one, or it's a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="706">very unfair one, frankly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="708">So what I tell startups when I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="708">advise them is that when you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">bring software into the company </span><span class="line" data-startTime="713">that isn't written by </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">someone at the company, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="715">that means anything &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="718">examples, software from places </span><span class="line" data-startTime="718">like GitHub, or Stack </span><span class="line" data-startTime="721">Exchange, or Stack Overflow &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="726">you should always put these in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="726">a special directory, like a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="728">third party directory. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="729">This is what we do at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="729">Google, by the way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="731">We have millions of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="731">these directories </span><span class="line" data-startTime="732">all over the place. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="733">Segregate the code &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">you can absolutely, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="734">unconditionally still use it, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">you just want to keep it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">out in a special place. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="741"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: In your code base </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">you actually segregate the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">open source code and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="743">you keep it there? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="745"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="746">And so you have these third </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">party directories and then you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">call that code in whatever way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="748">you see fit, but then at least </span><span class="line" data-startTime="753">you know where it is. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="754">So there are other hygiene </span><span class="line" data-startTime="754">things you can do, like make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">sure you only have one version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="757">of a specific library, even if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">it's used across multiple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="760">products. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="762">Keeping up to date with security </span><span class="line" data-startTime="762">[INAUDIBLE], all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">these things that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="764">fundamental to development. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="766">But keeping things separate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="766">enough that you can keep on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">identifying it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">pretty amazing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="773">If you have that, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="773">better than 90% of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">companies out there. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="777"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="777">rule number one? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="778"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: That's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="778">rule number one. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="781">You have to be careful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="781">with the AGPL. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="783">So for instance, a lot of people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="783">really like MongoDB </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">right now for what it does, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="785">that makes perfect sense. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="789">And if you look at how MongoDB </span><span class="line" data-startTime="789">is licensed and the way they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">articulate that license, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="791">it's very clever. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="795">They have very smart client </span><span class="line" data-startTime="795">licensing, which basically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">doesn't transfer that network </span><span class="line" data-startTime="801">obligation onto a website. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="806">But the database itself is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">something you have to, if you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">make improvements to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="811">database, if you have certain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">code interacting with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="813">database in certain ways, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="815">code may end up being shared. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="816">So you'll just want to know that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="816">when you're using tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="819">like MongoDB. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="821">Magento is another really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">popular shopping cart </span><span class="line" data-startTime="823">application. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="825">And it's not unfair to say </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">that this drives a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">license revenue to Magento and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="830">MongoDB, and it's fair and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="833">this is their deal. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="834">They're saying listen, we want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="834">you to use this stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="835">But if you use it in certain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">ways, you should be paying us. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="838">And so that's a commercial </span><span class="line" data-startTime="838">software license that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="840">would get from them. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="843">So that's the sort of thing we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="843">see in acquisitions actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="845">quite a bit. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="846"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Good point. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">You also review acquisitions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="847">for Google. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">Every time Google does an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="851">acquisition, you look at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">code and look for open source, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="853">make sure it's licensed. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">So say a little bit about what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="856">you do in that process. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="858"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Yeah, so for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="858">instance, suppose you're a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="861">startup that does something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="861">with video. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="863">You're probably using FFmpeg, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">you're probably using it with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="866">certain compile flags. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="867">And most people don't even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="867">know this, by the way. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="869">At this point, by the time I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="869">say compile flags, it means </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">there's a developer inside that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="871">organization who built </span><span class="line" data-startTime="874">that piece of software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="875">And I can actually tell from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="875">the output that I, the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">consumer, can see pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="879">much what you've done. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="882">So it's very easy for me to say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="882">OK, you're probably using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="884">this, this, and this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="885">And they're like, who told </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">you what we're using? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="886">And it's like, we know. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="889">We've seen a million startups </span><span class="line" data-startTime="889">like this, and so here's what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="892">you'll have to do to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="892">compliant with these licenses. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="895">So we have that discussion a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="895">lot with companies, by deal </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">close you have to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">do X, Y, and Z. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="899">And it's funny, when I was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="899">younger and maybe more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">idealistic or less cynical, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="904">would say, I can't believe </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">these people are breaking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="907">licenses in such </span><span class="line" data-startTime="909">a fundamental way. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="910">But what it is is most people's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">intentions are pure. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="913">They just don't know how to be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="913">compliant with these licenses, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">and sometimes it's actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">deeply complicated. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="918">So oftentimes when we see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="918">acquisitions come in, we'll </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">say, OK, if you want to keep </span><span class="line" data-startTime="921">shipping this piece of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">software, you have to do X and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="923">Y and Z. And you've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">shipping this piece of software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="925">for this long, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="928">you'll need to do this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="929">So that people who want their </span><span class="line" data-startTime="929">rights under the open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="933">licenses which you have chosen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="933">to use are going to be able to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="936">be satisfied. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="938">Because we like to in some </span><span class="line" data-startTime="938">ways over-comply. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="939">Put up mirrors of code so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="939">that people can find the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">information they want about open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="944">source in your product </span><span class="line" data-startTime="948">simply by googling for it. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="949">It saves us a lot of time than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="949">having to answer emails and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">sit on mailing lists and worry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="954">a lot about things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="958">So we try to bring people into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="958">our level of compliance, which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">is very high, by the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="961">time a deal closes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="964">We've never had to scuttle a an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="969">acquisition because of this. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="971">I've seen acquisitions fall </span><span class="line" data-startTime="971">apart, and this might be a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="974">component of that, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="974">it's very rare. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="976">It's more that bringing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="976">discipline to your code base </span><span class="line" data-startTime="980">for open source really has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="980">higher implications about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">quality of the code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="982">of the company. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="984"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Overall? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="984"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Yeah, exactly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="985">So it's extremely rare </span><span class="line" data-startTime="985">to find somebody who </span><span class="line" data-startTime="988">understands this stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="990">What's the right way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="990">to say this? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">If someone has a good, tidy </span><span class="line" data-startTime="994">code base, then they're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">usually also either very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="998">compliant with open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">licenses already, or easily </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1001">able to become compliant. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1004">If they're not compliant with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1004">open source licenses and they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1008">have an untidy code base, that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1008">could have implications, too, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">during an acquisition that have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1011">nothing to do with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1014">open source license compliance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1014">and everything to do with how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">they develop and how they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1017">bring software together. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1020">It's more of an indicator. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1021"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So if a startup is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1021">using MongoDB, or Magento &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1023"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Which a lot are. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1024">It's a great tool. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1025">They're both great tools. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1026"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1026">happens then? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1030">We just don't consider using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1030">that kind of software? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1034"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: In rare cases we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1034">have a pool of licenses for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">them to draw upon, but we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1039">keep that very limited. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1042">Because usually when people come </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1042">to Google, they end up </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">transferring onto our technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1044">or we're shutting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1046">their technology off. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1051">It depends on the situation. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1054">It's very hard to say we always </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1054">do X or we always do Y. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1056">Because we want to remain </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1056">flexible for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1059">these kinds of things. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1060">There are some companies, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1060">I'm not going to name them, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">where if you have GPL software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1063">they will simply force you to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">rip it out before they'll even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1066">talk to you, much less let the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">deal close. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1071">So it's rare nowadays, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1071">it certainly happens. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">And I'm not talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1076">the Linux kernel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1078">Everyone's comfortable with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1078">the Linux kernel. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1080">It's sort of an accepted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1080">thing that they have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1083">to deal with that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1085">But for some GPL tools and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1085">system libraries and web </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">frameworks and stuff, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1091">they don't want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1093">to have that around. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1094"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Well, that's really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1094">a competitive advantage for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">Google and it has been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1096">from the beginning. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1098"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: I would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1098">consider it so. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1099">Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1100">For instance, if you reject all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1100">GPL and LGPL code, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">rejecting 75% of the open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1103">code that's out there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">And we're talking, I think it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1106">was probably 35 million unique </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">files out there encompassing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1110">maybe 5 billion lines of code. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">So you would be rejecting 75% </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1115">of that just by saying, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">don't want to deal with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1117">the GPL and the LGPL. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">Again, it's a fine </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1120">decision to make. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">I think it's very limiting. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1124"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So Google roots are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1124">in open source and we use open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">source, we contribute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1127">to open source. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1129"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: We create new open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1129">source developers with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1132">the Summer of Code. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1133">I mean, we do a lot. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1134"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Say more about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1134">the Summer of Code. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1136">You've been writing that program </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1136">for quite a while. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1137"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Yeah, we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1137">coming up on our </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1138">ninth year, I believe. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1140">And what that does is it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1140">basically introduces students </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1142">to open source software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1144">It sets up a one-to-one </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1144">mentoring relationship between </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1146">open source software projects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1146">and students. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1150">So the idea was Larry Page was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1150">uncomfortable that people were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">leaving college for the summer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1156">and then backsliding over the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1159">summer because they had to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1159">go get a job that wasn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1162">computer-related. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1164">So he was like, if you could fix </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1164">that, that would be great. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1166">And I was like, OK. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1167">So we came up with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1167">Summer of Code as a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1169">way of fixing that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1169">And the idea was we would give </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1169">people real world, real bug, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1173">real problem experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1173">in open source. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">And it would also expose them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1176">to the world of open source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1178">development. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1179">I think that's been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1179">an incredible good </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1182">for computer science. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1183">We've only taken about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1183">10,000 students </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1185">through the program now. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1186"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: 10,000? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1186">That's a lot. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1187"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Yeah. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">10,000, 9,000, yeah, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1189">about that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1192">And we pay them over the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1192">summer to do this work. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1194"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: So they actually </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1194">get paid to do this? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1195"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: Yeah. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1196">We spend a fair amount </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1196">of money. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1198">And they on average write about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1198">3,000 lines of code that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1204">ends up into open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1204">source software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1205">So you can do the math </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1205">there, too &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">it's a significant </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1206">amount of code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1212">When you're a computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1212">science student &mdash; </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">I don't know if you went through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1213">CS school &mdash; but you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">taught a lot of theory and a lot </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1216">of comparative programing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1218">languages and algorithms </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1218">and that kind of thing. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1220">You're not taught what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1220">happens when a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1222">user uses your software. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1224">You're not taught what happens </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1224">when they decide to run it on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">some horrible piece </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1226">of trash computer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1228">that you never expected. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1230">And open source software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1230">projects are exposed to that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1233">kind of real world usage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1233">all the time. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">And so you get a whole different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1235">view into how to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">make a software program work and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1237">what users need by working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1241">on open source. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1242">And additionally, this is not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1242">a we bring them into Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1245">and host them kind of program. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1247">This is a wherever they are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1247">all over the world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1249">We've done this in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1249">93 countries now. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1250"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Really? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1251"><span class="speakerName">Chris DiBona</span>: And paying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1251">people in 93 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1252">countries is not easy. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1255">But we've had students in pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1255">much any country you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">can think of in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1258">modern world. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1261">Well, perhaps there's more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1261">now that there's 273 </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1263">countries in the UN. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1266">It's been pretty remarkable to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1266">see how these students turn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">from these neophyte programmers, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1272">really, into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1276">pretty amazing remote </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1276">programmers, which frankly is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1279">something that industry </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1279">struggles with. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1281">Having remote developers is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1281">extremely difficult, and open </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1285">source seems to figure it out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1286">And what it comes down to, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1286">really, is the people who are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1290">good at that kind of thing are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1290">good at open source, and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1292">people who aren't, aren't. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1294">So we had the failure mechanism </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1294">in the Summer of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1298">Code as well where we probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1298">fail about 14%, 15% of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1301">students every year out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1301">of the program. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1303">And that means they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1303">don't get paid at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1305">some step of the program. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1307">So maybe they'll get the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1307">acceptance fee, but not the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1309">mid-term or the final payment. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1312">So it's very merit-based which </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1312">is also, I think, a key thing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1315">about open source. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1316">You either do a good job or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1316">you're not part of it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1320"><span class="speakerName">Don Dodge</span>: Fascinating. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">Well, thank you. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">Thank you for being here today </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1321">and for your contributions to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1325">open source at Google. </span></p>
