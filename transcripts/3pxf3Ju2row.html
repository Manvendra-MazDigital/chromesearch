<h1>Google I/O 2012 &mdash; Chrome Developer Tools Evolution</h1>

<h2>Sam Dutton, Pavel Feldman</h2>

<a class="video" href="http://youtu.be/3pxf3Ju2row">youtu.be/3pxf3Ju2row</a><div id="transcript"><p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Hi, everyone. I think we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1">ready to begin if you would like to take a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">seat. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="8">Glad to see everyone here. Yeah, we're here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">to talk about the Chrome Development Tools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="10">today. If you are here for something else, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">I think you should stay because it will be </span><span class="line" data-startTime="13">a really good session. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">My name is Sam Dutton, I'm a developer advocate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="16">for Google Chrome. I'm based in London. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="20"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: And I'm Pavel Feldman, software </span><span class="line" data-startTime="20">engineer working at Google Chrome. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="23"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: And yeah, we're going to show </span><span class="line" data-startTime="23">you some great new features in Tools and hopefully </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">some stuff that can make your life easier </span><span class="line" data-startTime="27">as a developer. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="32">You know, 2012 has just been an incredible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="32">year on the Web. I was looking back at the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">session that Pavel did with &mdash; Paul Irish </span><span class="line" data-startTime="40">is in the house somewhere &mdash; last year, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">it amazes me how much the Chrome Tools have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="46">evolved in that time, how much the Web has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="52">changed in that time. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="52">It just seems like the normal thing now for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">you guys to be building these apps that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="57">incredibly complex and really pushing the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="62">limits of development on the clients' side. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="62">And I think that one thing I've found is that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">in a context, you know, a really great text </span><span class="line" data-startTime="68">editor just isn't always enough. And with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">that in mind I think that's where the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="75">Dev Tools come in. So what are we going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">talk about today? Well, we're going to run </span><span class="line" data-startTime="82">through some tools that we hope will boost </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">your productivity. And we'll also be looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="86">in some detail at using the tools to do mobile </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">Web developments. We'll also be looking at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="93">this idea of responsiveness. You know, what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">is it? How do we measure it and how do we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="100">deal with it in a scientific way rather than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">with guesswork? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="105">And you know, in a balance to that, also looking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">at memory and making sure that we stay on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="110">top of that. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="115">And all through this we'll be looking at a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="115">whole bunch of new features in the Tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="120">But first, we just wanted to say, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="120">I really big tip of the hat to all the people </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">who have contributed to the Tools in the last </span><span class="line" data-startTime="128">year with bug reports, feature requests and, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="134">you know, by committing code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="134">We've got a list here of some stuff, just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">touching the surface of stuff that's been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="139">put into the Tools in the last year just from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">user requests and user codes, you know, fantastic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="145">contributions, really good stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="150">Just to pick on one of these things, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="150">business of caching. Caching is a good thing, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="156">but it can be a real pain for developers. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="156">Particularly when you're dealing with situations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">where assets are being loaded dynamically </span><span class="line" data-startTime="161">after the onload event and in those situations </span><span class="line" data-startTime="167">a hard reload or whatever just isn't enough. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="167">So we have two new features in the tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="172">From the network panel you can right-click </span><span class="line" data-startTime="172">and clear the browser cache or you can even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="176">just turn off caching from the settings page. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="176">So yeah, great stuff from our users, and we're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="183">really grateful for that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="183">So with that in mind, we've got this roomful </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">of great developers, we thought we would take </span><span class="line" data-startTime="188">this opportunity to try and get from you guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">some ideas about what you would like right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="193">here, right now, to see next in the Tools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="198">You know, what challenges are you facing now? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="198">What would you like to see? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="202">Pavel? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="202"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Right, guys, that's your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">only opportunity, unique opportunity, to request </span><span class="line" data-startTime="204">something, and even without filing a bug I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">will be implementing it for you. So please </span><span class="line" data-startTime="209">shout out what you want from the devtools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">and we'll type it in and we'll make sure it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="214">not lost. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="217"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Right here, right now, shout </span><span class="line" data-startTime="217">it out. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="224">Audience member: [Inaudible - No Mic]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="224"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Okay, next, please. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">Audience member: [Inaudible - No Mic]. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="238">Audience member: [Inaudible - No Mic]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="248"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Thanks very much. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="248">One here. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="254">Audience member: [Inaudible - No Mic] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="254"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: And while on this side? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="259">Audience member: [Inaudible - No Mic]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="259"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: That we already have. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="263"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Let me put it in. I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="263">be happy to file the bug and close it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="268"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Okay. Down the front. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="268"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Storing edited CSS. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="276">Audience member: [Inaudible - No Mic]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="276"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Okay. And who else down in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">front? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="290">Audience member: [Inaudible - No Mic]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="294"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Here. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="294">Audience member: [Inaudible - No Mic]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="300"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Yes? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="300">Audience member: [Inaudible - No Mic]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="305"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Maybe two more. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="305">Audience member: [Inaudible - No Mic]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="313"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Like by the system in other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="313">words, like for San Serif or whatever. Behind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="320">you there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="320"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Bigger text in the developer tools. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="322"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Ah, we can help you with that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="322">Bigger text. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="325"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Bigger text. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="325"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: And right out the back. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="328"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Support for CSS preprocessors. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="328"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Yes. Good, good. That's fantastic. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="333"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Okay. That's a good list. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="333">I'm happy to say that at least half of it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">is already implemented. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="342">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="343"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: That's great. We'll take that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="343"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: So I'm making sure it is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">not lost. I'll be filing those by myself and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="350">probably will be implementing some of those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="354">personally. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="354"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: And I'll be following him around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">with a whip. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="358">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="361"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: So you know, like one of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="361">things &mdash; another thing we've noticed over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">the last 12 months or so is that people are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="366">using the tools now more for actually writing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">code, for building interfaces, not just for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="372">debugging. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">And with that in mind, when the devtools team </span><span class="line" data-startTime="376">have built in some great features for working </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">in the tools in that way, and I was thinking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="382">about just how to demonstrate it, how it increases </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">productivity, and I was thinking about the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="389">devtools team themselves, like the devtools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">team build the devtools to build the devtools. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="393">And good developers are really productive, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">so who better to ask about productivity than </span><span class="line" data-startTime="399">Pavel Feldman. It would be a good opportunity </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">to give Pavel Feldman a chance to give us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="406">a master class, show us how he works. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="411"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Now I feel flattered. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="411">Okay. Before we jump into the demos, let me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">say a few words about the productivity. What </span><span class="line" data-startTime="415">do we expect from the Tools for productivity? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">And for me it is getting into the source into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="421">where I need to fast. And being a part of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">the screen or an action or a process, I like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="427">to jump instantly into the source code that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="432">is responsible for this action. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="432">And vice versa, while looking at the source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">I want to know what it is responsible for, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="435">how do I get the part of the screen that it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">paints? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="441">While in the source code I am interested in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">changing it and more importantly I'm interesting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="444">in seeing an immediate feedback. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="449">And for those of you who have seen the Bret </span><span class="line" data-startTime="449">Victor's "Inventing on Principle" talk, if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">you haven't, please make sure you check it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="457">out. That's an image from Bret's slides. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="462">So the main principle Bret is talking about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="462">is the instant feedback. And as he goes through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">his demos it is clear that the instant feedback </span><span class="line" data-startTime="468">not only increases your productivity, makes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">you do things faster, but it also boosts your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="473">creativity, because when things are reflected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">fast, when you have an instant feedback, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="479">start experimenting. You go through the states </span><span class="line" data-startTime="485">that you have otherwise not visit. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="485">Now that you have changed the source code </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">and you've seen the feedback, the essential </span><span class="line" data-startTime="489">part of the tool is to persist it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="494">So let me show you how these map into the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="494">devtools features. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="501">I just started Chrome Canary, and it is a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="501">version of Chrome that is being updated on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">your machine daily. It is built from the tip </span><span class="line" data-startTime="512">of the tree sources from WebKit and Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">and contains all the features that are implemented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="518">by this date, including the devtools ones. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="523">So if you are a Web developer and you would </span><span class="line" data-startTime="523">like to make sure that everything works perfectly </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">on the next version of Chrome or if you'd </span><span class="line" data-startTime="528">like to use the tip of the tree devtools, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">please use the Canary and please provide us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="533">with your feedback. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="538">But more importantly, Canary can run side </span><span class="line" data-startTime="538">by side with your Chrome browser, so you no </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">longer need to choose whether you want to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="544">be on the Dev channel or Beta channel or Stable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">to test for the changes, just have those two </span><span class="line" data-startTime="549">installed and that will be very convenient. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="557">Oh, I have no connectivity. Sorry. It just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="557">plugged out. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="568">So I'm navigating to the WebKit.org. And WebKit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="568">is the project where most of the Chrome devtools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">source code belongs. We develop devtools fronted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="573">upstream. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="578">Let me load it once again. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="578">Okay. Let's go to the backup plan. We have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">a backup plan, don't we? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="591">Yeah, we do. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="598">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="598"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: So that's the WebKit. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">I'm going to do a lot of demos on the devtools, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="604">and we're going to hack devtools today, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">after this session you will be able to contribute </span><span class="line" data-startTime="608">your source code into the devtools yourself. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="612">Now, I'm going to debug this page, but before </span><span class="line" data-startTime="612">I &mdash; I'm not going to open the devtools using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">the command option I, I'll do it different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="619">then. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="627">I'm using remote debugging to start inspecting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="627">my page. And as you can see, remote debugging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">works as a regular devtools. You can see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="638">devtools is opened as a Web page. I can do </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">that because developer tools uses clients </span><span class="line" data-startTime="647">server architecture where browser acts as </span><span class="line" data-startTime="652">a server and a front end acts as a client. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="652">So the devtools that you have in your browser </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">is in fact a Web app read in HTML, JavaScript, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="657">CSS, and it's talking to the backup using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">Web Sockets. Did you know that? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="663">Okay, good. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="670">Now, it's &mdash; is it okay? Now it's time to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="670">debug. And as you can see, I open the devtools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="682">doc to the right and let me [Indiscernible]. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="682">Here we go. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="689">So what we are going to do here today is we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="689">are going to hack on the devtools itself because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">I'm a devtools engineer. I want to show you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="695">what I'm doing everyday. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="700">So that's regular old stuff. This is your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="700">Web page to the left. In my case it's devtools. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="707">And that's your devtools to the right. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="707">[ Laughter ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="709"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Pavel's life is so meta. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="709"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: So we get a bit of inception </span><span class="line" data-startTime="714">here, so don't get confused. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="714">Okay. Now, I've been working lately on the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="722">timeline features. And as I was editing the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="722">timeline features, I noticed the timeline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="727">does not really look like the rest of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="727">Chrome. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="730">We implemented it in WebKit, we were using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="730">these colorful gradients, 3D loops, we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">really do that in Chrome, so I needed to fix </span><span class="line" data-startTime="733">it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="738">And when you were working in a UI like that, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="738">you need to go back and forth between the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">page and your source code until what you see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="741">satisfies you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="746">Let's try to recreate this experience right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="746">now. I'm recording a couple of timelines in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">here, and if you can see those gray zebra </span><span class="line" data-startTime="752">bars in the central part of the timeline, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">let me make them a bit more conscious for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="761">you. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="763">To do that I'm using the inspect element tool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="763">to locate the actual code responsible for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">the zebra bar. And in here I can play around </span><span class="line" data-startTime="770">with its colors using the color meter. Let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="776">me increase it or maybe play with the color. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="776">And I can do it dynamically in here. I have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">a range of values I am choosing. And that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="784">really a simplistic example of what Bret was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">talking about, because as I go through these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="790">ranges I was just going to bump the conscious </span><span class="line" data-startTime="794">a bit, but now I like the different color </span><span class="line" data-startTime="794">I can accept it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="799">Let's check if the sources were updated. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="799">they were updated, so that's my new color. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="806">Nice. But I think we have a bug because in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="806">the top part of this grid you can see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">overview. It also has the zebra bar, but it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="812">was not updated. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="817">We are probably doing a bad job, we don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="817">use constants here or the style we're using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="821">is different. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="821">Let me do the same thing with the top area. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="825">So I inspect it. Whoa. That's not CSS, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="825">it's not going to work like that. We all love </span><span class="line" data-startTime="835">CSS because it's declarative language.

And it searches </span><span class="line" data-startTime="863">through all my source project, and through </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">the entire project. As you can see, we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="870">a number of components that are using canvas, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">but I think the timeline overview pane is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="876">the one that I need, so I'm jumping to it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="885">And while we are here let me say a few words </span><span class="line" data-startTime="885">about the new sources panel. So the sources </span><span class="line" data-startTime="890">panel is the one where you are dealing with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="890">your source code. You are going to view it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">there, you are going to modify it there, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="894">are going to save it there, you're going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">jump on to the source code from your URL, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="898">so we need more real estate for that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="902">For that we now have collapsible debugger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="902">sidebars and expandable tree view with all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">of your sources. And remember Web scales you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="910">need a lot of space for the list of your files. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="916">But do you know what? You don't really need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="916">it at all times on your screen because you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="920">can hit command O and jump to any file instantly. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="920">As I type, the list narrows down and I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">jump into a particular file or even a particular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="927">line number. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="933">[ Applause ] </span></p>

And any subsequent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1061">execution of that code was using the new code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1068">Now, let's see if the local modifications, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1068">it's a context menu in here or in the scripts </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1074">navigator to the left, captured our changes. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1074">And of course, they are here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1081">Now, let's see if we actually like them.

Applying </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1092">the revision content. I'm keeping the changes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1092">again. So as you can see, you can experiment </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1098">with the revisions of your edited source files, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1098">be it JavaScript or CSS. Now that we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">edited all, we need to save it. And for that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1105">we are going to use context menu and save </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">as. Here you can bind your source file to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1111">the file system location and all of the subsequent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1116">saves are going to write to that location. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1116">Or you can do something more interesting. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">You can actually install an extension, Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1122">extension, from the Web store. I'm using a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1128">(indiscernible) device devtools have to save </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1128">for that.

The image </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1337">that Sam has been clicking. You can see it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1344">big in here.

For example, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1360">let's go to the network. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1360">While I'm on the network panel, I'm pressing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1364">command R, to reload the target page.

Let's say you want something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">more complex. You want to see how the cell </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1403">phone performs on your tasks. So I'm reloading </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1410">the YouTube again, and timeline shows me not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1410">only network events but also the style recalculation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">or JavaScript execution that happened on this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1416">very CPU architecture, different from my box, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">at this very CPU this handset is running. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1422">Or even more fun stuff. Let's do some breakpoints </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1430">in here. I'm going to set a breakpoint.

The only problem being </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1620"> &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1620"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Override. You &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1621"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Sorry, I left the override on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1621">there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1624"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Yeah. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1624"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Okay, just refresh that. And, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1628">yeah, so what you can do here is use touchevents, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1628">but, you know, it doesn't work obviously. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">What we have in the tools is the ability now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1632">to emulate touchevents and you can set breakpoints </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1638">and so on, there we have it. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1638">I'm using touch there on the desktop device. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1643">So, yeah, really handy tool. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1643"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: So you were just dragging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1646">your mouse and it was emulating the touch. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1646"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Right, yeah, that's good stuff. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1656">So, um, I would like to just kind of I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1656">know shift focus a little bit now. We've talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1661">a lot about the parts of the tools that make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1661">your life easier as a developer. Also, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1667">know, thinking about the users of your apps. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1667">What's in it for them? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">And, you know, particularly in this world </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1673">we have now where users really come to expect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1677">from Web apps these, you know, these new features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1677">that really push the limits of the CPU and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1683">GPU and memory and so on and, you know, in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1683">that context, in particular, how do we &mdash; how </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">do we measure responsiveness? You know, this </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1690">idea like what is it, how do we measure it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1697">And luckily, we have some tools for that. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1697">I was thinking in particular, you know, a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1703">website you may have seen called HTML5rocks. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1703">It's got a really nice interface, really great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">content. But we've noticed some, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1710">just slight stuttering, it's hard to see here. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1714">But some slight stuttering with scrolling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1714">on the page and, you know, the thing was coming </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1721">at that problem &mdash; you know, there are a million </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1721">things it could have been. And what I wanted </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">to know from Pavel is how do we approach that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1725">problem where you really kind of have no idea </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1730">where to start. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1730">So, yeah, I thought maybe you could give us </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1734">hints there. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1734"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Yeah, of course. So you start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">with the timeline when you don't know what's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1736">happening in the page, especially if you have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">performance issues in the page, you start </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1740">with the timeline. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1743">So let us record a timeline in here. I will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1743">do devtools to get a bit more real estate </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1750">in here. And in the timeline, I am pressing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1750">record the record button and I go to the page, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">and I scroll it a bit, and then I go back </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1756">and turn off the recording. So what I can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">see here, let me zoom into a window here. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1763">What I can see here is a lot of events are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">happening within the browser. And timeline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1768">not only shows us the JavaScript events, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">shows all of the native events, styles, painting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1773">everything that happens in the browser. While </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">hovering over these elements, you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1779">what is actually taking time. Yellow is scripting, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1784">blue is loading, we didn't have any and green </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1784">is painting. So this picture gives you a very </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1789">good understanding of what's slow. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1789"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Yeah. That's good. That's good. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1794">I mean, the only problem is, you know, I remember </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1794">when I first saw this timeline thing I thought, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">wow, that's lot of information. But it's kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1800">of useless, you know. It's like where do we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">go from there? It doesn't really give me a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1804">picture of what's happening each time there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1808">a slowness &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1808"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: I give up. So we've gotten </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1811">exactly this feedback from you and we thought </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1811">we need something better. And with this version </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1816">of Chrome we are introducing a new frame mode </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1816">of the timeline. Let me zoom into a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">of frames. So with these frame mode in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1822">timeline, we are defining a new term, a frame. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1827">And the frame is the amount of time that the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1827">browser needs to update the screen. It includes </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1834">everything. JavaScript processing, recalculation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1834">of the styles, painting, everything is happening </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">within the single frame and then your user </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1839">sees the picture. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1843">You can see the same nice color coding in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1843">here. Green is paint, purple is layout, styles </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">and the yellow is scripting. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="1849">But more importantly, we set a baseline to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1854">you. And this baseline is 60-hertz. 60 frames </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1854">per second. That's what browser expects from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1861">you. You need to generate 60 frames each second. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1861">It gives you only 16 milliseconds per frame. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1868">That's the same vsync signal that we've been </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1868">talking about on the keynote. Now, if we look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">at this very page, we can see that the frame </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1874">was taking, in fact, 45 milliseconds. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1881">And it is above the baseline of the 60 frames </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1881">per second. This solid line in the middle. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="1888">So it's not JavaScript in your case. It's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1888">not styles. It's the paint. You must be painting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1894">something very beautiful. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1894"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Yeah, yeah, no I know. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1897">[Laughter]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1897"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: What I know is the culprit is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1900">&mdash; yeah, some there's some heavy duty CSS </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1900">in there, a lot of gradients. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1906"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Oh, I know! [Laughter] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1906"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Aesthetic. Nice background image. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1912"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: I know it's nice, but it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1912">slow. I removed all of them, and the page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">still has that background. What's wrong? Okay. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1918">Let's inspect. Oh, are there are more. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1925">[Laughter] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1925"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: And those are the same. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1927">are using all over again the same gradients. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1927"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Twice is good. [Laughter]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1933"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Okay. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1933">Maybe it was making it slow. Okay. Anyways, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">now that I've disabled everything and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1936">can't really tell the difference, can you? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1941">Let me go back to the timeline and start recording. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1941">And let me scroll here a bit. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">Go back and stop my timeline. [Laughter]. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1947">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1951"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: There's nice 16 milliseconds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1951">frame, thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1958"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Yeah, okay, well done. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1958">Audience member: [ Inaudible - no mic ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1964"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Okay. Let's take it to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1964">Q and A. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1967">Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1967"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Yeah, and if you want to learn </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">more about that stuff, after us there's the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1972">jank buster session. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1977">It will go into more detail. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="1977"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Right. So that was smooth </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1980">animations. Wrapping up, please measure performance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1980">of your animations and scrolling. Now we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">a good baseline, 16 milliseconds, you will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1986">know for sure, (indiscernible) smooth has </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1991">now a value, it's 60. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1991">Use this time wisely. Think as game developers. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">Game developers don't have much time for a </span><span class="line" data-startTime="1997">frame. Tools will help you narrowing down </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2002">the problem, whether it's paint or JavaScript. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2002">After you know the paint events and you need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2007">to bisect those, regress, find where the culprit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2007">is. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">For the JavaScript we have better tools. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2011">will point you to the very line of the source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2015">code that is updating the layout or recalculating </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2015">styles. So you will know what is wrong. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2021">And as Sam mentioned, in this very room, right </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2021">after ours, there is going to be an extended </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">session on the frames mode for the timeline </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2026">and the GPU team from Chrome is going to drive </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2032">it. So make sure you don't miss it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2032"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Yeah, great stuff. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2036">Of course, Pavel was kind of cheating there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2036">You know, you can always just delete stuff </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2040">to make a web app work faster. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2040"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: You can? [Laughter]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2045"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: That's true. But, you know, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2045">I mean we all know that these situations, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2050">as much as you optimize everything, all your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2050">code, you get to a point sometimes where you've </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">got some code that is just inherently CPU </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2055">intensive, long running. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2058">And, you know, I was thinking about how to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2058">use the devtools to deal with that. And I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">was thinking of &mdash; you know, the prettyprint </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2065">function itself. What I have noticed with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2069">that is that, you know, it's obviously doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2069">a lot of work but it doesn't seem to freeze </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">up the interface, so I have asked Pavel about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2074">how that works. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2077"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Right, so it does use more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2077">than 16 milliseconds of time. We are using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">WebWorkers to move the work off into the other </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2082">thread. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2085"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Okay, Yeah. I mean, I always </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2085">feel like I should use WebWorkers. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2089"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Do you use WebWorkers? Not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2089">much, okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2093"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: But I always sort of shy away </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2093">from it, because I feel like they are hard </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2097">to debug, you know, like where do you start? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2097"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Oh, is it? [Laughter]. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2103"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Let's try that. As I mentioned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2103">we will be focusing on the WebWorkers, so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2109">let me go back to the page where we were debugging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2109">devtools, for the devtools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2114">We will be interested in the source code. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2114">Do we have any? Well, let's reload. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2120">Let's get some. Yeah, we've got some files. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2120">Okay. So here is the source code. As you probably </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2127">know, when you press this little button, it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2127">gets prettyprinted, really nice. And as I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">mentioned, it happens in the worker. So let's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2133">try going ahead and debug it. I'm going to </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2138">the debugger sidebar, under the workers tab </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2138">I choose to pause on start. So what it should </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">do, when the worker is created for your page, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2147">it should stop it before the very first statement </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2152">this worker executes. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2152">And we should be able to debug it. Let's try </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2159">it out. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2159">Okay. Now that we have three windows with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2164">the devtools on the screen, I feel I must </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2164">go over them again. So the one to the left, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2169">is your Web page. It's just me, I have the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2169">devtools, sorry. One to the right is the devtools. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2174">And the one in the middle is the devtools </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2174">for the worker. [Laughter]. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2178"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Got it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2178"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Yeah, is that okay? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">Right. So I can step through the execution </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2182">here and I can see that I'm debugging the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">worker. The worker is stopped. But he can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2188">scroll the page. So the page is not blocked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2196">by the worker. So this is not the fake worker </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2196">emulation using iFrames, this is the real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2201">stuff, native workers being debugged. Now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2201">of course you can use all of the debugging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">functions in here or you can go and collect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2206">CPU profiles or take heap snapshots, do the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">timeline for the worker or use console. This </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2213">devtools window is working in the context </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">of your worker. And if you type window in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2219">here, there is no window and there's no document. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2228">Who are you? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2228">[Laughter] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2231"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: It is dedicated worker context. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2231">So this is in fact the worker object. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">Now, we support debugging workers, the dedicated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2237">workers and the shared workers. And the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">to start debugging shared workers is to visit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2243">Chrome Inspect. That's where all of the inspectable </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">properties of Chrome are represented, be it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2251">page or an extension or a background page, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2256">application, shared worker, everything you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2256">can start from here. You click inspect and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2260">you are brought to the right window. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2260">So that's the WebWorker story. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2267">[ Applause ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2267"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: I may even use them now. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">talked a lot about memory, but of course, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2275">there's always some kind of tradeoff with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">performance. Well, or is there? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2282">We did some testing of Google Web apps, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2291">you can see on the graph here, the yellow </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2291">line at the top there represents overtime </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">memory consumption, and the blue with a high </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2298">level variance represents the measure of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2306">projection of latency. One thing we're finding </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2306">with Web apps, I think this is a common experience </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2313">now, people are using Web Apps for much longer </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2313">than they used to. We have users of Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">Apps like running them for days. So you need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2318">to be aware of that. What we learned was obviously </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2327">that there were memory leaks and that we could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2327">fix, and the most common source of that was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2333">problematic &mdash; in fact, it was problematic </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2333">usage of event listeners. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2337"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Okay. So I think we have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2337">some tools for that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2342"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Yeah, indeed. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2342"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: And we're going to explore </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2346">a simple example of the memory leak, and &mdash; </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2346"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: That's a lovely website. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2351"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Yeah. So I'm going to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2351">source, and let us see the source code. So </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2359">what it does is every time I click "say hello", </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2359">it creates an element. Hello, there. And it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2367">adds it to the result. But then in a second </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2367">it just removed them all. But they all are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2375">still here in this array. Let's see how the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2375">tool handles that memory leak case. But now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">let's imagine we don't know it all and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2382">start from scratch. Can you forget everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2387">that I've just said? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2387">I'm going to start recording the timeline, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2392">and a number of clicks in here, and let me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2392">undock the timeline. Oops. And we are going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2404">to look at the memory view for it, and let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2404">me face the window. What you can see here </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2409">is the heap graph. That's the memory your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2409">app is consuming at the top, so it's a bit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2415">more than a megabyte. Then there is a regular </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2415">timeline, and then there is the memory counters, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2421">DOM counters, and event list counters represented </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2421">in here. You can see that the number of DOM </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">notes increased from 18 to 24 as I was clicking, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2427">and the document is still alone, and there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2435">are two new event listeners in here. If I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2435">click on the step, I will see that there is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2443">an event associated with that. So every time </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2443">it grows, there is some event in here, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2452">indeed the link, we can hover over and jump </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2452">to the line that was creating that object, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2459">of course, but more importantly we now know </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2459">what user action is causing the leak. Now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2466">that we know what is the problem, we'll find </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2466">the actual location of that object. And for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2475">that we turn to the profiler, and in the profiler, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2475">I'm going to &mdash; let me go back to the page. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2483">I'm going to take a heap snapshot. Let me </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2483">say hello a few more times and take another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2491">heap snapshot, and let's see what it is all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2491">about. So the heap snapshot is in fact the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2498">snapshot of the JavaScript heap of running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2498">application. And the summary view that I'm </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2505">looking at is the summary for the heap where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2505">all the objects are grouped by their type. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2511">For example, those are API functions and those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2511">are date objects. Those are Chrome events. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2518">So everything is grouped in here. For each </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2518">of the objects I can see &mdash; for each of the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2524">group I can see the object count, shadow size </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2524">and the retain size, so its own size and the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2530">size of the tree it is holding. Now, if I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2530">go to the second snapshot, that was taken </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2537">after my actions that are supposed to leak, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2537">I can compare it to the first one. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2548">[ APPLAUSE ] </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2548">And in the comparison mode, I can see that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2556">there are 7 new objects. And if I hover over </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2556">these objects, you get this hover card that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2562">you got used to while debugging, and if I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2562">select this object, it will show me the retaining </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2568">trees for this object. Those are the guys </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2568">that reference my object. And those are the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2574">real cause of the memory leak. In this case, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2574">I have an array. And in its 13th slot there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">is this paragraph element, and, you know these </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2582">dollar zero that refers the currently selected </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2589">element in the elements panel, it also works </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2589">in here. So from this panel you can jump into </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2596">the source &mdash; into the console, into the running </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2596">object and explore it there. Let's see what </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2602">is holding this array? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2602">It's a window. It's a global object. And the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2606">property name on it is "holding", so if I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2606">do dollar zero, that's my window, and if I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2613">do dollar zero holding, that's the array that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2613">was holding the paragraph element. So to recap </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2623">that, if you don't know where your memory </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2623">leak is or where is the unbonded cache that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2629">you're using, you should go to the time line, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2629">then you perform your actions and look at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2635">the spikes in the DOM node counters. There </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2635">is also garbage collection button that you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2641">can press in the timeline to collect the garbage </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2641">that should bring everything back to normal. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2646">If it doesn't, this means you have a leak. </span></p>

<p><span class="line" data-startTime="2646">Now that you have tracked down the user scenario </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2652">that is responsible for your leak, start using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2652">the heap profiler. You take a heap snapshot, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2658">then you do your action, you take another </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2658">snapshot and then you compare the two. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2664">once you've seen the leak objects, the objects </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2664">that should not be there, look for suspicious </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2668">classes that you own the code, you know it. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2668">Then track the retainers in the bottom part </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2674">of the screen to track them to the global </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2674">objects and you will see the exact path that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2679">is leaking memory. There are more complicated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2679">techniques for finding memory leaks that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2685">more efficient such as three snapshot technology </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2685">where you take three snapshots, then you look </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2691">at the third, and filter out everything that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2691">has been allocated between one and two, or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2698">actually show everything that has been allocated </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2698">between one and two, but it's a different </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2702">technique. It's more complex. It's beyond </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2702">this session, but we are here at the Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2706">booth, so if you have questions there, make </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2706">sure you come and ask them there. Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2712"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Thanks very much, Pavel, really </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2712">useful tools for dealing with memory as well </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2717">as performance. We don't have much more time, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2717">but I just wanted to mention a couple of more </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2723">features that have come into the tools now, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2723">really useful stuff, particularly in relation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2727">to clientside story. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2727"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: It's not the end. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2730"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Have a look at the features </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2730">for index DB and App Cache. Have you seen </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2735">the web components? We have great tools for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2735">shadow DOM inspection, just go to the elements </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2739">panel and drill down into an element and you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2739">will see the shadow DOM compliance. It's great </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2746">stuff. My favorite thing of all, Pavel wouldn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2746">let me demonstrate is source maps. These are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2752">really easy to work with, you know, you use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2752">a tool like closure to minify your code, at </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2757">the same time you make a source map file, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2757">you put a link to the source map file in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2763">minified code, and that's it. When you use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2763">that code in the devtools, you'll see the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2769">human readable version seamlessly in place. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2769">It makes life much easier. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2772"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Come on. Come on. How can </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2772">you love a feature like that? Here is my favorite </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2777">one. Here is the WebKit, right? Let us go </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2777">back there. No, let's do Google. So in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2787">Dev Tools, right, I'm a developer, and where </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2787">is everything in here? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2791">Okay. And there's Google, and sometimes I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2791">am ambitious and I kind of think, okay, let </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2797">me change things here, and it will be a Google </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2797">search, supersearch &mdash; it didn't apply. Why? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2806">They are fooling me. Come on. Do it again. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2806"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: That's weird. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2813"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Yeah. Oh, it wasn't title. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="2813">Okay. Sorry. I'm feeling very lucky. Are you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2819">working for me? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2819">Okay. Good. Then I have more ambitious, I </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2822">think. Okay. So that color is not &mdash; I want </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2822">a red one. And then I think, okay, this Nexus </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2829">7 is really cool. I actually go and list the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2829">font size for it, and do the shift up. Yeah, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2839">and I think, okay, so this is enough clutter </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2839">here, right? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">I need to get rid of it, and go and delete </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2844">it all, and you know what, the search field, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">I don't like it either. I'll just delete it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2847">all. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2849"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: That's too complex. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2849"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Come on. And then I think, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2850">okay, I've done a lot &mdash; why can't I delete </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2850">it? Come on, Google, where is it? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2860">Yeah. And I think, okay, that's enough, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2860">then I calm down, I think I like it the way </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2869">it was, and I press command C and things are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2869">undone, or I press shift command C and things </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2877">are redone. So we have the complete undo-redo </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2877">stuck in here that is more importantly retaining </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2885">the identity of the nodes, so when I'm deleting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2885">nodes or recreating nodes, those are the same </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2891">objects, and your JavaScript points there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2891">and your program remains functional with that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2896">So that's a cool feature. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2896">[ APPLAUSE ] </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2902"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Go back. Go back.

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2906"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: No, I won't show you.

The question mark </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2910">is where you get all the shortcuts to all </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2914">the features that we have, the ones with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2914">shortcuts, including the ones that go to file, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2920">go to line, and goes to your font size. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2980"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I thought of one more question, you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2983">taking requests for improvements to devtools. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2983">Remote debugging is really cool, but it doesn't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2987">work when you're offline, because it hits </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2987">app spot first.

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="2991"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: So I can give you advice </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2994">how to work around it, and then we'll fix </span><span class="line" data-startTime="2994">it. So the workaround is to save that page </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3001">that is served alt app engine, and it's just </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3001">a Web app, and you save it, you open it, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3006">you point to your Chrome instance or your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3006">mobile instance and it will work. No need </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3012">for a cloud there. Okay? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3012"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Is there a way to see the packets in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3019">Web socket? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3019"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Yes, in fact you can see </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3023">the packets on the Web socket. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3023">And let me show it to you, so that's &mdash; okay. </span> <span class="line" data-startTime="3033">I'm going to use a &mdash; we are using those, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3033">right, for the devtool itself, where are you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3037">&mdash; where are you? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3037">Okay. So I'll need to do devtool on devtool </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3044">on devtool, but that's probably fine. You </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3044">got used to it. And in the network, I don't </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3053">need to record. I'll just do some stuff. And </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3053">you should see the packets in here, and if </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3063">they aren't, we just can't find them, so the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3063">idea is that you can see the resource responsible </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3069">for the Web socket packet in here, and in </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3069">the editing part of this screen, you will </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3075">see Web socket frames tab.

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3085"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi, thank you guys for the presentation. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3090">It was real cool. So I have a question: Is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3090">it possible to simulate the http request that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3098">like that made from UI, or, you know, you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3098">click a button, you have a bunch of requests, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3105">is it possible to simulate a bunch of them </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3105">and override some headers, override a script </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3110">that can do it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3110"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Not yet. XHR replay simulation </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3116">is very high in our to-do list, so we are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3116">going to make it soon, but it's not there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3122">yet. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3122"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Yeah, lots of people are asking </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3125">for that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3125"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3127"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So do these techniques &mdash; I mean the kind </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3127">of examples that you showed were a little </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3130">bit, you know, contrived obviously for the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3130">demo, but let's say Gmail, does Gmail use </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3136">the Chrome devtools in the same way that you're </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3136">doing it or do they use different tools or </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3141">do they have different techniques in how they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3141">use the tools, you know, for debugging and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3147">just working with that system, because there's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3147">literally, you know, dozens if not hundreds </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3150">of events happening per second in the timeline, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3150">the heap snapshots will have, you know, tons </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3155">of different things, does it scale to something </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3155">at that level? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3158"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Gmail is our best in-house </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3158">client so we're working with them a lot. These </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3164">three snapshot techniques with the heap profiling </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3164">was in fact &mdash; those were discovered while </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3169">working with the Gmail team while they were </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3169">hunting their memory leaks. They're also using </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3175">timeline and, of course, they're using RD </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3175">bugger. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3178"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So it does. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3178"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Yes. Of course. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3181"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3181"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Hi, is there a good way to inspect, edit </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3186">CSS key frames, the CSS animation key frames? </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3186">Because you can &mdash; you can see the define </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3193">animation, but I want to see the key frames, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3193">edit them, and then look at performance issues. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3198"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: So the best you can get is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3198">just jumping to the source code and editing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3203">them there. Everything you do in the source </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3203">code is immediately reflected in the screen. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3208"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3208"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: But there is no structural </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3211">editing for the key frames and for media queries </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3211">yet. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3213"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. And then is there a way to trigger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3213">them, force them to rerun in a performance </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3218">tracing kind of context. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3218"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Of course. You can edit everything </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3221">in here, and then you just save, and then </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3221">you go to the timeline and you perform those </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3225">actions and they will be using these new styles. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3225">Okay, thank you. Is the mobile debugging going </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3235">to be available on Chrome for IOS? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3235"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: I don't know. We'll have </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3241">to check. So the remote debugging background </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3241">is a part of WebKit, so the code is there. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3247">I believe there is a way to remove the debugger </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3247">IOS devices. I don't know about the Chrome, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3255">but I can find it out for you, and e-mail </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3255">that, I'll send it back to you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3262"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3262"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: And you talked earlier about getting below </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3265">60 frames a second, there was I think green, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3265">purple and blue were colors that you talked </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3269">about, and when you got below they all turned </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3269">gray. What was the gray for? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3272"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Okay, so here is the thing: </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3272">The frame for us is everything that beginning </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3280">of the frames, and the gray that you saw above </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3280">is the CPU activity that we do not instrument, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3288">or it's an idle time. We are working on distinguishing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3288">between the two, so very soon we will be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3294">to say this is the CPU. It has been doing </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3294">something. Or this is idle, the other tasks </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3302">are using it. So we are actively working on </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3302">the timeline, on the frame mode, and it's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3307">very first revision of it. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3307"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: So if it's gray and it is the CPU that's </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3311">doing it, it's your app that is causing that </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3311">CPU to spin up but you don't know why? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3314"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Right, the spikes that we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3314">saw on the timeline, the gray one, transparent </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3319">one, were related to the CPU related to the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3319">switching in windows that I was doing as the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3326">timeline was captured, so that was idle from </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3326">your page perspective, because it was not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3331">wasting CPU resources, so we will be able </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3331">to cut that down soon and tell you that your </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3336">page is not responsible for it. But the picture </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3336">that we show is accurate from the repaint </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3342">perspective, from the frame perspective, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3342">something has been happening and your frame </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3347">has not been painted at that time, so there </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3347">was indeed a jank in the repaint. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3354"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Thank you. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3354"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Is there any plans on integrating a &mdash; like </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3360">a testing framework into the devtool so, say, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3360">macros and assertions and these kinds of things. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3367"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: So we have a nice extensions </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3367">API support where we add extensions for you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3373">to be able to build your own panel in the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3373">devtool, or to react upon selection of an </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3379">element in the elements panel and such. We </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3379">might extend those APIs if they are not sufficient </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3384">for achieving your goals. So we &mdash; yeah, we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3384">are &mdash; we are relying upon the third parties </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3391">to provide the functional like that. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3391"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: All right, so there's no &mdash; right now </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3394">on that direct like roadmap, there's no plans </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3394">for a testing framework essentially? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3398"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Right. Those would be done </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3398">through the extensions at least at the first </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3402">page. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3402"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, cool, thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3406"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: I'm an engineer on the Google+ team, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3406">first of all, I just want to say thanks so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3410">much for these tools, I couldn't do my job </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3410">without them. I mean, they're just a real </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3413">joy to use, they make Web development fun </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3413">again. That said, we do obviously have a pretty </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3421">massively large JavaScript application and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3421">it's compiling files together and it's starting </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3426">across all that, so at least the search across </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3426">sources made it easier again to figure out </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3431">where that JavaScript is coming from, but </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3431">just loading it in and parsing it still is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3436">pretty pokey, it's many &mdash; I'm just curious </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3436">how optimized that stuff is and how much you </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3441">think you can improve the performance even </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3441">further when you have really large JavaScript? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3444"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: All right, so, by the moment Gmail was </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3444">our like largest client, so whenever they </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3450">hit the limitation, they came to us and we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3450">fixed it, and please, do that as well, and </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3455">we'll be improving. So right now with the </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3455">frame mode, we found that we have a lot of </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3460">junk in our own UI, and we do know a couple </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3460">of little knocks related to the scale with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3465">our text viewer. We are comfortable at about </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3465">100K lines. When it goes beyond we are not </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3472">that comfortable from the memory standpoint, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3472">but those are all fixable, so as we hit new </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3477">limitations, we are fixing them, so please </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3477">provide your feedback. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3479"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay, great. Will do. Thanks. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3479"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Question from this side. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3484"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: We've been writing some code that runs </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3484">on both node.js and the client, since node.js </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3490">using V8 does it have any association with </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3490">this, or is this purely the clientside browser? </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3495"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: Right. This is working against </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3495">the WebKit based browsers primarily, so it </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3502">does not work against V8 or node. There is </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3502">a solution that works against node, because </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3508">node supports &mdash; exposes the V8 debugging </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3508">protocol. There's a project called Chrome </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3513">devtool for Java that is an eclipse plug-in, </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3513">and eclipse has indicated that can connect </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3522">both to Chrome and to raw V8 including node. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3522">I know that there is a fork of Web inspector </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3529">that works a pretty old font that works against </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3529">node, and I know there are people that are </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3536">trying to implement wrappers around V8 so </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3536">that they emulated the remote debugging protocol </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3542">that Chrome devtool is using so that we could </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3542">connect there, but that is a work in progress. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3547"><span class="speakerName">Audience member</span>: Okay. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3547"><span class="speakerName">Pavel Feldman</span>: So it's Chrome devtools for </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3549">Java and that is an eclipse plug-in. </span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="line" data-starttime="3549"><span class="speakerName">Sam Dutton</span>: Thanks very much. I think we </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3555">better wrap it up. We've run out of time. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3555">Thanks again. Thanks also for the live feature </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3562">request earlier. We'll take note of that. </span><span class="line" data-startTime="3562">Thank you. </span></p>
