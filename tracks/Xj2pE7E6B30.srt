00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome to "Google Developers
Weekly" for October 7, 2013.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,080
I'm Louis Gray, and this is our
highlight reel of what's

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,260
happening in the world
of Google Developers,

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,270
on the set and off.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,400
As you know, social is a key
ingredient in today's

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,560
applications.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,790
Getting social network
integration just right can

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,010
delight your users, but getting
it wrong could get a

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,065
big mistake.

10
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:24,590
Nazmul Idris and Don Dodge get
social and tell us just how to

11
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,760
strike the right balance.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,430
Mano Marks put his location
marker in Mountain View and

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,920
taught us how to get started
with the Google

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,780
Maps SDK for iOS.

15
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,960
This quick tutorial guides
you on how to set up your

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,770
development environment, test
an API key, and create that

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,460
first application.

18
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,040
From Milan, Google Developer
expert Mauro Solcia explained

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,690
how to create your first app
that displays information from

20
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,610
files stored in Google Drive and
display them on a web page

21
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,470
using JavaScript.

22
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,140
Back in Mountain View, Josh
Livni and Felipe Hoffa gave us

23
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,740
a glimpse into the future of
air travel using Google

24
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,120
BigQuery and the Google Maps
JavaScript API visualizing

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,500
correlations.

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,650
And traveling to a place that
knows quite a bit about

27
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,950
clouds, not to mention rain, we
find ourselves at the first

28
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,390
event taped in our new
Seattle studio.

29
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,190
Brian Dorsey provided us with a
quick introduction to Google

30
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,060
Compute Engine load balancing.

31
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,340
Watch for many more clouds
in this space.

32
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,950
From Tel Aviv, Ido Green showed
us the power of the

33
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,940
Google Eclipse plug-in and how
you can push your code to App

34
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,330
Engine with only two clicks.

35
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,310
And as we like to say,
live from New York.

36
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,590
Ikai Lan debuted the new home
of YouTube API samples on

37
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,190
GitHub at GitHub.com/YouTube.

38
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,960
The event walks through why we
made the move, our project

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,220
setup, and shows basic commands
and GUI tools to get

40
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,620
you up and running.

41
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,520
From Buenos Aires, Nick
Bortolotti and his dog return

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,840
with "GDL LatAm" talking
App Engine.

43
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,050
Watch Nick's talk and learn
about how the Focus Ninja can

44
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,330
make your projects better.

45
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,010
Closing out the week in our
studios in Mountain View, we

46
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,350
hosted the MEAN stack
of MongoDB,

47
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,080
Express, Node.JS and AngularJS.

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,490
Google Engineering Director
Brad Green connected with

49
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,710
leaders from MongoDB, Breeze.js,
and StrongLoop to

50
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,479
talk about making managing data
simpler, even in mobile

51
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,050
enterprise environments.

52
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,990
And it wouldn't be a full report
if I didn't highlight

53
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,330
the fantastic work being done
by our teammates in Android

54
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,610
Developers Live.

55
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,780
This week saw a new "Android
Design in Action," a new

56
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,587
"GameOn!" episode with Todd
Kerpleman, and a trio of

57
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:22,480
DevBites aimed at improving
your applications

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,700
through best practices.

59
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,292
Check out all their videos
at Developers.Googl

60
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:29,170
e.com/Live/Android.

61
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,340
And news flash--

62
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,340
not everybody in the world
speaks English.

63
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,770
Because of that, Google recently
worked with Udacity

64
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,960
to translate many of its web
application MOOCs into Spanish

65
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,610
and Brazilian Portuguese.

66
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,930
Captioned versions of several
videos are now available.

67
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,180
[SPANISH].

68
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,820

69
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,390
And this week we launched a
Google+ community for Cloud

70
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,650
Platform developers.

71
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,970
We're looking for comments,
videos, questions and all

72
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,370
other kinds of content
in the new community.

73
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,190
And what better place than the
cloud for a community about

74
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,360
developing in the cloud?

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,430
For those of you building
sharing into your iOS

76
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,300
applications, we just enabled
you to upgrade the Google+

77
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,210
sharing experience
inside your apps.

78
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,030
The Google+ iOS SDK now enables
you to use a native

79
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,770
share box including image
and video attachments.

80
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,060
Best of all, this only requires
you to change a

81
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,170
single line of source code.

82
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,660
See the new Google+ iOS SDK for
this and other updates.

83
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,630
And when it comes to memory
leaks, you hate them, we hate

84
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,040
them, your users hate them.

85
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,590
In our mutual never-ending quest
for future memory leaks,

86
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,860
we've released a new doc on
memory profiling for your

87
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,370
JavaScript apps.

88
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,250
Read a little, and save
your own memory.

89
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,780
And we were really in a
documenting mood this week.

90
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,720
Over on the Google Maps
JavaScript API, we launched

91
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,270
new documents that show
you how to add

92
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,660
overlays to your maps.

93
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,380
Check out the docs and sample
code to see how to put shapes,

94
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,720
markers and info windows
on the map.

95
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,120
And to make sure that you never
miss a thing from the

96
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,550
world of Google Developers,
subscribe to Google Developers

97
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,370
on YouTube.

98
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,830
And check out the GDL schedule
at developers.google.com/live.

99
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,385
I'm Louis Gray, and I'll see
you back in the studio.

100
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:08,778
