00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,007

2
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:08,840
ALEXIS MP: Hi there.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,180
We're here back at Devoxx.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,610
Exciting conference so
far, lots of content.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,250
I have with me the Chrome guys.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,110
So I have Joe, I have Francois.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,660
These guys have been here
talking about Chrome Apps.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,190
And I'll start with you Joe.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,100
Can you tell us what
Chrome Apps are, even?

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,297
And how they differ
from maybe, real apps?

11
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,880
JOE MARINI: So they're
relatively new.

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,160
We officially launched
them back in September.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
We've been developing them
for a couple of years now.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,220
Essentially, Chrome
Apps are a way

15
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,400
to use HTML5 to develop real,
native-feeling applications.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,880
Applications that look
and feel like native ones.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,200
They run outside the browser.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,800
They work offline by default.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,840
They work on desktop
as well as mobile.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,410
So it's a great
way for developers

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,530
to build real
native experiences.

22
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,940
ALEXIS MP: A lot of things
you covered briefly here.

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,455
You want to cover
the offline part?

24
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:02,080
What does it really
mean to be offline?

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,038
JOE MARINI: Yeah, sure.

26
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:05,269
So we're all familiar with
building web applications,

27
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:05,769
right?

28
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:06,484
So you use HTML5.

29
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:07,775
You build your web application.

30
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,010
It's online.

31
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,520
So when you build
a Chrome app, you

32
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,860
build it the same way,
HTML5, JavaScript, CSS.

33
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,020
But all the resources
are packaged up locally

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,860
into an application.

35
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,740
It's local on your machine
like an installed app is.

36
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,339
And you can run the app
when you're not connected,

37
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:24,380
or when you have a connection
that's not so good,

38
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,570
and it just behaves normally.

39
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,810
ALEXIS MP: Great, so
that's really, obviously,

40
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,710
very important.

41
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,920
Another thing is you can
access computer, the laptop,

42
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,200
or the machine's resources,
as in the USB port,

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,220
or the file system,
and stuff like that.

44
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,090
So that brings up
the ability to build

45
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,635
a whole new range
of applications.

46
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:46,430
Which typically a
web app could not.

47
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,050
JOE MARINI: We leverage
HTML5 wherever possible.

48
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,030
But when HTML5 does not
provide a certain feature,

49
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,040
we have Chrome app
APIs that fill in,

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,512
for things like file access, and
USB and Bluetooth, and sockets.

51
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:02,720
ALEXIS MP: So one of the
reasons I have Francois here

52
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,219
with us also is that's Francois
has been doing some of that,

53
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,220
which is integrating
with some of the hardware

54
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,180
available on machines.

55
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,289
Do you want to tell
us more about what

56
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,340
you're doing here at Devoxx?

57
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,340
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: One
guy, actually in Google,

58
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,420
named Louis, built an
awesome library on JavaScript

59
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,960
to be able to communicate
with those USB NFC reader.

60
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,590
So what we've done is, we've
built a Chrome app which

61
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,130
helps with registration.

62
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,542
And basically those tie here.

63
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,750
ALEXIS MP: So the wristbands
that everybody has here.

64
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,000
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And you
can scan it and write to it

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,600
directly from a Chrome app,
only with web technologies.

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,300
That's just awesome.

67
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,180
ALEXIS MP: It's used
here for registration,

68
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,260
for delivering the
wristbands, checking what's

69
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,160
on those wristbands, which is
used throughout the conference.

70
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,379
And we use those on Chromebooks.

71
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,670
But that could be on any
machine that's running Chrome,

72
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,461
which kind of brings
me to the question of,

73
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:54,657
how are these packaged
and delivered?

74
00:02:54,657 --> 00:02:55,740
I mean, those Chrome Apps.

75
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,420
JOE MARINI: So
basically, it depends.

76
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,720
On desktop machines, they
are packaged up as zip files

77
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,957
and they are stored in
the Chrome Web Store.

78
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:04,540
And so you go to the
Chrome Web Store,

79
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,510
you download and
install the application,

80
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,390
and it's the same
as you download

81
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,330
an app from any other app store.

82
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,010
On mobile, we use
the Cordova library

83
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,310
to package up applications
as native apps.

84
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,320
So they're basically native
apps that host your web code.

85
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,730
And they get packaged as a
native app for that platform.

86
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,980
So for Google, they
go in the Play Store.

87
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,542
For iOS they go in
the Apple App Store.

88
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,500
So depending on whether
it's desktop or mobile,

89
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,970
that's how they get delivered.

90
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,840
ALEXIS MP: How real are
Chrome Apps today on mobile?

91
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,160
How far along are we?

92
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,690
JOE MARINI: Well, it's
really early days right now.

93
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,930
We have a team of
people in Canada,

94
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,460
in Waterloo, that are working
on contributing to the Cordova

95
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,830
effort.

96
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,320
We've got a good set of the
core APIs ported over now.

97
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,920
We think that
probably by early 2014

98
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,500
we should be in good
shape for people

99
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,040
to start building real apps.

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,140
ALEXIS MP: So how would somebody
go about building an app,

101
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,640
pushing it out, and
making it known?

102
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,320
So there's a store for that?

103
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,190
That's how people
find out about it?

104
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,260
JOE MARINI: To build
it, it's really easy.

105
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,780
You can go to our website.

106
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,020
It's developer.chrome.com/apps.

107
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,710
That's where all the information
about the APIs are stored.

108
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,260
If you want to go to Github,
we have a Github repo

109
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,557
at github.com/googlechrome.

110
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:20,140
Then there's a Chrome
app samples repo

111
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,774
in there, shows all the samples.

112
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:23,190
So those are
probably the places I

113
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,832
would start to learn
how to build these.

114
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:26,540
ALEXIS MP: Great.

115
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,650
Francois, how hard was
it to actually build this

116
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,250
once the library was available?

117
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,125
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Once
the library was done?

118
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:32,730
So easy.

119
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,890
And we are hoping to make
this library open source

120
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,555
so that anyone can use it.

121
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:39,930
ALEXIS MP: It's
interesting to be

122
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,720
able &mdash; NFC is obviously
not built in every machine,

123
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,170
but certainly devices
like this one has it.

124
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,610
It'd be great to be able to tap
into that kind of resources.

125
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,690
Any final words on
where to go next?

126
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,878
What you expect from this
technology going forward?

127
00:04:57,878 --> 00:04:59,128
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Oh, dammit.

128
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:02,559

129
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,600
JOE MARINI: We're building
new APIs all the time.

130
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,200
We've already got a lot of great
apps in the Chrome Web Store

131
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,380
that some great
partners have built.

132
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,060
So we're continuing to see
some really good uptake

133
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,247
in the platform among partners.

134
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:17,580
We're looking really forward
to getting these things out

135
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,580
on mobile.

136
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,110
We're really looking forward
to people building mobile apps.

137
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,722
So I think that it's early days.

138
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:25,180
It's just beginning,
and I'm really

139
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,412
excited to see where it goes.

140
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:27,120
ALEXIS MP: Great.

141
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,078
I think I heard good
things about your session,

142
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,300
certainly here at Devoxx.

143
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,920
And people can catch
it soon, and [FRENCH].

144
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,060
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And
if I can add something &mdash;

145
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,500
ALEXIS MP: You should.

146
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,208
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
So, Chrome API, great.

147
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,440
But my hope is that
we'd be destroyed

148
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,800
in a matter of years so that
the web can [INAUDIBLE].

149
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,774
ALEXIS MP: So you're saying
HTML++, 5+, whatever,

150
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:51,440
is the standard.

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,648
JOE MARINI: It would be
great see a lot of this stuff

152
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:55,230
get standardized over time.

153
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,460
ALEXIS MP: But you need
to start somewhere.

154
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,360
JOE MARINI: Got to start
somewhere, exactly.

155
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,070
ALEXIS MP: Chrome
Apps, check it out.

156
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,194
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Woo hoo!

157
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,440
ALEXIS MP: Thank you.

158
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,385
