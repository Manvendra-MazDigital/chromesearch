00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,900
IDO GREEN: Hello, and welcome
to GDL-IL, Google Developer

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,870
Live Israel, and thank
you for joining us.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,760
Today we're going to speak about
startups, and I'm going

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,870
to share a few of the tips and
advices that I have after

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,450
starting six companies so far
in the past 18 years.

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,009
And if you have any questions or
comments, just please feel

8
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,230
free to either pass them on the
chat here or just ask them

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,620
in the end of this Hangout.

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,800
So without further ado, let me
just share with you a few

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,730
slides that I prepared.

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,860
And basically, what we're going
to cover in the next 10,

13
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,320
15 minutes will be some of the
main things that I see more

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,950
and more when I'm working
here with startups.

15
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,970
And for those of you that are in
the Tel Aviv area, I highly

16
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,780
recommend you to check out
campus Tel Aviv, that we are

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,740
basically devoting and helping
startup to bootstrap and to

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,690
leverage the knowledge that we
have here in Google in order

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,790
to bootstrap their initiatives
and to make sure that they are

20
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,000
leveraging and using the
right technologies at

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,580
the starting point.

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,010
So who am I?

23
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,550
My name is Ido Greene,
and I'm Developer

24
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,830
Advocate with Google.

25
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,610
You could reach me out after the
show or any time that you

26
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,690
have any comment or feedback
on one of the products.

27
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,170
We basically acting as Developer
Advocates and not as

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,986
evangelist, because we like to
devote at least 50% of our

29
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:45,560
time to listen to developers &mdash;
it could be

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,700
developers in startups.

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,260
It could be developers in
big organizations &mdash;

32
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,210
and to bring those comments
and feedback back into the

33
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,400
engineering groups.

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,990
I'm mostly focusing on
Chrome HTML5, Chrome

35
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,110
OS, and Cloud platforms.

36
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,860
And if you have any other things
that you would like to

37
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,700
touch on, please feel free to
ping me, and I'll try to

38
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,009
redirect you to the right people
that taking care of the

39
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,470
so many other platforms
and APIs that we

40
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,000
have here in Google.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,690
I'm mostly active these
days on G+.

42
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,230
And you could reach me out at
plus.google.com, and then just

43
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,600
+greenido as one word.

44
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,420
And greenido as one world will
work also on Twitter, and you

45
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,610
could, of course, check
out my blog.

46
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,850
By the way, all the slides of
this show will be in the

47
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,910
footnotes of the Google
Developer Live event, and of

48
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,300
course on my blog.

49
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,800
So first and foremost, when we
are starting a company &mdash; and

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,260
I'm hearing it a lot when
I'm talking with young

51
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,880
entrepreneurs &mdash;

52
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,740
basically, make sure that you
don't thinking about the exit

53
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,870
strategy from the beginning.

54
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,180
If the only thing that is
guiding you is how can I sell

55
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,590
this thing as soon as possible,
you're probably not

56
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,330
going to build it to last, as
Jim Collins said, but you're

57
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,160
going to build it to flop
with a high probability.

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,710
So planning for legacy or
planning to build something

59
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,300
that will last for many years,
much more healthy approach.

60
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,070
And I like this quote from
Mark Cuban, because it

61
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,060
emphasizes exactly what
I said, but in his

62
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,000
own words, of course.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,320
A few things to keep in mind,
and that's basically, I guess,

64
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,200
the first step that each and
every entrepreneur needs to do

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,770
before they're starting to run
on their venture, is to do

66
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,780
research and thorough
research.

67
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,980
Today we have sites like
AngelList and many other, as

68
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,440
like second market and
just Google it.

69
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,690
But try to find if someone
is already answering this

70
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,960
specific pain point that
you recognize.

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,080
And keep in mind that companies
that are active and

72
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,820
basically are doing business in
the market, let's say for

73
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,830
quite nice time in the past, are
quite efficient, because

74
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,600
the ones that aren't efficient
aren't there anymore.

75
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,020
So it's not a healthy point of
view to say something like,

76
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,120
the company that I'm executing
against is just too slow, too

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,610
dumb, too inefficient.

78
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,910
Keep in mind that if the
company's active &mdash;

79
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,430
it might be that some cases,
there are inefficiency in big

80
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,710
organization, and of course you
want to tap and leverage

81
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,780
them, but keep in mind that in
a macro view, most companies

82
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,040
are quite efficient.

83
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,030
Technology is becoming
commodities more to emphasize

84
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,370
that if you are building yet
another app, or you are

85
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,342
launching a feature that is part
of a bigger [INAUDIBLE],

86
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:52,930
like let's say for example, a
startup that will hold all

87
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,630
your photos in the Cloud.

88
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,040
It's just yet another feature
that Facebook, G+, and many

89
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,340
others could and actually
now already doing it.

90
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,470
But let's say that they didn't
provide this specific service.

91
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,220
It's just yet another
feature, and this is

92
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,550
the last point here.

93
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,160
You want to try to avoid it,
because if you already worked

94
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,900
on it for two years and then
this big gorilla, or giant, if

95
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,290
you will, is executing against,
you're basically in

96
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,120
the path of the elephants,
and you don't want

97
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,470
to be in this path.

98
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,060
Aim for the real need.

99
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,540
I see more and more NGOs and VCs
and actually entrepreneurs

100
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,750
as well, they're trying to
emphasize this point of let's

101
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,700
build companies that are built
on real computer science and

102
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,510
not just another hack
here and there.

103
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,010
And I think it's very important,
because in the end

104
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,900
of the day, you do want to
make sure that you are

105
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,070
building something that
will be meaningful.

106
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,970
Let me try here just to make
sure that you see my screen.

107
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,460
And let's, again, try to share
it, because I think I saw that

108
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,520
you lost it.

109
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,020
Hopefully, you're
seeing my slide.

110
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,540
Coffee drinkers get it right.

111
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,260
Actually, I just rephrased what
DHH from 37signals said.

112
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,230
He spoke about drug dealers,
but I like to speak about

113
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,550
coffee drinkers.

114
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,290
And as an addicted coffee
drinker myself, I know exactly

115
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,040
what does it mean.

116
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,820
And here, we're coming to say
something like build an

117
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,680
amazing, great product that
people will be addicted to.

118
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,280
And yeah, you could give free
samples, and you could give

119
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,360
short espresso cups.

120
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,600
But in the end of the day, you
do want to make sure that your

121
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,710
experience, your service is
amazing, and people get

122
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,880
addicted to it, and they are
keep using it on a daily

123
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,230
basis, hopefully even
more than that.

124
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,720
Keep in mind that usually
efficient organizations are

125
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,140
actually delivering and building
themselves in a way

126
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,440
that they will act as efficient
as possible.

127
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,190
And in this case, it's just
coming to show what we learned

128
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,150
in "Freakonomics," that drug
dealers organization are

129
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,310
exactly mimicking what
McDonald's is based on in

130
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,160
terms of the hierarchy and how
managers are delegating

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,450
responsibilities.

132
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,840
And it's true in the startup
early days you don't need to

133
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,360
pay too much attention to it,
because each and every member

134
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,470
is wearing lots of
different hats.

135
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,940
But you do want to put
organization and structure and

136
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,200
objectives and [INAUDIBLE]
results and make sure that

137
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,530
everyone is running through
the same goals.

138
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:41,700
If you are not sure about why
users are dropping you or are

139
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,380
not [INAUDIBLE]

140
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,330
you want, just go to the drawing
boards or try to

141
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,530
improve and iterate quickly
on your product.

142
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,750
And we'll touch about
it a bit later.

143
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,730
Hiring the right people, I think
it's one of the most

144
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,800
problematical challenging
aspects.

145
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,430
You want to make sure that
at least the core team is

146
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,010
composed of people that you
really admire, people that

147
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:13,110
could do lots of things and do
it with a very high quality.

148
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,030
Do everything that you can
yourself in the early days.

149
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,010
It not only will give you more
runway, because you'll be more

150
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,070
efficient and you'll leverage
the cash or any other

151
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,510
resources that you have better,
but because it will

152
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:33,120
force you to hire and start
spending your capitalization

153
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,659
only when you must.

154
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,090
Don't pass on great people.

155
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,520
That's another hard lesson
that I learned myself.

156
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,550
Usually, those people are very
busy, very active, and when

157
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,130
you are lucky enough to meet one
of them, and you see that

158
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:53,640
they and your venture are on the
same page, definitely go

159
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,930
and do whatever you can in
order to put them on

160
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,760
the boat with you.

161
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,060
We know today that CVs and
actually any resume that

162
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,510
candidates will give you
composed for many years of

163
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,700
irrelevance.

164
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,050
And one of the best things here
is not only to make sure

165
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,570
that you are giving some
problems and see how the

166
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,200
candidate is thinking, but just
try to start small, and

167
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,110
in some cases, if the candidate
is already working

168
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,100
as a freelancer, it might be
better just to try before you

169
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,500
hire him for full time.

170
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,280
And that could actually make
expectation and be for the

171
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,060
benefit of both sides.

172
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,230
Empower your team.

173
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,570
I think that it's crucial that
the cofounders and the

174
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,390
management team will know that
they are there just to

175
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,650
delegate and make sure that
they are giving their

176
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:49,060
developers, designers, product
leads, all the [INAUDIBLE]

177
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,430
and capabilities in order
to build what they

178
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,540
think is the best.

179
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,340
And Jim Collins, that I
mentioned before, wrote some

180
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,200
several amazing books that I
highly recommend you to read,

181
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,880
like "Built to Last" and "Good
to Great." And he's describing

182
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,580
a level five leader as
the top level of the

183
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,650
leader it could be.

184
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,030
And you could think of someone
like Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos

185
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:16,110
of Amazon as people that you
want to mimic, but behave, of

186
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,500
course, nicely.

187
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,890
Good is fine.

188
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,440
One of the things that we're
seeing more and more in

189
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,220
startups is the trying to
polish too much things.

190
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,320
And of course, it's always gray,
because you do want to

191
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,160
have this amazing,
magic experience.

192
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,560
But on the other side of this
equation, you do want to focus

193
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,340
on your most valuable
product, service.

194
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,890
And sometimes you just want to
get it out, get the feedback

195
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,063
from your users, and
then iterate and

196
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:45,860
improve it over time.

197
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,530
So the main point here is not
to wait two years down the

198
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,760
road and then put something in
the air and get real knowledge

199
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,890
from your users on what it does
to them, but be agile and

200
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,830
try to take small decisions
that are much better to

201
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,640
encapsulate, and then just
keep iterate on them very

202
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,590
frequently.

203
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,250
I think Google is a great
example for doing exactly

204
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,200
that, even in a large
organization,

205
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,950
not only in a startup.

206
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,350
In a startup, in my last
startup, we actually called

207
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,550
ourself more of a &mdash;

208
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,760
looked at ourself more as a
small car, not a small boat,

209
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,550
but basically you're enjoying
the ability to pivot quickly

210
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,790
and to move quickly.

211
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,180
And that's something that you
really want to grasp and take

212
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,280
it to your own hands an
advantage, because big

213
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,970
organizations are moving
much more slowly.

214
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,820
It's true that when they are
taking the decision and they

215
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,260
are moving, they are the
elephants on the path, and you

216
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,540
don't want to be
on their path.

217
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,880
But at least you could pivot
quickly and avoid them.

218
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,450
So the main point here is to
keep in mind that your money

219
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,650
that you raised and the
resources that you got are

220
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,410
very limited, and you probably
need more than you expect, so

221
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,340
try to be as efficient as
possible and execute as

222
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,220
quickly as possible.

223
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,360
When we're coming to speak about
a business and not a

224
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,140
startup, I think it's just
connecting us to the first

225
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:18,100
point, which is try to avoid
this la-la-land or this

226
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,190
ever-lasting land that some
people are living in.

227
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:27,410
And don't neglect the ability to
monetize or to leverage the

228
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,000
ability to have this other
side of the equation of

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,820
revenue or some kind
of revenue stream.

230
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,300
And I mentioned, of course, that
people that are building

231
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,540
just to exit are basically,
with a high probability,

232
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,790
building to flop.

233
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,190

234
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,010
Beliefs and reality, I
see some of the young

235
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,710
entrepreneurs that are coming
here to the campus, and we're

236
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,560
mentoring them, coming
with sentences like

237
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,080
the first two here.

238
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,240
And in most of the cases, it's
very, very far from reality.

239
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,315
So the only way that you confirm
yourself that you know

240
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:08,110
what your users really want is
after you launch a product,

241
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,050
and you have the metrics,
and you measure them.

242
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,740
And as you all know, you can't
manage what you can't measure,

243
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,430
and you do want to measure
everything and anything in

244
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,880
order to understand deeply
what is making your user

245
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,750
happy, and then iterate over
it and try to make it even

246
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,570
more magical.

247
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,950
Predicting the future or the
far future, of course, you

248
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,860
could see all over that people
fail tremendously in trying to

249
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,410
predict the near future, and
actually the far [INAUDIBLE]

250
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,480
greater [INAUDIBLE].

251
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,400
The progress and measuring
progress, there's lots of

252
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,650
thoughts about [INAUDIBLE]

253
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,640

254
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,670
trying to move us and shifting
us into [INAUDIBLE]

255
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,700
that you can predict better,
set [INAUDIBLE]

256
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,630
in order to accomplish them.

257
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:09,400
And then helping us be the
speedboat that we spoke about

258
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,670
on the last slide and respond
quickly and act quickly.

259
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,810

260
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,950
Focusing, I think, is one of
the most important aspects.

261
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,610
Because you have limited
resources, limited time,

262
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,950
limited money, you want to make
sure that you're focusing

263
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,950
on all the people in
your organization.

264
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,500
And it could be the three
co-founders are just focusing

265
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,480
on the same needle that
we want to move.

266
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,670
Passion, of course, if people
are not passionate, especially

267
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,270
in the core team, if you don't
see the light in their eyes,

268
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:47,340
and they don't put those 140% or
200% of effort and time and

269
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,950
devotion into the startup,
probably it won't be a

270
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,190
successful one.

271
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,970
And execution, execution I
think is one of the most

272
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,540
important aspects to consider.

273
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:03,000
Great ideas are all over, but
what's really differentiates

274
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,970
is the execution and how well
you execute according to your

275
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,830
objective [? and pure ?]
results.

276
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,040
Plan, of course it's a must.

277
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,540
And you do want to plan, and
you do want to set goals

278
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,400
quarterly, yearly, and probably
something above, so

279
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,060
everyone will be clear about
what is the North Star of your

280
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,750
venture, your company, and where
you want to see yourself

281
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,780
on the long run.

282
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,750
But keep attention that
everything is changing,

283
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,400
everything is volatile, and you
do want to be as agile as

284
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,560
possible, because this is one
of the strength capabilities

285
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,990
that you have at
the beginning.

286
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,340
Find good advisors.

287
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,720
Easy to say, really
hard to do.

288
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,060
But when you do find them, pay
attention that you listen and

289
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,100
you are able to gain and
leverage their feedback.

290
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,190
What to do fast?

291
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,860
So we spoke about those
main components.

292
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,340
And I highly recommend you, if
you are in the front end

293
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,480
development arena, and you're
producing interesting

294
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,520
products, services to the web,
the diagram here are coming to

295
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,540
emphasize that we need and are
actually changing today the

296
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,220
ways that we work in the past.

297
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,240
So basically, this diagram is
just showing us that it's a

298
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,590
never ending story.

299
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,240
We keep iterating after we're
working and launching the

300
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,490
first version of something.

301
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,560
And this is the way to make sure
that we are executing as

302
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,070
fast as we can.

303
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,080
What to avoid.

304
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,810
So yeah, if you're not an expert
on bikes, probably you

305
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,190
do want to avoid
this situation.

306
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,825
And in our case, when you're
coming to pitch to angel

307
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:49,730
investors, each and every
sentence here is well &mdash;

308
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,120
how should I put it &mdash;

309
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,040
is very known and

310
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,350
well-preserved from their side.

311
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:01,370
They know to identify it as pure
BS, and you probably want

312
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,490
to avoid them.

313
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,660
So our product will go viral,
because we're doing x or y.

314
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,960
You want to pay attention and
to make sure that you have a

315
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,650
good plan because in most
of the cases, it won't.

316
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,020
No one else is doing,
probably it's a bad

317
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,109
sign and a red flag.

318
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,369
Because if no one doing
it, probably

319
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:22,069
there is a good reason.

320
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,950
Try to think about successful
companies that you know and

321
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,869
amazing ventures that you see.

322
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:31,700
In most of the cases, they did
have some competitors at the

323
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,660
early days.

324
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,130
And there's lots of
examples on that.

325
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,040
Projections are conservative.

326
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,670
Well, you could smile when
you're saying it.

327
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,480
And all the others are also
very, very good points.

328
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,710
And as I mentioned, large
companies might be too small

329
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,920
or too big or too whatever, but
you need to come with real

330
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,570
arguments why it's viable niche
or why you could execute

331
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,510
much better than the current
competitors.

332
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,370
And on the other side of the
equation, for investor, when

333
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,100
you're seeing one of these,
probably a flag should

334
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,530
rise in your eyes.

335
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:18,430
And each and every sentence here
is quite well-known and

336
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,270
quite common, unfortunately.

337
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,270
As you all know, VC or a
typical angel will see

338
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,520
hundreds of startups and
entrepreneurs, and then they

339
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,370
will invest in, I don't
know, a dozen or less.

340
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,190
So the probabilities that you
will be able to raise money

341
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,370
are quite low.

342
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,650
And some of the things here
are quite common.

343
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:47,800
And actually try to just go and
put your efforts and move

344
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,490
on with other investors
or VCs.

345
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,280
Some resources that I highly
recommend you to check out.

346
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,180
If you want to see what the
Google Cloud Platform is

347
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,610
offering entrepreneurs these
days, this is the link on

348
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,985
cloud.google.com.

349
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:07,000
Any other materials that we have
today for startups and

350
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,470
entrepreneurs and developers
are on

351
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,230
developers.google.com/startups.

352
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,940
For the entrepreneurs that want
to launch and start new

353
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,350
businesses, there's an amazing
[INAUDIBLE] series from

354
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,840
Stanford, and it's in
Entrepreneurship Corner.

355
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,870
And it's great, great ability
to listen to thought leaders

356
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,490
and amazing entrepreneurs that
did it and to learn and gain

357
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,130
from their experience.

358
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,750
And some blogs that I personally
really like, AVC,

359
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,660
of course Fred Wilson from
Twitter fame and lots of other

360
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,540
companies like Foursquare of
course, and Paul Graham from Y

361
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,550
Combinator and Ben Feld, all of
them are great, great angel

362
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,120
investors, VC investors, and
of course people that write

363
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,330
extremely well.

364
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,880
If you have any questions,
please feel free.

365
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,430
Right now, it's a great
opportunity.

366
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:13,050
And if not, just ping me on
G+ or through my blog.

367
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,100
Thank you very much, and
until next Wednesday,

368
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,350
be strong and happy.

369
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:27,800
