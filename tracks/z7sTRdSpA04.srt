1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,290

2
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,390
OK.

3
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,890
I want to show you
the new emulation

4
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,110
feature in Chrome DevTools.

5
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,485
And it's great for understanding
how your content's going

6
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:06,860
to look across
different devices.

7
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,901
So I'm going to start here
on the Wikipedia site.

8
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:10,810
And you can see when I
resize the site down,

9
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,350
that it doesn't scale well.

10
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,590
I don't get any sense of
how this site would play out

11
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,680
if I were viewing it on
a phone, for example.

12
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,990
So if I open up DevTools,
and I bring the console using

13
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,140
the Escape key on the
keyboard &mdash; and you can also

14
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,230
use this icon up
here &mdash; you'll see

15
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,142
that there's a new
tab called Emulation.

16
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:27,100
Now there are lots of
really interesting things

17
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,930
inside of here, like screen
resolution, device pixel ratio,

18
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,697
user agent strings, and other
fun stuff like geolocation.

19
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:36,030
Now Emulation is going to let
me set all of these things

20
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,270
individually and have total
control over how Chrome's

21
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,470
going to present itself
to any given site.

22
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,110
But to make life a
little bit easier,

23
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,160
we've also included a
bunch of device presets.

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,635
So I'm going to go ahead
and choose the Nexus 4 here.

25
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:49,260
Now that sets a bunch
of these features

26
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,982
on, which you can see now have
this blue check next to them.

27
00:00:51,982 --> 00:00:53,440
Because the Wikipedia
site actually

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,231
serves different content
to mobile devices,

29
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:57,210
I'm going to need
to refresh the page.

30
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,419
And now you'll see that
we're served the mobile site.

31
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:01,210
Now we've done a bunch
of work to make sure

32
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,700
that the Emulation behaves as
close to reality as possible.

33
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,160
And one of the things
you're going to notice

34
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,014
is that my cursor has
turned into this dot.

35
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:08,430
And that's because
we're emulating

36
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,950
touch, including
proper touch events.

37
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,930
If I hold Shift and
click Drag, you'll

38
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,352
see that I'm also able
to mimic pinch to zoom.

39
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:16,810
This whole experience
is far better

40
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,770
than simply spoofing
the user agent string.

41
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,520
You can really start
to get a sense of how

42
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,230
your project's going to
react for any given device.

43
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,830
I also want to
show you this demo

44
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,130
to give you a bit more
detail on device pixel ratio.

45
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,872
You'll see that my desktop has
a device pixel ratio of one.

46
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:31,580
And if we take a peek
at the source file,

47
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,850
you'll see that
we're using image-set

48
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,440
to choose the most
appropriate image.

49
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,450
Right now, that's the 1x image.

50
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,390
If I turn on Emulation
inside of Dev Tools

51
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,510
and set the device
pixel ratio to 2,

52
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,754
you'll see that we're
now serving the 2x image.

53
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:44,420
This is super useful
when you're looking

54
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,350
to test serving the right assets
based on device pixel ratio,

55
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,640
whether you have access to
a high DPI device or not.

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,866
So that's just a taste of
emulating mobile devices.

57
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:54,990
Please take a look around,
use it in your workflow,

58
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,430
and head to devtools.chrome.com
