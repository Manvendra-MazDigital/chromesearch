MARY GROVE: We have an
audience question.

10
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,380
How does that affect the way
we evaluate potential

11
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,362
investments, especially
at the seed level?

LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to Google
Developers Live at I/O 2013.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,382
I'm Louis Gray, head of GDL.

15
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:38,850
And joining me today is my
co-host Daniel Sieberg.

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,760
DANIEL SIEBERG: Louis, thanks so
much for having me here at

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,960
GDL Live at I/O 2013.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,990
This is actually my second I/O.
And I believe it's your

19
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,470
forth, right?

20
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,440
LOUIS GRAY: It's my fourth I/O.
I went twice as press.

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,290
And it's my second year
here as Googler.

22
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,140
I'm really excited about what
we've got in stage for GDL at

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,710
I/O. We have exclusive
interviews kicking off from

24
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,290
the stage in Moscone really
back-to-back.

25
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,540
Right between every single
session, so not a single

26
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,240
minute is wasted for those of
you on the live-stream.

27
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,710
Really excited about that.

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,110
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
absolutely.

29
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,150
We've got 5500 folks here,
but lots more watching,

30
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,330
wherever you are.

31
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,870
And part of my job will be to,
not only be here with you

32
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,160
chatting on occasion, but to
actually go out and talk to

33
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,720
the developers in the sandboxes,
our partners.

34
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,810
Learn from them about what
they're working on

35
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,750
and bring that here.

36
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,680
We'll see some of that content
today and then some of it

37
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,610
tomorrow as well.

38
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,350
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely,
I'm looking forward

39
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,100
that a great deal.

40
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,920
You're going to talk with
partners from Google+, Drive,

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,290
Maps, and YouTube.

42
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,950
And while you're away doing the
hard work, I'm going to be

43
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,590
back here, holding
down the fort.

44
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,940
We're going to be talking with
Megan Smith of Google X to

45
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,820
talk about moonshots.

46
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,780
We'll be talking to people on
Blink, Performance Alley,

47
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,190
Ingress, and some really hot
topics that everybody wants to

48
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,590
know about.

49
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,050
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

50
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,730
Fantastic keynote, of course,
to a kick all of this off.

51
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,570
We've got a lot of work to do.

52
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,820
We've got an amazing lineup.

53
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,130
I feel like I should go roll
up my sleeves and get at it

54
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:45,540
here, right?

55
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,150
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

56
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,830
So I definitely appreciate
you joining me.

57
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,360

stream, we definitely want you

58
