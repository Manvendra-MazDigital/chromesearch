1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,600
ARDAN ARAC: OK.

3
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,130
Well, welcome to our session.

4
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,660
We're very excited to
have you here today.

5
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,620
And I know it's late in the
afternoon, so you're probably

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,520
pretty tired.

7
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,990
But we have some truly exciting
stuff to show you.

8
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,840
Today, we're going to show you
how you can transform your

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,900
brand queries on
Google search.

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,190
JOHN HJELMSTAD: And we're going
to do that through the

11
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,580
power of the Google+ API,
Google+ pages, as well as the

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,860
Google+ Sign-In API and
related technologies.

13
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,420
ARDAN ARAC: I'm Ardan from
the search team.

14
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,860
I'm a product manager.

15
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,310
And in the first half of the
talk, I'll be walking you

16
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,005
through the user experience,
and what is possible.

17
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:35,960
JOHN HJELMSTAD: And I'm John.

18
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,140
I'm an engineer on Google+.

19
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,970
And I'm going to, in the second
half of the talk, tell

20
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,320
you how you can actually
implement this, and in fact,

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,690
get your part of the equation
rolling today, in as little as

22
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,770
half an hour, to provide
this integration.

23
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,130
ARDAN ARAC: Today, we'll be
mostly talking about a class

24
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,640
of queries that I call
brand queries.

25
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,080
These are queries like
Audi, NBC, Fandango--

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,900
people coming to Google and
searching directly for you.

27
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,550
So the first question
to address is,

28
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,610
why should you care?

29
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,200
People are already
looking for you.

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,990
Who cares what the Google
results page looks like?

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,930
Well, for many of your users,
current and prospective,

32
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,870
Google is the first interaction

33
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,610
point for your brand.

34
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,370
On the internet, it's not really
your home page where

35
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,990
you make the first impression.

36
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,230
It's the Google search
results page.

37
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,510
And this is what the page looks
like for a lot of you.

38
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,300
And this is a very great page.

39
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,650
It's very useful, gets
the job done.

40
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,990
But today, we'll show you
how you can get to this.

41
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,230
The first thing that strikes me
when I look at this is how

42
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,810
much more beautiful it
is, more visual.

43
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,900
The logo is there.

44
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,630
The movie posters are there.

45
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,570
Before, and after--

46
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,800
but it's not just pretty
for prettiness' sake.

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,150
It's also very useful.

48
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,950
At Google, we're all about
relevance and bringing useful

49
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,350
content to the users.

50
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,530
So let's think about
the use case here.

51
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,120
I come to Google searching
for Fandango.

52
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,710
On the right hand side, I see
the most popular movies that

53
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,350
are trending on Fandango across
their website or mobile

54
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,420
app right now.

55
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,140
So the fact that "Oblivion" is
the top movie, it's pretty

56
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,860
likely that I too am interested
in "Oblivion," or

57
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,980
one of those four movies
we're showcasing here.

58
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,840
So my eye goes there.

59
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,160
My mouse goes there, and I
click on it, and here.

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,840
I'm on "Oblivion"'s page on
Fandango, ready to complete my

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,240
transaction.

62
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,780
It is so much faster.

63
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,280
And if beauty and efficiency and
relevance don't convince

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,620
you, perhaps math will.

65
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,150
Here, you doubled your footprint
on Google's search

66
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,470
results page.

67
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,470
You doubled the number of
links pointing to your

68
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,150
website, and you supplemented
the page with even more

69
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,220
relevant links relevant now.

70
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,100

71
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,040
Here's another example.

72
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,090
Let's say I heard about TuneIn
last night from John.

73
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,295
He mentioned he uses it.

74
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:05,300
He loves it.

75
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,730
I barely remember what it was or
why he liked it, so I come

76
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,030
and Google it.

77
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,980
This is what I would
see today, but this

78
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,290
is also what's possible.

79
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,740
The first thing, the
logo is there.

80
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,830
So maybe it rings a bell.

81
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,150
Maybe I remember seeing
TuneIn elsewhere.

82
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,460
If not that, underneath
it, I see CNN's logo.

83
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,960
I see BBC radio.

84
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,930
I immediately you start to
understand TuneIn is where

85
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,460
people go and listen to
these radio stations.

86
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,690
6,000 people seem to be
listening to CNN.

87
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,910
As in the example of Fandango,
if I click on one of these

88
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,950
links, I'm on the right page,
ready to consume the content.

89
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,250
There's also another point
I want to make here.

90
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,250
Everything you see in this
card comes from TuneIn.

91
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,880
It is specified by TuneIn.

92
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,500
So basically, since the clicks
go to TuneIn, we want to give

93
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,850
as accurate a representation of
those pages that we'll be

94
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,100
taking the user to
as possible here.

95
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,950
So the logos, the text, the
descriptions, all come from

96
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,580
schema.org markups.

97
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,440
And John will be getting
into the weeds later.

98
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,710

99
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,260
Let's take a closer look.

100
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,880
So we talked about the logo that
comes from the Google+

101
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,240
profile page.

102
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,140
But there's also the follow
button that allows the users

103
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,760
to follow your brand directly
from search.

104
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,459
And why does that matter?

105
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,110
First of all, you're building
a relationship.

106
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,270
You're building a community.

107
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,670
So from this point on, any post
that you post on your

108
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,660
Google+ profile will appear
in that user's stream.

109
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,860
But there's also another
point here.

110
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,900
As a search team, we now know
that this user cares about

111
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,325
your brand.

112
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:41,580
There is an explicit signal
that they gave us

113
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,100
by following you.

114
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,030
So that goes way deeper than
just the brand query.

115
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,860
Having that kind of an explicit
signal, explicit

116
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,550
affirmation from the user that
they like you, that's the type

117
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,480
of thing we love and integrate
into search.

118
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,360
So building a follower base
is a general good to have.

119
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,230
That pays many dividends
down the stream.

120
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,860

121
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,910
We didn't talk about recent
posts, so I want to spend a

122
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,840
little bit of time
on this one.

123
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,410
So this is the voice of your
brand coming from your Google+

124
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,790
page in realtime on
search results.

125
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,480
So when would that be useful?

126
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,290
How about product launches
or product announcements?

127
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,770
We all work towards these big
milestones where we announce

128
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,000
something and we want everyone
to hear about it.

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,590
So in this case, BMW, who has
launched a new customization

130
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,590
tool for their interior design,
puts a post about that

131
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,020
launch, about that announcement,
right on Google.

132
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,970
And perhaps the reason someone
is searching for BMW on that

133
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,840
particular day is because they
heard about this through a

134
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,080
different channel.

135
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,160
And there's that nice blue link,
and clicking on it goes

136
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,540
to this nice album posted
on Google+.

137
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,740

138
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,200
However, all links don't
need to go to Google+.

139
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,730
That's not the point.

140
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,000
For some announcements, maybe
the appropriate link is to the

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,750
page on your website.

142
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,600
So here, with Verizon's
announcement, the link doesn't

143
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,420
go to Google+.

144
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,830
For BMW, that made sense.

145
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,020
They wanted that visual
experience.

146
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,910
But for Verizon, they want to
maybe sell the product.

147
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,305
So they included a link
to their product page.

148
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:18,450
Examples are really endless, but
I want to walk you through

149
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,950
a couple others.

150
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,380
So you can also use this
to upload all kinds of

151
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,570
interesting, relevant, timely
information, such as events

152
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,790
that you're hosting.

153
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,920
You can also use it to post
realtime updates from the

154
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,440
events themselves.

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,620
Or perhaps promotions, coupons,
daily deals--

156
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,960
but here's another one that
I really like, and this

157
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,090
emphasizes the realtime nature
of this integration.

158
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,750
So every once in a while,
something unexpected happens,

159
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,840
and that you want to deal with--
like, say something

160
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,630
about, with urgency.

161
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,740
In this example, perhaps
something happened in your

162
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,740
local community, and you want to
get your message across as

163
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,220
quickly as possible.

164
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,480
Well, this is a great
distribution system.

165
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,470
You can--

166
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,920
as the CEO of the company, or
the PR person, marketing

167
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,010
person, whoever--

168
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,530
type up a post from your mobile
phone, hit send, and

169
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,830
within less than a minute, that
message is going to be on

170
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,460
Google's search results page
for people looking for you.

171
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,270
And here, maybe you make direct
eye contact with the

172
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,340
user who's searching for
you with your written

173
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,480
message next to it.

174
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,660
And not everything has to
have a time component.

175
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,110
All the examples I walk through
were about events,

176
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,160
promotions, et cetera.

177
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,600
But sometimes, you just want
to show the best of their

178
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,850
pages, best of your content,
with pretty pictures, on

179
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,100
search results page.

180
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,680

181
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,380
And this is the last section
I want to talk about.

182
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,650
I already alluded to it at
the beginning of my talk.

183
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,610
We are just beginning to release
this new module that

184
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,390
shows people who are looking
for you, what is popular,

185
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,650
what's trending on
your site or app.

186
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,200
Well, how do we know
what's popular?

187
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,340
Google+ platform team released
Sign-In with Google

188
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,050
functionality that I hope all
of you are considering or

189
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,790
adopting to your website
and mobile app.

190
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,790
So users come and login with
their Google ID to your

191
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,780
service, be it on mobile
or desktop.

192
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,160
Then with their consent, you
can send us the activities

193
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,180
that those users are
engaged in--

194
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,220
the songs that are being
listened or the movies that

195
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,800
are being purchased.

196
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,130
So then, one of the first
integration points of this

197
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,860
data into Google search is
what I'm showing here.

198
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,309
We aggregate all those
activities, find out what is

199
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,750
trending right now, and then
put links into them with

200
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,630
accurate descriptions coming
from your web pages into these

201
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,120
right hand side cards.

202
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,410
So Google+ Sign-In is--

203
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,840
basically, we will be having a
lot more integrations on top

204
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,620
of Google+ Sign-In, and this is
the first starting point.

205
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,370
So with that, I hand over to
John, who will be talking you

206
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,620
through how to get to
these features.

207
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,040
JOHN HJELMSTAD: That's right.

208
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,760
Thank you, Ardan.

209
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,790
So this is a really exciting
opportunity to actually have

210
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,870
the ability to have your voice,
as well as the voice of

211
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,550
your users, on your Google
search results page for your

212
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,640
brand query.

213
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,160
And that's almost
unprecedented.

214
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,620
In fact, actually, it
is unprecedented.

215
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,460
And you might think
to yourself, how

216
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,390
can I make this happen?

217
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,120
And the great news is that
it's incredibly easy.

218
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,210
I'm going to describe today
two different levels of

219
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,220
integration that you can do.

220
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,430
One is so simple that within
the span of half an hour's

221
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,430
worth of time today while
sitting in Google I/O, you can

222
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,250
get your portion of this ball
rolling to activate the right

223
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,840
hand search box to begin with.

224
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,520
All that involves is having an
activated +Page that also has

225
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,930
current posts that have been
posted quite recently on it.

226
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,460
The second level of integration
that I'm going to

227
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,940
describe is integrating
Google+ Sign-In.

228
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,700
Google+ Sign-In, in turn, as
Ardan mentioned, allows you to

229
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,910
send activities with the user's
consent to Google,

230
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,680
which we in turn can pass back
to you in the form of

231
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,830
promotion in the right hand
search box on the popular

232
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,950
Google+ box.

233
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,620
Let's get into the details.

234
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,210
First level of integration is
what I call basic integration.

235
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,760
All you need to do to activate
the right hand search box is

236
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,100
to have a Google+ that you've
created that claims a website

237
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,255
that corresponds to your
Google+ brand query--

238
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,460
excuse me, your Google
brand query.

239
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,990
And then that page in turn will
have validation code on

240
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,620
at that points back to your
+Page to ensure that the +Page

241
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,170
is yours and you
are the +Page.

242
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,500
The second level of
integration is

243
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,310
to integrate Google+.

244
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,030
You integrate Google+ to tell us
who is doing activities on

245
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,690
your site, what those activities
are, and then with

246
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,430
the help of schema.org, you'll
be able to tell Google's

247
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,370
search engine more about the
page, such that we can render

248
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,930
something relevant and
contextual for the user.

249
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,380
So let's dive right on in.

250
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,070
First thing to do is
to set up a +Page.

251
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,360
Many people here have probably
already done so, but if you

252
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,140
haven't, it's incredibly
simple.

253
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,540
You simply just go to Home,
Pages, Add a Page, and you'll

254
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,710
go through a very easy
to follow flow.

255
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,830
And I'll walk through some of
the most relevant fields

256
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,610
associated with that.

257
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,040
There's quite a few others,
many of them quite

258
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,840
self-explanatory.

259
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,650
So in this case, we're talking
about a product or a brand in

260
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,980
terms of classification.

261
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,680
And you'll give your product
a brand type.

262
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,500
The two fields that are
most relevant are the

263
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,560
most obvious ones.

264
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,470
One is your name--

265
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,670
pretty straightforward.

266
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,810
That name will show up directly,
prominently, and in

267
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,930
large text in the right hand
search box on the top.

268
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,280
The second is your website.

269
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,010
The website is what
you were claiming

270
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,320
corresponds to that +Page--

271
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,560
pretty straightforward.

272
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,590
For best results for that +Page,
execute your brand

273
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,380
query directly yourself, and
simply just copy and paste.

274
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,750
Make sure that there's a
one-to-one correspondence.

275
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,140
It might not necessarily be
absolutely required, but to

276
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,440
make things easy, just
copy the URL directly

277
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,480
into the claim box.

278
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,600
That's fairly simple.

279
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,130
The last stage, which I don't
show on this slide, is simply

280
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,830
just to have your
profile image.

281
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,490
The profile image is what
shows up in the top left

282
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,740
portion of the right
hand search box.

283
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,080
So that's great.

284
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,520
At this point, you
have a +Page.

285
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,000
You've claimed the page
that corresponds

286
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,090
to your brand query.

287
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,710
That's not quite enough, because
of course, anybody

288
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,790
could do that.

289
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,760
The last thing you need to do
is add code your page itself

290
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,000
that validates that that
page is yours.

291
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,640
Now there's a number of
different ways to do this, and

292
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,535
previous talks actually today,
including Paul Linner and

293
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:34,340
Chris [? Macinez, ?]

294
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,970
having to do with our new
Badges, provide some

295
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,050
techniques to do that.

296
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,480
The first technique that I'm
going to describe is to add a

297
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,750
widget to your page.

298
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,760
And the widget could either be
a Brand Badge, which we see

299
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,080
here on the right, or a Follow
button, which you also see

300
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,620
here on the right.

301
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,940
The Brand Badge is a
beautiful, small

302
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,280
representation of your +Page
that you can embed

303
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,400
anywhere on your site.

304
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,090
But if it happens to be on your
home page, Google search

305
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,820
crawler will see this
and take that as

306
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,870
validation of the page itself.

307
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,520
The same is true for
the Follow button.

308
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,670
The Follow button is a lighter
weight version of this.

309
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,890
You'll notice that Follow
exists in the

310
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,490
Brand Badge as well.

311
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,930
And Follow provides yet another
way that you can embed

312
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,690
anywhere in your site, but in
particular, on your claimed

313
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,090
page, to indicate that the +Page
is yours, and to allow

314
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,050
users the ability
to establish a

315
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,240
relationship with you by following.

316
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,080
And then finally, if none of
these work for your particular

317
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,990
UX reasons or others, you can
simply just add a link tag,

318
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,570
which has no UX associated
with it whatsoever, or a

319
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,570
direct link to your +Page.

320
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,580
Once Google search crawlers
crawl your page, they will see

321
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,830
this and take this as
validation, at which point

322
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,850
you're pretty much done.

323
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,600
How do you know that
this has happened?

324
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,960
You go back to your +Page, and
then take note of the URL here

325
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,910
for TuneIn.

326
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,260
If there's a small check boxes
just to the right of it,

327
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,830
Google's crawlers have
found, crawled, and

328
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,330
validated your page.

329
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,870
At this point, you're completely
done, and you can

330
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,890
activate the right hand
search box simply by

331
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,140
adding Activated Posts--

332
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,350
excuse me, Active Posts, which
is the last stage in the basic

333
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,290
integration--

334
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,150
very simple.

335
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,300
It's the same as posting a share
or a post your personal

336
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,510
stream, only, of course, it
corresponds to your +Page.

337
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,190
Now, there are two requirements
associated with

338
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,200
posts that are required
to trigger the

339
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,470
right hand search box.

340
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,360
The absolute requirement is
that you have some text.

341
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,630
We need to provide additional
information in context.

342
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,600
But of course, it is strongly
recommend as well to either

343
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,680
have a link or an image.

344
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,890
The image will be displayed
directly on the page,

345
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,620
providing that it can
be, of course.

346
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,080
And then if you provide a link,
Google's crawlers will

347
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,720
crawl that link, find an image
from it, and display that as

348
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,250
well in the right hand side.

349
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,220
And here we have a couple
of examples.

350
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,790
TuneIn is promoting a Deadmau5
concert with a link.

351
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,420
That link was crawled on
TuneIn's website, and the

352
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,410
image appeared accordingly.

353
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,920
In the second particular
example, an image was provided

354
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,540
directly, which corresponds
to the text.

355
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,780

356
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,240
And that's pretty much it.

357
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,270
It's incredibly simple.

358
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,050
And like I said, your portion
of this can be done in as

359
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,220
little as 15, 30 minutes today,
simply by starting up

360
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,550
your +Page, claiming it, and
then providing validation.

361
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,170
Google search crawlers
will do the rest.

362
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,120
So before and after is an
incredibly powerful

363
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,110
demonstration of this technique
and this technology.

364
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,960
So from here, I'm going to
talk about the deeper

365
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,470
integration.

366
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,960
And this is something that, as
Ardan mentioned, is already

367
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,820
paying dividends, but is
becoming more and more

368
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,190
powerful as we continue to add
features of the Google+

369
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,440
Sign-In platform.

370
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,180
And this involves integrating
Google+ Sign-In, and then

371
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,220
sending app activities with
users' consent to Google,

372
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,260
indicating activity that is
going on on your site.

373
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,120
Now, thinking about this in a
very straightforward fashion,

374
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,730
if you look at the Popular on
Google+ side, we need to know

375
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,850
how many users are doing
something, and what they're

376
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,580
doing, and then to be able
to represent that.

377
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,660
Corresponds to three concepts.

378
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,290
First of all, who's
on your site?

379
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:12,390
This is conferred by adding
Google+ Sign-In to your site.

380
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,360
Second, sending app
activities--

381
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,200
what is the user doing,
and on what page--

382
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,380
which is represented as a URL,
which we'll see in details--

383
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,000
does that activity apply?

384
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,030
And then third, Google's
crawlers

385
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,270
will crawl those URLs.

386
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,340
And you can provide a way using
schema.org to tell us

387
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,580
how to best render that content,
so that when the user

388
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,380
sees it in Popular on Google+,
will get an accurate

389
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,750
representation of where
they're about to go.

390
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,790
Let's dive into the details.

391
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,220
First thing to do is to
integrate Google+ Sign-In.

392
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,170
Now, there are a number of
different talks in Google I/O

393
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,180
today that will give you
a lot of the details .

394
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,170
And it's important to recognize
that you can do this

395
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,850
for web, Android, or I/O.
Everything that applies to

396
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,050
this talk has to do it either
web- or app-related

397
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,450
activities.

398
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,570
For the purposes of the
discussion today, I'm going to

399
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,190
go through the web flow just
as an example, just to show

400
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,220
you how simple it will be.

401
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,000
However, there are a number of
different talks, all of which

402
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,630
are tomorrow--

403
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,460
a deep dive into integration on
web, Android, and iOS-- and

404
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,666
I strongly encourage you to
check out any of them if they

405
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,640
are of interest to you.

406
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,630
So the first thing to do in
integrating to a Google+

407
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,140
Sign-In into a webpage
is to add the

408
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,859
Google+ JavaScript snippet.

409
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,490
And this activates all APIs
that Google+ supports.

410
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,220
This includes +1, Brand
Badge, Follow widget.

411
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,000
It also allows you access to the
Google+ Client, with which

412
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,920
you can send activities
to Google.

413
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,250
It's a pretty straightforward
piece of boilerplate that you

414
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,000
more or less just copy
and paste once

415
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,380
onto any given page.

416
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,500
And then from there, what you
would like to do is add a

417
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,780
Google+ Sign-In widget.

418
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,070
The widget is activated, as
all other widgets on the

419
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,420
Google+ platform are, with a
small snippet of HTML5 markup.

420
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,060
This provides an example
of the Sign-In widget.

421
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,160
As you'll notice, it's
simply just a span

422
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,250
which has a class g-signin.

423
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,960
All widgets have class equals
g dash something.

424
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,740
And in this case, it's
a Sign-In widget.

425
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,620
I'll go through a couple of the
other parameters that are

426
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,930
relevant to this integration,
as well as all integrations

427
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,260
that have to do with Sign-In,
just to give you a little more

428
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,450
flavor for the important factors
that are involved in

429
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,600
integration.

430
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,990
And the first one is the
callback parameter.

431
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,310
In the case of web, when a user
goes through a Sign-In

432
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,140
flow, a JavaScript function
is executed with the

433
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,460
result of that flow.

434
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,100
And what you need to know
is simply one thing.

435
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,180
Was it successful?

436
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,930
And if it was successful, at
that point, you can start

437
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,960
sending app activities
back to Google.

438
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,490
Let's take a look at
what the JavaScript

439
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,180
function will look like.

440
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,150
This is very simple.

441
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,810
And of course, we can
go into more detail.

442
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,650
I recommend that you go to the
web talk tomorrow, or watch it

443
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,320
on stream if you'd like.

444
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,530
Here, we're defining
a function called

445
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,440
handleAuthResult.

446
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,350
It takes in a result object.

447
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,880
For the purposes of the
function, it simply just looks

448
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,670
like a standard object.

449
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,400
And it either has as
one of two fields.

450
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,520
Access token--

451
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,820
if that token exists, the flow
was executed successfully, and

452
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,920
you can start making requests,
which we indicate here via

453
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,960
simple Boolean.

454
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,540
There's a number of
ways to do that.

455
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,630
If there's an error, you can log
it, and there's a number

456
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,560
of different other things that
you can do, which you can hear

457
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,990
about tomorrow.

458
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,360
Second field is Client ID.

459
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,340
Your application or site needs
to be able to identify itself

460
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,590
to Google uniquely so that
we know what app or site

461
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,590
corresponds to the activities.

462
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,100
And that's done through the
use of a Client ID.

463
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,090
You can set up your Client ID
at cloud.google.com/console,

464
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,620
and then click Register App.

465
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,530
You'll go through a flow, of
which I've shown a couple of

466
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,850
details here, that allows you
to select the type of app or

467
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,180
site that you're talking about,
and then add certain

468
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,860
metadata associated with it.

469
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,190
In the case of a web
application, all you need to

470
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,530
do is indicate that it is a web
application, and then copy

471
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,010
and paste in all the host
origins on which

472
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,150
your script may exist.

473
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,500
Between the two of these,
Google's APIs will be able to

474
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,180
validate that the client ID is
legitimate, and then therefore

475
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,570
know who your app is
and who you are.

476
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,950
Finally, I'll talk about this
requestvisibleactions field

477
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,260
just to call out again that all
these activities that you

478
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,170
post on behalf of your users are
done with their consent.

479
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,720
When you pass
requestvisibleactions equals

480
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,030
this value to Google, what it
does is triggers the consent

481
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,100
dialogue to ask the user, is
it all right for us to send

482
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,010
activities on your behalf?

483
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,320
Supposing they consent, your
JavaScript callback will get

484
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,220
an access token.

485
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,306
And from there you can start
sending activities.

486
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,820
So finally, let's talk about
what it looks like to actually

487
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,760
send those activities.

488
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,410
And this is also very simple,
so simple that the amount of

489
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,530
JavaScript necessary can
fit on one slide with

490
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,160
fairly large text.

491
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,750
There are two pieces associated
with this.

492
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,110
One, there's a simple "if"
conditional that says, was the

493
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,800
sign-in flow successful
to begin with?

494
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,480
And there's a number of
different pieces of logic you

495
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,780
can put in there, depending
on your integration.

496
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,860
But most importantly,
you create a moment.

497
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,140
The Google Moments API allows
you to send different types of

498
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,930
what we call moments-- in this
particular case, an activity--

499
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,880
to Google.

500
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,340
There are only two pieces of
data associated with an

501
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,460
activity that are absolutely
required-- one, the type.

502
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,520
There are a number of
different types.

503
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,062
In this particular example,
I'm saying the user has

504
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:24,570
listened to something,
and that something is

505
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,060
identified by a URL.

506
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,540
And that's all it is.

507
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,330
From there, you use the Google
Client, which already has the

508
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,290
access token which has been
granted by the user going

509
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,130
through the consent
flow to it.

510
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,810
And you simply just post this to
the moments vault, which is

511
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,770
the URL for the moments API.

512
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,710
From there, Google knows that
the activity has occurred, and

513
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,930
you're pretty much done.

514
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,680
The result of this can
be used as well, for

515
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,750
logging and other purposes.

516
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,370
But for the purposes of Popular
on Google+, that is

517
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,350
all you need to do.

518
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,920
So at this point, if we go back
to the Popular on Google+

519
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,150
section, let's think about it.

520
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,060
What do we know how to do?

521
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,680
We know who's doing what on
your site, and to what.

522
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,370
So we can display the account,
basically by

523
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,290
uniquifying the URLs.

524
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,750
And we know that that
number of users has

525
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,900
performed that activity.

526
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,120
The last piece of data that we
need is data about what that

527
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,920
URL actually corresponds to.

528
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,680
And the way that we do that is
by requesting that sites add

529
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,430
schema.org markup
to their page.

530
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,880
Now, schema.org is an open
standard that simply just

531
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,350
involves adding additional
attributes to existing HTML to

532
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,790
tell us more about what it is,
semantically speaking.

533
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,420
Now, Google is really good at
inferring meaning from HTML.

534
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,470
But at the same time, schema.org
allows you to

535
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,790
specifically indicate what
that content is.

536
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,920
Is it a song?

537
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,220
What is its duration?

538
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,770
What language are we
talking about?

539
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,650
It basically takes the guesswork
out, and really

540
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,840
makes it much more
deterministic.

541
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,860
And it's an incredibly
powerful technique.

542
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,190
But I will start by talking
about a simple example here,

543
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,040
corresponding to a song.

544
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,360
Now, take a look
at this markup.

545
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,680
It's very simple.

546
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,590
Obviously, it would be more
complex, in all likelihood, on

547
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,010
a real site, but it really
gets the point across.

548
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,480
This represents a displayed
representation of a song.

549
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,930
You can see there's an image.

550
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:24,390
There's the BBC Radio 93.5 is
the name associated with it.

551
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,250
There's genre information.

552
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,367
But is all this kind of in
a mishmash of divs and

553
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,520
spans and all this.

554
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,760
There's a listen control
at the bottom.

555
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,620
It's actually kind of ironic
that most, or at least many

556
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,010
websites, are generated from
structured content, and

557
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,722
completely lose it
on the way out.

558
00:23:38,722 --> 00:23:44,420
Schema.org allows you to put
those semantics back in.

559
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,110
So how do you do this?

560
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,720
The first thing you do is by
circumscribing the universe of

561
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,080
discourse that you're talking
about, simply just by adding

562
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,840
the itemscope property to
the top-level div that

563
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,200
encapsulates all the information
about this song.

564
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,540
Itemscope basically just
says, this is a thing.

565
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,510
The next attribute you add
is itemtype, which says

566
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,180
what type it is.

567
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:09,150
The types are all enumerated at
schema.org/docs/full.html.

568
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,450
In this particular case,
we're talking

569
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,710
about a music recording.

570
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:14,410
Now within the type of music
recording, a lot of additional

571
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,630
attributes can apply, that
map very directly to this

572
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,850
particular DOM.

573
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,970
All of these are marked via
itemprop attributes.

574
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,490
So you just add itemprop
to the DOM accordingly.

575
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,520
You'll notice that we've marked
where there's an image,

576
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,330
what the name of the music
recording is in this

577
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,500
particular case, the
genre, and the

578
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,870
language which it occurs.

579
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,400
There may be a bunch of
additional data on the page.

580
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,800
Now, that's fairly
straightforward.

581
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,010
When Google's crawlers get to
this content, it allows us to

582
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,080
pull all these fields out,
sanitize them appropriately,

583
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,260
and render them directly and
meaningfully in the Popular on

584
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,470
Google+ box.

585
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,580
It's an incredibly powerful
technique, and something that

586
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,325
extends well beyond the Popular
on Google+ box.

587
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:59,670
So I suggest that you take a
look at schema.org if you have

588
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,010
any interest in it, because this
is the sort of thing that

589
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,260
will continue to pay dividends
over time.

590
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,877
Today, Popular on Google+
supports two different types

591
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:13,370
of schema.org markup,
corresponding to a number of

592
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,200
different types of activity
to which that could occur.

593
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,550
This is in the music and
movies verticals.

594
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,370
So for music, the schema.org
type is music

595
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,320
recording, as you see.

596
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,740
You can listen, discover, or buy
that, or at least indicate

597
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,010
that your users are doing so.

598
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,030
And for movies, discover, buy,
want, and review are the

599
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,480
applicable activities.

600
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,330
But of course, the team is
working extremely hard to

601
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:39,450
expand the types of entities
that are understood, as well

602
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,570
as being able to represent of
those entities in a much more

603
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,740
fluid way, in a much more
meaningful way.

604
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,590
Popular on Google+ is really
only the beginning of this

605
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,440
integration.

606
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,740
ARDAN ARAC: Thanks, John.

607
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,800
I'll say the closing words.

608
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,140
So basically, we showed you
today how you can really jazz

609
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,230
up your brand queries.

610
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,680
But as the search team and the
social team and with this

611
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,680
partnership, our goal is to go
way, way beyond brand queries.

612
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,080
And the better we understand
your app, your site,

613
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,190
individuals' relationship to
you, either through the Follow

614
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,510
action or the user activities
that you're writing to us, the

615
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,010
better we understand the
content and how it is

616
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,320
consumed, the better we
can represent you.

617
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,760
This gives us a new
understanding of how what

618
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,090
users are doing, how they're
consuming, which

619
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,240
user cares about you.

620
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,920
All this stuff is just a wealth
of information that

621
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,550
will keep enriching the
search experience.

622
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,560
And we started with brand
queries, and I hope this talk

623
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,910
and the examples and showed you
were exciting enough for

624
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,760
you to go and put that half an
hour of work in to activate

625
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,270
your Google+ page, or one week
of one engineer's work to

626
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,500
integrate Google Sign-In, but
there's a lot more to come.

627
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,870
So thank you.

628
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,800
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Thank
you very much.

629
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,930
[APPLAUSE]

630
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,890
JOHN HJELMSTAD: So we've
got plenty of time.

631
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,175
If you would like, we are open
to the mic for questions.

632
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:12,370

633
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:18,130
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious
how current search engine

634
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,560
placement and whatnot for
our old search engine

635
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,130
optimization, how that
comes into play here.

636
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,820
Does it improve?

637
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,733
Does it even come into
play at all?

638
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:32,620
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Ardan?

639
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,280
ARDAN ARAC: So basically, we
have, at least with all the

640
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,760
features we showed you today,
we haven't really changed

641
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,050
anything in the central column
in terms of ranking.

642
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,550
It's all on the right
hand side.

643
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,410

644
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,770
AUDIENCE: So regarding the
ranking on the search results,

645
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,140
the first result is what's going
to determine the card on

646
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,390
the right, correct?

647
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:53,830
JOHN HJELMSTAD: That's right.

648
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:58,060
AUDIENCE: Is it possible for a
single Google+ page, so let's

649
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,640
say TMZ for example, to trigger
on TMZ, a search for

650
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,910
that, and also for
celebrity news?

651
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,910
Does it matter, as long as
they're the number one ranking

652
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,900
for that term?

653
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,000
ARDAN ARAC: No, not
at the moment.

654
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,150
So basically, because there are,
of course, other sites--

655
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,740
like Paris Hilton also is
in celebrity news--

656
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,840
at least at this point, we
don't choose which +Page

657
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,890
applies to a more
generic query.

658
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,090
So the feature currently
is pretty tightly

659
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,310
tied to brand queries.

660
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,940
AUDIENCE: So have to
specifically have a search for

661
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,130
your brand name for
that to appear.

662
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,069
ARDAN ARAC: Yes.

663
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:34,319
AUDIENCE: OK.

664
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,060

665
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

666
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,770
Can you hear me?

667
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,790
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Yep.

668
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,030
AUDIENCE: You talked about
+Page, but there's a lot of

669
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,270
talk on the web, like, for local
pages, business pages.

670
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,270
Are we talking about
the same thing?

671
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,710
Because lately, you've being
mentioning all these different

672
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,150
definitions of pages.

673
00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:00,470
So is it +Page, local pages, or
are there different things?

674
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,550
JOHN HJELMSTAD: For the purposes
of this integration,

675
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,470
we're just talking
about +Pages.

676
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,080
There may be additional features
that we add similar

677
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,480
to this that are inspired by its
hope for success, but for

678
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,270
right now, we're just talking
about +Pages.

679
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,060
AUDIENCE: Like for the
Google local pages

680
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,590
from Maps or something?

681
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,500
Or local businesses,
I mean, there--

682
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,770
ARDAN ARAC: Those are
also hosted on

683
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,830
Google+, as far as I know.

684
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,750
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Yeah, so that's
just a different type

685
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,070
of page associated with this.

686
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,450
But for now, we're really just
talking about brand queries,

687
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,260
so corresponds to product
or brand searches.

688
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:30,440
ARDAN ARAC: But there is an

689
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,940
internationalization component.

690
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,480
That brings me to
a good point.

691
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,250
So for example, in the case of
Starbucks, there can be a

692
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,120
global Starbucks page,
like in English.

693
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,390
So that is the content that
would show in most cases, at

694
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,660
least for queries in English.

695
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,880
But then maybe Starbucks Japan
chose to also have an identity

696
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,130
and a page where they post
Japanese content.

697
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,270
So we definitely look
at the localization.

698
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,400
So for query Starbucks in Japan,
the content would come

699
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,310
from their Japan page.

700
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,070
And for the query in English,
it would come from their

701
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,790
English page, or the page
associated with the US.

702
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:08,560
And things can get even more
localized for local

703
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,540
businesses, to like state,
city levels.

704
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,790
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

705
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,170

706
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,250
AUDIENCE: You have support for
authorship tying into Google+,

707
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,010
so if somebody authors
a page, they show up.

708
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,770
But you don't do that
for brands.

709
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,130
You don't have any kind of a
form of publishership, so that

710
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,560
even though we have the ability
to tie our logos--

711
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,080
we can tie our pages back to
Google+, but you don't show,

712
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,630
say, our organizational
information in little profiles

713
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,010
next to it the way you
do with authors.

714
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,650
So can you talk about if
that's going to come?

715
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,290
And also, just today, you've--

716
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,220
I mean, an hour ago, you
announced that you're

717
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,500
supporting company logos.

718
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,040
But you're not using
Google+ for that.

719
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,870
You're using schema instead.

720
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,620
ARDAN ARAC: No, the logos I
showed at the top, like the

721
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,570
TuneIn logo, that comes
from Google+.

722
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,610
That doesn't come--

723
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
understand that.

724
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,220
I'm talking about, like, you
understand authorship.

725
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,230
Somebody's written an article.

726
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,930
They'd link to authorship,
right?

727
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,730
ARDAN ARAC: So we didn't really
touch upon authorship,

728
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,430
but that is something I think
about a lot, and a lot of

729
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,050
people on my team also does.

730
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:13,290
So basically, who is the
face behind content.

731
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,650
And we talk about the
voice of TuneIn,

732
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,550
the voice of Starbucks.

733
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,700
But sometimes within that
umbrella is the voice of a

734
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,000
particular author, like
someone's name is

735
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,850
associated with that.

736
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,600
So we didn't go into that, but
there are ways of actually

737
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,230
linking pages to individuals,
+Pages, and that's who gets

738
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,420
[INAUDIBLE].

739
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,633
JOHN HJELMSTAD: I think that's
what he's mentioning.

740
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:37,510
He's wondering what would happen
if a brand essentially

741
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,640
was the publisher, or at
least wanted that to--

742
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,150
AUDIENCE: Well, are there plans
to allow brands to have

743
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,050
that kind of linkage, as opposed
to just their authors?

744
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,330
So if "The New York Times"
wanted to show up, and you

745
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,130
list "The New York Times,"
the "New York Times"--

746
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,180
JOHN HJELMSTAD: If you said,
by "New York Times,"

747
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:50,350
essentially.

748
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,120
AUDIENCE: --might like
to have their logo.

749
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,320
ARDAN ARAC: Yeah, I mean I don't
know the details of that

750
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,210
feature all that much.

751
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,410
But I guess--

752
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,940
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Yeah, I mean
it's something that we've

753
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,440
considered.

754
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,310
And I think the team is trying
to figure out all the

755
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,510
nuances with it.

756
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,750
Because I think part--

757
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,130
and don't quote me too heavily
on this-- part of it is really

758
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:11,150
trying to provide the personal
touch, essentially, of who

759
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,510
specifically wrote it, as
opposed to providing a

760
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,260
different sort of clearinghouse
for kind of like

761
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,710
an umbrella of authorship.

762
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,170
[INAUDIBLE].

763
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,110
But there's a number of really
legitimate use cases for it

764
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,590
too, and so I could try to meet
you afterwards, and get

765
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,500
you in touch with the
PMs for that.

766
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

767
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,520

768
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,250
AUDIENCE: Hi.

769
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,110
I was wondering if you had a
roadmap for the other schema

770
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,160
that are already entities.

771
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,540
So currently it's just
movies and music.

772
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,010
Do you give a published roadmap
of the support for the

773
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:44,270
other ones, specifically for
the local business entity?

774
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:44,790
ARDAN ARAC: Yeah.

775
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,610
Actually, that's definitely
something we're interested in.

776
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:51,850
I don't have a roadmap slide to
show, but it really depends

777
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,660
on two things.

778
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,040
One is like, what idea, what
use case really strikes us?

779
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,760
And I'd actually love
to your ideas.

780
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
You know your service.

781
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,420
You know your content.

782
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,045
We have office hours
right after this.

783
00:33:04,045 --> 00:33:07,070
So if you come to that and say,
hey, here's how we think

784
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,610
you could use our data in
Google, like, that's how-- the

785
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,290
best ideas come from you,
so that's part one.

786
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:16,900
But part two, what really
convinces us to focus on a

787
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,040
certain vertical or a certain
use case is also the data that

788
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,305
we're seeing coming through.

789
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:25,145
Like, if I see a lot of data
coming from apps, sites that

790
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:27,630
are about local businesses,
then we're like, OK, let's

791
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,420
look deeper into this, what we
can do with this, as opposed

792
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,715
to just talking the
hypothetical.

793
00:33:32,715 --> 00:33:36,160
So another way of sort of
getting your use case to the

794
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,140
front of the queue is actually
sending us data integrating

795
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,105
the Google+ Sign-In.

796
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:41,355
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

797
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:48,180

798
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,050
ARDAN ARAC: Sorry, what?

799
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,120
AUDIENCE: Where can
we get the slides?

800
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,060
JOHN HJELMSTAD: I think that'll
end up being posted on

801
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,970
the I/O site after the talk.

802
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:03,300

803
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,240
AUDIENCE: My name and personal
brand happen to clash with an

804
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,300
Italian design heiress
and an Austrian DJ.

805
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,900
Neither one of those has yet
woken up to this and how to

806
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,570
use it and to use it.

807
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:22,590
Now, I've the brand, domain,
got all that in place.

808
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,510
I've claimed my +Page.

809
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,409
So at this point in time, it
should be very easy for me to

810
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,510
get it all set up.

811
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,110
Now meanwhile, sooner or
later, one or both--

812
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,850
probably both of those two--
are going to wake

813
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,540
up to what's happening.

814
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,070
I'm just a little guy.

815
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,750
They, on the other hand,
are actually

816
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,320
quite famous, big entities.

817
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,949
What happens then, if
it's the same brand?

818
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:46,380
ARDAN ARAC: Right.

819
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,239
So this is a hard problem, so
I'm just going to venture my

820
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,429
sort of thought-- like, this is
not a product definition.

821
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,290
But, how I would fix that
is, the key is really

822
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,860
understanding the user's
relationship to

823
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,580
you or to that brand.

824
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,840
So if I know-- like, the basic
example-- if the user follows

825
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,120
you when they search for you,
the likelihood that they're

826
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,460
looking for you is high.

827
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,160
Or another user has signed into
their page with their

828
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,900
Google+ whatever identity, also
the likelihood that they

829
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,090
are interested in
that is high.

830
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,430
So these are very explicit
signals, and they're not as

831
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,900
common as we would like.

832
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,110
But that's kind of the answer,
understanding--

833
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,550
and maybe if my friend
is following you,

834
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,400
that's another signal.

835
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,880
So I guess one way to solve
that is really understand

836
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,410
which user is interested
in which brand.

837
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,920
JOHN HJELMSTAD: And just
expanding upon that a little

838
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,630
bit, of a lot of times we've
seen brand names that are

839
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,570
claimed in, like, Italy versus
the United States-- very

840
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:42,960
simple, right?

841
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,080
That's yet another axis along
which search can be a little

842
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,290
bit more intelligent, based on
geolocation, based on what

843
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,630
language you're searching
in, things of that sort.

844
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,880
And then also, things that we
are rolling out having to do

845
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,950
with automatic hashtagging and
semantic analysis associated

846
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,250
with your content.

847
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,220
If we know that somebody's
very interested in shoes,

848
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,380
maybe we'll show Jimmy Choo.

849
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:12,910
But if somebody's interested
in Jimmy Choo the website

850
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:17,220
maker or something, then
we would trigger that.

851
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,530
But it's very early days
when it comes to the

852
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,920
search aspect of that.

853
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,820
AUDIENCE: It's going to be
very much contextual and

854
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,420
relational then?

855
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,873
ARDAN ARAC: Yeah.

856
00:36:24,873 --> 00:36:25,326
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Yeah.

857
00:36:25,326 --> 00:36:25,780
AUDIENCE: OK.

858
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,250
Thank you very much.

859
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,540
AUDIENCE: Quick question on--
you guys talked about on the

860
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,720
right hand column,
pretty much.

861
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,260
So I just wanted to know how
would that get incorporated

862
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,220
with mobile searches or tablet
searches, et cetera.

863
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:46,110
Is that going to be included
in mobile as well, or--

864
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,500
ARDAN ARAC: The question's
about mobile?

865
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,710
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Mobile
and other displays.

866
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,260
ARDAN ARAC: Good
question, yeah.

867
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,770
So we started with desktop.

868
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,150
Like right now, this
is available--

869
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,760
everything we showed is
available on desktop, but

870
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,220
we're working on
mobile as well.

871
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,340
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Pretty much
anywhere else that search

872
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,920
results would show up, we seek
to integrate it in the most

873
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,790
contextual and non-intrusive
way.

874
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,660
AUDIENCE: And the desktop one's
already public already?

875
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:16,160
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Yes, for
movies and music.

876
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,620
Of course, we'll be rolling
out to more

877
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,410
categories over time.

878
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,660
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

879
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,280

880
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,320
JOHN HJELMSTAD: It doesn't
appear that there's any

881
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,210
questions from the
extended sites.

882
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,115
So if there's any more here?

883
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:34,120
One more.

884
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,010
AUDIENCE: How would this
integrate with the cards?

885
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:36,990
Would it?

886
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,770
ARDAN ARAC: What cards?

887
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,190
AUDIENCE: Well, like Google
Glass cards or Google Now

888
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,190
cards, will you ever see
with a Google Now like

889
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,650
this being the top--

890
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,060
ARDAN ARAC: Oh, I see.

891
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,500
Like Google Now cards?

892
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

893
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,380
ARDAN ARAC: That
is a good idea.

894
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,630
We haven't really thought
about that.

895
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,880
JOHN HJELMSTAD: I mean, it's
another one of the visual form

896
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,490
factors that we're looking into,
to see what the user

897
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,140
experience will be like, whether
it be too cluttered,

898
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,710
whether or not it will provide
contextual and relevant

899
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,650
information.

900
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,340
Anecdotally and intuitively
speaking, it

901
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,820
seems like it would.

902
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,250
And I think that the
teams will continue

903
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,540
to integrate more.

904
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,890
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

905
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,890
JOHN HJELMSTAD: That's all
the time we've got.

906
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,110
ARDAN ARAC: Thank you.

907
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,360
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Thanks
for your time.

908
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,965
