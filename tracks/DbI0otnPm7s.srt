LOUIS GRAY: Hi.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,350
I'm Louis Gray with Google
Developers Live, and welcome

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,730
to the second edition of Google
Developers Weekly-- our

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,510
highlight reel of what's
happening in the world of

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,010
Google Developers on
the set and off.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,710
Last week we kicked off this
show, keeping you on top of

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,020
all of the events in our
studios worldwide.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,430
Let's go to the tape and see
this week's highlights, and

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,610
preview the week to come.

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,200
Google Drive and Google+ Photos
have always been good

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,860
friends, but it's now time to
take that relationship to a

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,299
brand new level.

14
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,090
Ali Ashar took to the studio
to show us how photos in

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,730
Google Drive are now
integrated with

16
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,690
your Google+ account.

17
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,100
Also in the world of Google+,
Joanna Smith invited product

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,660
managers Tor and Joelle to
discuss the launch of the

19
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,360
Google+ domain's API, enabling
companies and enterprises to

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,990
develop tools for
their businesses

21
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,250
on the Google+ platform.

22
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,320
Every single week, our team
from Tel Aviv takes a deep

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,180
dive into the world of APIs or
host experts from the world of

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,240
web and mobile.

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,770
This Wednesday, Ido Green showed
how you can leverage

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,180
the power of NodeJS on Google
Compute Engine to pull

27
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,950
information from the Yahoo
Finance API, and work with

28
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,780
that data in Google Docs.

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,370
This is just another cool
example of how open standards

30
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,610
can help different company
systems work together.

31
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,380
Back here in Mountain View,
Jeremy Walker of the YouTube

32
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,170
team invited guest Vidyard
into the studio.

33
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,310
If you create content on
YouTube, Vidyard can help you

34
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,390
turn your video content into
powerful marketing tools.

35
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,090
And after all, don't
engineers and

36
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,960
developers always love marketing?

37
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,650
The week in the studio wrapped
with the latest entry in our

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,670
Root Access series of growing
your start up and navigating

39
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,320
the world of venture capital.

40
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,940
Don Dodge and Martin Omander
updated us on the biggest

41
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,100
trends from two of the hottest
incubators at Silicon Valley--

42
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,740
500 Startups and Y Combinator.

43
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,760
Also, this next week promises
to be huge.

44
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,510
Brian Fitzpatrick, better
known as "Fitz," will be

45
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,710
taking on three big
topics on GDL.

46
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,870
First, organizational
manipulation.

47
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,860
Then data liberation.

48
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,920
And finally, Google's
Transparency Report.

49
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,670
I'll be fully transparent
with you.

50
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,910
I'm looking forward to asking
him the tough questions on

51
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,970
business politics, and just how
I can get all my data out

52
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,680
of Google if I want to.

53
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,760
Here on GDL, we may not have
Shark Week, but we

54
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,840
do have Fitz week.

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,060
Outside of the studio, Google
Analytics' Nick Mihailovski

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,880
introduced a new analytics
metadata API.

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,920
Now you can find out which API
and which metrics can be

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,960
queried from Google Analytics
core reporting.

59
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,100
Check out our Google Developers

60
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,850
blog for more details.

61
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,690
On our Google+ page, we shared
a post about the new Dart

62
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,230
Editor, which adds new
features and fixes.

63
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,830
The flashiest features, you
can now inspect classes in

64
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,850
running apps.

65
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,290

dartling.org/editor.

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,500
