00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,670

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,900
Hello and welcome to another
episode of GDL IL Google

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,660
Developer Live Israel.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,600
This episode we are going just
to elaborate a bit on the

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,860
service site that we showed in
the last episode of the mobile

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,980
web app with AppScript.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,580
And basically, what I would like
to do is to show you the

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,420
code that we are leveraging in
AppScript inside our Google

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,750
Sheet when we are coming to
build a service site that

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,000
would enable us to manage our
content that later on we'll

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,790
work with and show inside
the mobile web app.

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,520
So let me share my screen.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,560
And as you could see
here, this is how

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,880
a doc is look like.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,930
And you could see here that I'm
having few fields that I

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,500
will ask my editor
to fill for me.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,160
And in a minute, we'll see how
easy it is to work and get an

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,300
address and basically calculate
automatically from

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,760
it the [INAUDIBLE] longitude
and latitude.

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,740
Here, for instance,
as you could see &mdash;

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,960
let me make it bigger.

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,120
I'm just concatenating
using this function.

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,190
So the value of column D will
basically be derived from

24
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,320
column B and C, in this case.

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,310
And here I'll just go and fill
the addresses I would like.

26
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,900
In this example, it's in Hebrew,
but of course, you can

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,820
imagine that it will be in
English or any other language.

28
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,820
The other thing about it will be
that basically you'll to be

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,440
able to work with this.

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,990
And Google Geocoder will work
with any language that you

31
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,370
will be able to be input here.

32
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,340
And we'll see it in a second.

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,400
So those are the input points
that the editor

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,330
will fill for us.

35
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,690
And then, what we'll need to
do is go here to File and

36
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,160
basically publish
it to the web.

37
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,660
And the nice thing here is that
we could choose several

38
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,280
things when we want to do it.

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,650
So once I'm clicking here on
Start Publishing, you could

40
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,210
see that I have here the
timestamp of when

41
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,930
it was first published.

42
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,180
And from this minute any changes
that will be made will

43
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,880
be automatically because I
clicked this check box.

44
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,450
And here I could basically check
and see if I want it as

45
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,580
a web page or maybe as
a Atom feed, RSS

46
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,690
feed, and other things.

47
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,870
If I'm doing things like
exporting it as RSS feed, here

48
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,710
at the end if I'll change
it from RSS to JSON,

49
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,670
it will also work.

50
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,160
So for us, in the front end
development world, to work

51
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,460
with JSON object will be
much easier and nicer.

52
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,560
And we don't need any library
to parse Atom

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,160
feeds or RSS feeds.

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Once I'm doing that, I'll
go here to Tools.

55
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,510
And I'll basically click
on the Script Editor.

56
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,430
And as you can see here, I'm
jumping to a new tab that's

57
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,430
letting me work with
AppScript.

58
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,760
Now here I'll make this code
just a bit larger and we'll go

59
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,610
over quite quickly because
it's a very simple,

60
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,720
self-explanatory code.

61
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,600
What we're doing here is
basically on open I want to

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
add a new menu item.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,200
And let me go back here
and show you.

64
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,490
Here I have a new menu item
that I created for my app.

65
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,650
So my editor, after he or she
are filling the details here,

66
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,140
it's good to be able to
show them on a map.

67
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,360
So when they are clicking, the
script is running in the

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,630
background creating a map.

69
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,952
And as you can see, I have
markers on the map that are

70
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:47,830
just showing visually that what
we did is the correct.

71
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,550
And of course, at the bottom we
have a widget containing a

72
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,880
table with all the details.

73
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,640
Now, in the script itself, this
four or five lines of

74
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,980
code basically just adding this
menu to the spreadsheet

75
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,460
and allowing me to execute the
station location map function.

76
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,860
Actually, I need to put
a better name there.

77
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,630
But it's OK.

78
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,810
In the function itself, what
I'm getting is basically

79
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,500
getting a handler on the current
sheet that I'm going

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,320
to work with.

81
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,760
And in our case, it's
the geo one.

82
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,340
You can think about a scenario
when you want to keep revision

83
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,330
of the history.

84
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,640
That time then maybe you will
add more and more sheets to

85
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,940
this main doc.

86
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,110
After that I'm going and I'm
using Get Range function.

87
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,600
And basically, I'm just focusing
on a portion of this

88
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,270
spreadsheet just so I'll be
able to get the station

89
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,090
information.

90
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,760
In my case, I want to get the
address and then the city name

91
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,130
because from the combination of
those two I'll be able to

92
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,270
compose the address.

93
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,770
Later on, I'm just calling a
static map object and of

94
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,492
course, creating my UI.

95
00:05:03,492 --> 00:05:08,150
The UI is the dialog that you
saw that we presented the user

96
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,340
after we gathered all
the information.

97
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,510
And then I'm creating another
grid object that's letting me

98
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,540
up the raw text information
below the map so it will be

99
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,440
very clear which marker is
belonging to which station.

100
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,670
And then, there's the simple
loop that's just going over

101
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,280
those lines with addresses,
adding them to the map, as you

102
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,290
could see here, with
the marker info.

103
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:40,260
In our case, that row and
column, so the cell itself,

104
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,960
will contain the geo location.

105
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,170
And it's very easy to use that
marker with a geo point just

106
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,490
to put it in a certain
place on the map.

107
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,830
And for the grid widget, of
course, we'll want the full

108
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,840
address and the name and
all the other things.

109
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,540
Here there's an interesting
thing that I would

110
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,260
love to show you.

111
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,350
And I'll put a break point.

112
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,240
And we'll go into
it in a second.

113
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,430
And that's the newGeocoder
object that will basically

114
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,453
allow us to get the address and
to extract and gain from

115
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,200
it the longitude and latitude.

116
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,810
You could get actually more geo
information out of this,

117
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,520
but in this example, we'll
just focus on these two

118
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,380
because that's what we need
to create our basic app.

119
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,540
Let me try and run it in the
debug mode and show you how

120
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,790
it's working.

121
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,670
So here is a function
that I choose.

122
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,810
And now I'll click debugging.

123
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,210
And the first time that you run
it, you'll get a very big

124
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,420
dialogue that just warns
you and ask your

125
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,810
permission to do so.

126
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,960
I did it in the final rehearsal
to this show, so it

127
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,860
doesn't prompt it now to me.

128
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,990
But after you acknowledge it
for the first time, it will

129
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,281
work on each and every run.

130
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:54,870
As you saw here, I just
got this break point.

131
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,290
And if I'll, of course, go over
geoResults, you could see

132
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,120
here that it's undefined.

133
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,320
But if I'll just give it
permission to pass it, now you

134
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,300
see here that in geoResults,
if I'll click on the plus

135
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,280
sign, basically we
got two things.

136
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,400
One is the status.

137
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,460
And luckily for us,
everything is OK.

138
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,580
So that's why here, on the next
line, I'll just make sure

139
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,500
that it's OK.

140
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,640
If it's OK, I can
parse the data.

141
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,670
If it's not, I want to log it.

142
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,960
And it's here.

143
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,460
And if it's OK, like in our
case, you could see the

144
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,890
results object that's containing
lots of different

145
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,340
parameters.

146
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,530
In our case, we have the
geometry that's containing

147
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,960
bounds, viewports, location
data, and

148
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,500
lots of other things.

149
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,800
And in our case, as you could
see, I'm taking the longitude

150
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,000
and the latitude, just the
opposite what I said, and once

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,720
I got those two, I can release
it and just keep running and

152
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,400
getting a new point each time.

153
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,600
We could click on the view and
then basically see the logs.

154
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,670
And as you could see while I'm
using the logger object, as

155
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,820
you could see, I got the
new geo point from

156
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,340
the specific address.

157
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,760
I can now just turn off the
break point and resume the run

158
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,670
of this script.

159
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,800
And after it's done, you see
that everything is off from

160
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
the debug mode.

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,330
I can again to the logs and see
that for the three points

162
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,200
that I have in the spreadsheet
I now have three geo points

163
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,100
that I could use.

164
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,179
One last nice little trick
that we have here is that

165
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,840
we're using Waze web API.

166
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,850
And if you are basically, in
your mobile web app, putting

167
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,770
this link and the user will open
your mobile web app from

168
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,010
any mobile devices out there,
and they already have Waze

169
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,110
installed, this link will
basically inform the device

170
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,610
itself to open the Waze
application with these

171
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,410
specific points.

172
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,750
So they could navigate to
this point immediately.

173
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,150
The app itself &mdash;

174
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,180
just to show you how
does it look like &mdash;

175
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,750
is live and it's here.

176
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,515
And we have two versions
of the app.

177
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:09,280
One looks like that.

178
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,870
And that's basically
a version that is

179
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,200
based on Twitter Bootstrap.

180
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,170
So it will work on all the major
browsers out there, i.e.

181
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,520
Firefox, Safari, and
of course, Chrome.

182
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:26,610
And another version of it is
[INAUDIBLE], but just add

183
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,510
jQuery [INAUDIBLE]

184
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,635
to the picture.

185
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:31,920
And it will be here.

186
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,610

187
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,590
And as you could see, it's more
themed as a mobile web

188
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,870
app with some nice features,
like an about page that is

189
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,820
flipping and other things that
you could do, like the buttons

190
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,710
that will navigate and
other cool things.

191
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,090
Of course, the map here
is fully functional.

192
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:58,420
And the user can dive into it
and get direction on points

193
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,490
and lots of other things.

194
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,690
So that's basically the
major three components

195
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,390
that I wanted to cover.

196
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,070
If you have any questions
now it's an

197
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,690
excellent time to do so.

198
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,680
And if not, just feel
free to reach out to

199
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,880
me on G+, on Twitter.

200
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,400
On both of them, it's greenido
as one word.

201
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,100
Let's see if we have on the
Hangout chat some question

202
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,520
that people entered.

203
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,540

204
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,380
I don't see any, so until next
week be strong and bye-bye.

205
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:43,262
