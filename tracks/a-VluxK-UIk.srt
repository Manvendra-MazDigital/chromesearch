LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to Google
Developers Weekly for December

3
00:00:06,152 --> 00:00:11,554
18, 2013, our 17th and final
weekly wrap up for the year.

4
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,470
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,200
of what's happening in the world
of Google Developers on the set

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,600
and off.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,400
Last week we hosted four
special edition segments

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,000
in celebration of Computer
Science Education Week

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,060
and the Hour Of Code campaign.

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,010
Here's how it all went down.

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,460
To kick things off, Van
Riper hosted three students

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,350
from GDG Fresno High, as
well as the group's sponsors,

13
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,310
Joshua and Courtney Woodward.

14
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,000
Mamie Rheingold chatted
with the founder

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,410
of code.org, Hadi
Partovi, who shared

16
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,250
why getting 10
million kids to code

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,680
is crucial for the
success of every industry.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,110
In our third segment,
Deena Shakir and Girls

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,170
Who Code Founder Reshma
Saujani shared how developers

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,800
can make an impact in
teaching girls to code.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,020
And on Friday, Natalie
Villalobos hosted

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,800
noted entrepreneur
Limor Fried, who

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,930
explained why
engineering isn't boring,

24
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,270
whether it's LED shoes
or DIY home automation.

25
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,700
You can find all these
segments on our YouTube channel

26
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,320
and on our Google
Developers Google+ page.

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,900
We then welcomed John Faig,
Darrel Sumi from Talkray,

28
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,750
and Brad Green from
Google's Angular team

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,460
into the studio for a talk
on building Chrome packaged

30
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,350
apps using AngularJS.

31
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,170
John and Darrel
discussed critical points

32
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,910
in transitioning
from regular web apps

33
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,100
to Chrome packaged apps,
as well as why AngularJS

34
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,010
makes for a great fit
with packaged apps.

35
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,960
Some of the most
helpful technical tips

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,350
come from friendly people
you've never even met,

37
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,900
like the active communities on
Stack Overflow in our YouTube

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,630
API community members.

39
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,790
This week we invited YouTube
API Google Developer experts,

40
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,480
who we call GDEs, Matias
Molinas, Tim Wintle and Jarom

41
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,690
McDonald to the studio
to learn from them

42
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,690
face to face and see what they
find fascinating about taking

43
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,960
on top code challenges.

44
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,800
Of course, you can always learn
more about the GDE program

45
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,430
by visiting
developers.google.com/experts.

46
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,550
Staying in YouTube land, Ibrahim
Ulukaya hosted split media labs

47
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,080
explaining how the X Split
broadcaster integrates

48
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,230
with the YouTube
live streaming API

49
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,430
to create an easy and powerful
game streaming experience.

50
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,790
Back in my day, when I
fired up my Nintendo,

51
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,640
the only person who would
watch me was my brother.

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,430
Now you can see all my complete
lack of skills and failure

53
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,620
to get to the next
level live on the web.

54
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,660
And finally, from the lawn, in
the latest volley from the GDL

55
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,020
Italia series,
Michele [? Orlessi ?]

56
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,940
presents on how you can deploy
a PHP application on Google App

57
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,150
Engine.

58
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,327
Beyond our studios, the
latest Chrome experiment

59
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:33,910
takes you to Middle
Earth in the world

60
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,270
of a new movie, The Hobbit
- The Desolation Of Smaug.

61
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,550
Check out the case
study on html5rocks.com,

62
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,210
that's html5rocks.com, to
learn how the team accomplished

63
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,740
the amazing interactivity
of this experiment.

64
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,450
But watch out for dragons.

65
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,750
Last week [? Miley Olya
?] and the webmaster team

66
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,519

00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,930
and get handy tips for making
users happier with your sites.

69
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,330
Also last week, Google+ Sign
In for your apps got smarter.

70
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,000
Google+ Sign In now supports
Google Apps accounts,

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,010
incremental auth, and migration
from other auth methods.

72
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,510
Take a look at the
Google Developers

73
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,120
blog for all of the details.

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,910
And finally, more news from the
folks working to make the web

75
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,630
faster.

76
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,170
The resource timing
API is now available.

77
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,880
This API enables you to
track timing information

78
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,740
about every resource
on the page,

79
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,270
so you can measure
and then optimize.

80
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,060
And to make sure that you never
miss a thing from the world

81
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,910
