00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,464

2
00:00:01,464 --> 00:00:03,280
SHALINI AGARWAL: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to Actions in the inbox
powered by schemas.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,045
I'm Shalini Agarwal.

5
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:09,530
This is Claudio Cherubino.

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,050
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Hi.

7
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,890
SHALINI AGARWAL: And we are
really excited to be here

8
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,290
today to tell you about a cool
new feature that we are

9
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,880
launching in Gmail.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,000
So let's start with
a show of hands.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,710
How many of you send emails
to your users

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,970
asking them to do something?

13
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,320
All right.

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,740
How many of you care if your
users actually do what you ask

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,620
them to do?

16
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,260
Perfect.

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,900
OK, so then you know that
today we have a problem.

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,910
Email is not efficient.

19
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,880
It's like a scavenger hunt
trying to do anything.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,230
For every email that you send
your users, they have to read

21
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,296
the email, figure out what they
need to do, open a bunch

22
00:00:57,296 --> 00:01:02,180
of tabs, decide to take action,
and then do it.

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,480
It's a lot of steps,
and each email

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,020
takes too long to process.

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,230
That's even if the user decides
to open the email in

26
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,910
the first place.

27
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,180
So let's go ahead and see this
in efficiency in action.

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,990
How many steps do you think it
takes to rate and review a

29
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,020
restaurant?

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,310
First, you get the email.

31
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,940
Second, you click on it, you
read it, and you decide that

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,860
you're going to click
on a link.

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,100
Third, you click on the link.

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,320
You open the tab and you
wait for it to load.

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,680
Fourth, if you remember your
login information,

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,070
you enter it here.

37
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,220
And fifth, you do what you
wanted to do in the first

38
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,980
place, which is rate and review
the restaurant, and

39
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,200
click Submit.

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,370
And then sixth, you
close the tab.

41
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,530
And if you remember, you go back
to your inbox to process

42
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,190
the next email.

43
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,670
It's a very cumbersome process,
and users get lost

44
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,920
along the way.

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,610

46
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,660
This inefficiency is only
made worse by the

47
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,210
sheer volume of email.

48
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,330
As a product manager at Google,
I get a lot of email.

49
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,800
In fact, I counted.

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,030
And in the last week alone,
I received 2,124 emails.

51
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,040
During this session alone,
over 100 million

52
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,060
emails will be sent.

53
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,550
Your users are out there doing
this scavenger hunt right now.

54
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,700
Between email inefficiency and
email volume, it's no wonder

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,330
that a lot of emails go
unanswered or unopened.

56
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,000

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,440
You are probably tracking
your own stats and see

58
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,360
some of that today.

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,120
But today, we are introducing
a solution.

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,260
We're adding actions to the
inbox, making email smarter.

61
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,990
Now, your users can get the gist
of what you're trying to

62
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,690
tell them and take action
without ever leaving the

63
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,710
inbox, without even
opening email.

64
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,890
So remember the six-step process
that we talked about?

65
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,010
Let's see what that looks like
with actions in the inbox.

66
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,040
With actions in the inbox, we're
taking that six-step

67
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,500
process and turning it
into just two steps.

68
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,800
We'll take a look at
it with a demo.

69
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,860

70
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:41,000
Last night, I ordered food
from India Clay Oven via

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,750
Seamless web.

72
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,480
Today, Seamless has sent me an
email asking me to rate my

73
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,370
experience.

74
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,640
Seamless have added actions
to their email.

75
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,010
So I see the email, Seamless,
asking me how

76
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,160
was India Clay Oven?

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,140
And I get this handy button
on the right-hand

78
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,780
side that says Review.

79
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,920
I click on it, and I get this
beautiful overlay that gives

80
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,390
me the key information
I need &mdash;

81
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,890
India Clay Oven via Seamless,
a beautiful picture from the

82
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,860
restaurant, and a quick
rating widget.

83
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,010
So I can go ahead and
click it five

84
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,310
stars and enter a comment.

85
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,690
Spicetastic.

86
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,610
Will definitely be back.

87
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,079
Definitely order again.

88
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,230

89
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,880
And I hit Post Review.

90
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,640
On the back end, Gmail has now
sent this rating to Seamless,

91
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,930
and I'm done.

92
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,893
That's it.

93
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:34,865
[APPLAUSE]

94
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:35,851
SHALINI AGARWAL: Two steps.

95
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:37,101
Now, that's efficient.

96
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:42,528

97
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:44,450
Let's go back.

98
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,230
So we've enabled actions
in the inbox through

99
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,580
the power of schemas.

100
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,050
You guys already know
about schemas.

101
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,810
They're an important part
of the web today.

102
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,910
You add markup to your websites
to improve your

103
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,780
search results.

104
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,420
Now, you can add markup to your
emails to enable these

105
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,780
actions directly from
the inbox and

106
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,050
deliver them to Gmail.

107
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,340
You can deliver a slice
of your app to

108
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,340
Gmail starting today.

109
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,345
A product with hundreds
of millions of users.

110
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:21,860

111
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,970
Over the coming weeks, we'll be
rolling out four different

112
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,150
kinds of actions.

113
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,490
We've already talked about rate
and review, and now we'll

114
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,980
talk about the one-click action,
the RSVP action, and

115
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,230
the goto action.

116
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,540

117
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,205
And, of course, we'll
do it through demos.

118
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:41,680

119
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,880
So as you can see here, I've
gotten an email from Google

120
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,240
Offers about an offer from
American Apparel.

121
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,200
Because they've added schema
to their emails, I get this

122
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,570
one-click button that
says Get Offer.

123
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,620
Because I shop at American
Apparel all the time, I'll go

124
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,080
ahead and click the offer.

125
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,830
One click, without
ever leaving the

126
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,920
inbox, I saved the offer.

127
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,830
Now, let's go over to
offers.google.com, reload the

128
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,460
tab, and there it is.

129
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,690
I didn't even have to open an
email and I've been able to

130
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,850
save my offer.

131
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:20,030
Now, one-click buttons are my
favorite action because they

132
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,900
enable the widest variety
of use cases.

133
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,260
So let's look at a second demo
of the one-click action.

134
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,250
I use a service called Esna to
manage my communications.

135
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,100
And they've sent me this email
telling me that I have missed

136
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,010
a call from Claudio.

137
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,570
And because now seems like a
good enough time as any to

138
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,710
call him back, I'll click
this one-click

139
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,520
button that says Dial.

140
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,090
Now, on the back end, what's
happening is that Gmail has

141
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,545
notified Esna that I want
to initiate the call.

142
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:57,370
[PHONE RINGING]

143
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,960
SHALINI AGARWAL: And they've
initiated the call between

144
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,810
Claudio and myself.

145
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,740
As you can see, my
phone is ringing.

146
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,180
I'll Go ahead and pick it up.

147
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,510
I don't know if Claudio's
going to pick it up.

148
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,380
We'll find out.

149
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,200
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Probably not.

150
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,470
SHALINI AGARWAL: So he'll be
receiving a call any minute

151
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,453
now that I've picked it up.

152
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:11,380
[PHONE RINGING]

153
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,896
SHALINI AGARWAL: And
there we go.

154
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:14,290
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Woo.

155
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,388
[APPLAUSE]

156
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:17,820
SHALINI AGARWAL: All right.

157
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,030
One click directly
from the inbox.

158
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,380
The third type of action
is the RSVP action.

159
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,100
As you can see here, Clarence
has invited me to a taco

160
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,790
night, which is my favorite
type of event.

161
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,810
Because Calendar has added
actions to the inbox with some

162
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,320
markup, I get this RSVP button
right here, similar to rate

163
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,140
and review.

164
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,410
When I click on it, I get the
overlay showing me the most

165
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,280
important information.

166
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,870
The fact that it's a taco night

167
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,976
hosted by Google Calendar.

168
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:52,690
It's on Tuesday at 7:00 PM.

169
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,160
It's at Tortilla Heights, and
one person's already going.

170
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,410
I don't miss a taco night.

171
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,640
So, of course, I'm
going to say yes.

172
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,230
And there it is.

173
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,990
I'm done.

174
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,780
Let's go over to Google Calendar
and make sure that my

175
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,390
response was recorded.

176
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,370
Here it is, Taco Night.

177
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,650
I click on it and there it is.

178
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,900
Yes, I'm going.

179
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,810

180
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,220
The fourth and final type of
action is the goto action.

181
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,210
The goto action is reserved for
the most complex type of

182
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,700
actions, which really
cannot be handled

183
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,790
from within the inbox.

184
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,580
So flight check-in, as you can
see here, the last email from

185
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,230
Oceanic Airlines, I get a button
on the right-hand side.

186
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,590
They've used the goto action.

187
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,460
When I click on this button,
it'll take me to a deep link

188
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,420
on their website to check-in,
where I can select my seat.

189
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,680
I can tell them how many
bags I'm bringing.

190
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,900
And whatever security
questions I

191
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,820
might have to answer.

192
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,790
And that's it.

193
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,840
Those are the four
types of actions.

194
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,880
However, sometimes no
action is required.

195
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,900
Sometimes your users just need
key information from you.

196
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:10,750
So for these situations,
we've added

197
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,820
structured interactive cards.

198
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,950
The first one that we're
adding is for flight.

199
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,520
So when users get flight
confirmation email, check-in

200
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,970
reminders, or updates, they get
this beautiful card at the

201
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,970
top of their email that gives
them the airport details, the

202
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:33,030
flight details, their connection
times, as well as a

203
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,990
real-time layer on top of that
telling them if their flight

204
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,670
is on-time, delayed, or &mdash;
hopefully not &mdash; canceled.

205
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,470
Flight is only the first
card we're adding.

206
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,070
Over time, we'll add
more cards, such

207
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,450
as events and hotels.

208
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,546

209
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:54,920
So by adding schema to your
emails, you can enable these

210
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,630
actions and cards in Gmail.

211
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,000
However, you can also enable
experiences for your users

212
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,430
across Google.

213
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,120
When your users use Google Now
or Google Search, they will

214
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,660
get the information that you
send them at the most useful

215
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,060
time and place.

216
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,190

217
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,210
I'll leave you with
one last thought.

218
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,000
This is a developer platform,
and the power of it really

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,190
comes in how you decide
to use it.

220
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,810
We'll be rolling out these
features over the next few

221
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,620
weeks and be adding
more over time.

222
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,110
Now, I'll hand it over
to Claudio to tell

223
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,360
you how it all works.

224
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,890

225
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,470
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Thanks, Shalini.

226
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,856
[APPLAUSE]

227
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:47,030
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Well, thank you.

228
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,350
I haven't done anything yet.

229
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,140

230
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,430
So I'm very happy to be here.

231
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,160
I work in the developer
relations team from Google.

232
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,090
And one of the questions that
I always get when talking to

233
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:09,500
developers like you is, how do
I get my app into Gmail?

234
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,740
It's a common request.

235
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,950
I understand why you want to be
in Gmail, why you want your

236
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,120
app in Gmail.

237
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,480
And today, we're finally
introducing a way

238
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,190
for you to do that.

239
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,920
And what we're introducing
is super simple.

240
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,290
So not only we're giving you
this opportunity, but we're

241
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,750
giving an opportunity in the
easiest possible way.

242
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,520
All it takes is some markup
that you have

243
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,670
to add to your emails.

244
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,030
So you have your emails.

245
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,040
You probably already send
emails to your users.

246
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,465
So you have an HTML email
with your content,

247
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:45,080
your regular content.

248
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,980
You don't have to touch it.

249
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,100
You don't have to do anything
with the content you're

250
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,470
already sending.

251
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,110
All you have to do is add in
some markup, some extra markup

252
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,360
to the same emails, and
then clients will

253
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,070
render that for you.

254
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,860
So you add some markup at the
top of your email, at the

255
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,190
bottom of your email, in the
middle, somewhere in your

256
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,590
HTML, and clients, like Gmail,
will render it for you.

257
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,290
I say clients like Gmail, and
I will go back to this,

258
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,940
because this is going to
be an open platform.

259
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,030
And Gmail is starting
to launch this

260
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,840
in the coming weeks.

261
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,440
But we expect other clients
to implement

262
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,290
this technology, too.

263
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,860
So what happens when you add
your schema is that we render

264
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:36,960
it as the corresponding button
or drop down or piece of UI or

265
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,680
card, whatever corresponds
to your markup.

266
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,870
And one important thing to note
there is that the UI is

267
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,800
consistent.

268
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,480
So Gmail will always render an
event reservation, RSVP drop

269
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,480
down with the same
UI, regardless

270
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,090
of who's the sender.

271
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:05,250
So your user will not be
confused by messy UI or a

272
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,900
piece of interface that do not
really belong to Gmail.

273
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,310
The client controls the
experience, and that's really

274
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,850
important for the user, is not
to be confused, to use this

275
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,680
technology.

276
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,560
So you add the markup.

277
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,270
It's going to be a few lines.

278
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,700
I'm going to show that.

279
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,010
And we will render it.

280
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,430
And the one thing that I just
mentioned is that this is

281
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,190
based on an open platform.

282
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,670
We're building on top of
schema.org, which is a broader

283
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:39,910
initiative, open initiative for
a vocabulary of entities

284
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,720
that we're building on top of.

285
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,110
So the types we're defining, the
types you will use in your

286
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,440
markup are the same types that
you're already using if you

287
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,230
know about schema.org.

288
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,530
Well, let's show an example.

289
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,200
This is how it looks like.

290
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,400
And I actually have two
different formats, because we

291
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,770
support two different formats
for this markup.

292
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:09,890
The one on your left is the
standard schema.org migrator.

293
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,810
If you know about schema.org
and semantic web, you've

294
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,950
probably seen this.

295
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,150
You probably implemented this.

296
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,320
You probably added this
to your HTML.

297
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,750
It's pretty easy
to understand.

298
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,320
It's an XML-based language.

299
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,590
Actually, what you do here is
that you add some properties

300
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,120
to your HTML.

301
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,410
And these properties attributes
will tell us what

302
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,920
the item is.

303
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,980
And in this example,
we have an event.

304
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,850
And then what properties
the event has &mdash;

305
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,700
the start time, the end time,
location, and so on.

306
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,440
The same thing can
be also expressed

307
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,550
with a different format.

308
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,010
There is also now the
open standard.

309
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,660
It's called JSON [? lt. ?]

310
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,470
It is not XML-based.

311
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,540
It's obviously JSON-based.

312
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,550
And we found that this other
format, this alternative

313
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,370
format is easier to
read for humans.

314
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,790
There are libraries to write
both, so you as a developer

315
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,460
can, probably, easily
write both.

316
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,730
But for a human, the one on the
right is easier to write.

317
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,520
So as you can see, those 10
lines, and the ones on the

318
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,400
right are just easier to read,
tell us that this email is

319
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,380
about an event.

320
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,800
And that event starts at this
date, ends at that date, and

321
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,850
there's also location.

322
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:27,940
And we will render it as an
event should be rendered.

323
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,330
So we have the markup, different
markup for the four

324
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,200
different types of actions, and

325
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,750
structure data like flights.

326
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,400
I will show you an example
of each of them.

327
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,350
And I would say that
all of them are

328
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,870
shorter than 10 lines.

329
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,490
Well, no more than 20 lines.

330
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,850
So we have four different
types of action.

331
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,500
And we'll see them one by one.

332
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,960
But all of them follow
the same structure.

333
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,290
So you will see that there are
common sections every time I

334
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,160
introduce a new type.

335
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,480
And the sections are,
essentially, three sections in

336
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,670
each markup.

337
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,380
So we usually have a section at
the top that is about the

338
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,410
entity you're defining.

339
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,720
And that is, for instance, in
the example we just saw, to

340
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,730
describe what the event is
or what the flight is.

341
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,710
So the entity you're
talking about.

342
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,180
And that has properties that you
can see from schema.org,

343
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,350
from the vocabulary
we're using.

344
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:34,800
And after the item definition,
we have our first addition to

345
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,180
the schema, which is actions.

346
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,390
Actions have different types
and have different names.

347
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,410
So if you want to implement the
RSVP action or our review

348
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,520
action, those have
different types.

349
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,310
And you have to specify
that there.

350
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,000
But then, in the third
part, you describe

351
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,430
what the handler is.

352
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,370
The handler is used to tell us
what to do with the action.

353
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,510
So you've seen Gmail sending
requests to you when the user

354
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,090
performs an action.

355
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,599
Those requests will be sent to
a URL, to an end point, to a

356
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,670
servlet, to somewhere
you tell us.

357
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,060
And that is where
you define it.

358
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,849
Let's go on with the
real example.

359
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,660

360
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,069
The first type of action &mdash;

361
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,220
I'm going to show you
the markup for &mdash;

362
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,430
is one-click action.

363
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,849
This is what Shalini called
her favorite.

364
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:30,030
Because this is super-flexible.

365
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,110
Gmail renders these one-click
actions as buttons.

366
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,230
When the user clicks on the
button, Gmail will send a

367
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,720
request to your endpoint.

368
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,470
So how this works in the
microdata, in the markup you

369
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,015
see, in this example I'm
showing an email

370
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:50,600
that is about a movie.

371
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,830
And one action we can perform
with one click

372
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,490
is Add to Your Queue.

373
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,780
So at the top, you
will see some

374
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,070
information about the movie &mdash;

375
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,650
movie title, and maybe the cast,
maybe genre, all the

376
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,170
other properties
we want to add.

377
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,440
And then we have the action.

378
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,540
The action in this case
is called Save action.

379
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,530
There will be a list of all the
supported actions in the

380
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,370
docs that we're launching
right now.

381
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,280
So at the end of this talk, I
will give you a link to the

382
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,410
documentation we're launching.

383
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,750
But this action is called
Save action.

384
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,890
You can customize what the
button will look like.

385
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,670
So you can customize the
label for the button.

386
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,510
And we're going to call
it Add to Queue.

387
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,650
And then you define the
action handler.

388
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,480
In this case, what you need to
do is just say, when the user

389
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,310
clicks on a button, I want a
post request sent to my URL.

390
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,990
So you send us this markup.

391
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,820
You set up a servlet that
can handle this request.

392
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,740
When Gmail sends your request
in the background, you will

393
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,250
have to handle the request &mdash;

394
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,760
in this case, add the
movie to the queue &mdash;

395
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,440
and respond with a standard
HTTP response code.

396
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,640
So if the action is performed
correctly, you respond with a

397
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,720
200 and Gmail will show it
as successfully executed.

398
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,310
If there is an error &mdash;
for instance,

399
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,410
the request is invalid &mdash;

400
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,550
you respond with a 400.

401
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,190
Standard HTTP response code.

402
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,030
You know about that.

403
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,630
So this is the common
structure &mdash;

404
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,360
entity, action, action
handler.

405
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,815
And you will see the same
structure in the second type

406
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:21,260
of action we are
defining here.

407
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,190
This is RSVP action.

408
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,920
The main difference here is
that Gmail knows that RSVP

409
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,970
actions deserve a special UI,
which is not a button.

410
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,130
But it's, instead, a drop down
with some information about

411
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,290
the entity, which is an event.

412
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,980
And then, buttons for
you to reply.

413
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,800
You, as a developer, can choose,
if you want, yes,

414
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,970
maybe, no, all of them,
just yes and no.

415
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,350
You can customize the look
of this small drop down.

416
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,830
And once that is rendered, the
result is always the same.

417
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,950
Gmail renders it.

418
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,880
The user clicks on one of the
actions, one of the buttons.

419
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,470
Gmail collects the input from
the user, sends that as a post

420
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,770
request to your endpoint with
the parameters you want.

421
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,320
You process it and
respond with the

422
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,860
appropriate response code.

423
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,550
So on your side, we'll still
have to implement some

424
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,140
servlet, some back end
that can handle this.

425
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,200
And then, Gmail will talk
to this directly.

426
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,590
Now that you know two of them,
this is going to be super easy

427
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,950
to understand &mdash; rate
and review.

428
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,550
You saw that in the
first demo.

429
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,810
We showed Seamless, which is
one of our partners, using

430
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,260
this technology to review
restaurants from the inbox.

431
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,710
What you can customize
here is the scale.

432
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,540
And in our case, there was
one to five stars.

433
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,750
And you can also tell us if
you want an optional text

434
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,110
feedback or if you want a
required text feedback.

435
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,540
It's up to you.

436
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,050
Some companies need that, some
websites need both a text

437
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,340
comment and a rating.

438
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,360
Some others do not.

439
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,820
Of course, the easier it is
for your users, the more

440
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,110
responses you will get.

441
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,020
So that's basically it.

442
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,970
You configure it, and
then &mdash; same thing.

443
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,580
You get a request from Gmail.

444
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,070
You respond to it,
and that's it.

445
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,640
And we render the response.

446
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,640
The only action type that is
slightly different is the goto

447
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,000
link, goto action.

448
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,400
This is rendered as a
button with a link.

449
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,340
We talked about check-in.

450
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,370
Check-in is not an action
that can be performed

451
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,760
easily in the inbox.

452
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,750
You have to select seats,
buy upgrades,

453
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,950
select food, meal, whatever.

454
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,640
You have to do many steps.

455
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,960
And that doesn't really apply
to inside your inbox.

456
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,770
So we can take you directly
to the page

457
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,080
where you can do that.

458
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,880
Another example &mdash;

459
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,090
and we have it here &mdash;

460
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,600
is a request for you to
sign some documents.

461
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,340
The documents are not
sent in the email.

462
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,430
You can click on the link and
be brought to the page where

463
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,540
you can sign the documents.

464
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:03,880
So we strongly recommend you
to use and implement the

465
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,850
in-app actions, like RSVP,
review, or one-click action.

466
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,910
Because with those, users do not
have to leave the inbox.

467
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,940
For all other cases, you can use
a goto action if that is

468
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,360
the best user experience
for your user.

469
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,910
Of course, we plan to
add more actions.

470
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,870
And we want to listen from you
about what you think might be

471
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,870
useful to add.

472
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,940
So we'll talk about it later,
but we want to know what you

473
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,270
plan to do with this.

474
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,210
So we show all the four
types of actions.

475
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,480
The other thing we're launching
is structured data

476
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,070
for specific items.

477
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,850
And we talked about flights.

478
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:50,810
A flight is easy to understand
piece of structured data.

479
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,700
A flight has some specific
properties.

480
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,460
So we know about those
properties.

481
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,950
We know that a flight
has a departure

482
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,890
airport, an arrival airport.

483
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,040
If you markup those properties
in the emails you send, then

484
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,100
we can show that as a
card in Gmail and in

485
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,920
Search and in Now.

486
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,590
We can also add buttons
to that, like

487
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,390
check-in if you want.

488
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,210
But another important thing here
is that Gmail will use

489
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,060
the markup you send us
to show the card.

490
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,590
But also, Gmail will update the
information for a flight

491
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,310
once we know that is a flight
with live data.

492
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,580
So you send us information about
a flight that leaves

493
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,690
tomorrow at 8:00.

494
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,260
If tomorrow we realize that the
flight is delayed, Gmail

495
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,060
will know that.

496
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,030
And when you open the card,
you will see the live

497
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,330
information.

498
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,300
It will say that the flight
is delayed tonight.

499
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,980
And same thing, we'll do the
other properties, like Google

500
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,600
[INAUDIBLE] will do.

501
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,170
So we have these four types
of actions in flights.

502
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,945
And you might have recognized
some names in the slides that

503
00:23:56,945 --> 00:23:57,920
I showed you.

504
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,480
That's because today, we're
launching with many partners.

505
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,110
We've been working with partners
in the past few weeks

506
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,240
and months.

507
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,140
And today, we're very happy to
have many, many partners ready

508
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,110
to support this technology.

509
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,980
You probably know and use
some of these products.

510
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,520
Some of these names are here
at Google I/O, and would be

511
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,760
very happy to talk about their
integration and their

512
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,120
experience with this.

513
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,820
They are upstairs in the third
floor in the Chrome & Apps

514
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,250
sandbox area.

515
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,490
And after this talk, Shalini
and I, the rest of the team

516
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,670
and the partners that are here,
we'll all be upstairs

517
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,310
for you to talk about this.

518
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,530
So if you want to know more
about this, please join us

519
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,960
right after this in the Chrome
& Apps sandbox area.

520
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,420
So, OK, you know about
what you can do.

521
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,780
You've seen what other
people have done.

522
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,670
You might wonder, how
do I join this?

523
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,150
How do I do this myself?

524
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,680
Well, first of all, there is
the documentation we're

525
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,580
launching right now.

526
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,380
It's probably live already.

527
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,942
And that documentation is
at developers.googl

528
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:18,170
e.com/gmail/schemas.

529
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,890
So you can go there and find
all documentation about all

530
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,870
the types we support,
all the actions.

531
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,535
There are examples.

532
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:27,910
There are tutorials, anything
you need to get started now.

533
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,880
And I want to stress this.

534
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,290
You can start now.

535
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,360
Because when you go home
tonight, you can test these

536
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,370
yourself by sending emails
with markup to yourself.

537
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,510
This is a very, very easy
way for you to test it.

538
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,890
So we care about user
experience.

539
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,320
So we need to make sure that
what lands into production,

540
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,690
what lands into everyone's
inbox is safe.

541
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,710
But if you want to test it
yourself, you can just send

542
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,080
emails to yourself.

543
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,300
And those will be processed
and rendered.

544
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,360
So you have an immediate,
easy way to test it now.

545
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,450
Once you test everything and
you have a compelling use

546
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:18,550
case, and you want to launch
this to production, please go

547
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:22,850
back to developers.googl
e.com/gmail/schemas.

548
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,980
There is a page where
you can sign up.

549
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,170
At that page, you will find a
forum where you can tell us

550
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,110
about your use case.

551
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,270
And you can tell us about how
that work and what the

552
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,880
advantage the user have.

553
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,370
Because what we want here is
not just to add buttons

554
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,090
everywhere.

555
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,870
Because that doesn't really
help the users.

556
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,130
What we want here is to add
exciting use cases, exciting

557
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,240
features, better ways
for your users to do

558
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,980
stuff inside Gmail.

559
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,130
So please get back to us.

560
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,450
And we promise to review your
application and get back to

561
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,590
you as soon as possible.

562
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,590
We promise to be very quick.

563
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,635
So everything is at
developers.googl

564
00:27:04,635 --> 00:27:09,670
e.com/gmail/schemas.

565
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,960
And with that, I think
that's it.

566
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,960
We showed you everything we
wanted you to know about this

567
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,430
for this launch.

568
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,290
I just want to remind you that
we're going to be upstairs

569
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,130
after this talk, the whole team
is going to be there.

570
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,550
But we still got 10 minutes
for questions.

571
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,560
So Shalini and I
would be really

572
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,870
happy to get your questions.

573
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,244
Thank you.

574
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:38,164
[APPLAUSE]

575
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:39,860
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Do
we need microphones?

576
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,420
Can you step to the
microphone?

577
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,230
I think it's going
to be recorded.

578
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,890
It's actually Livestreamed.

579
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,140
Hey, mom.

580
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:53,370

581
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,970
AUDIENCE: So we have a service
that sends out event

582
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,160
recommendations to people, but
we've tried really hard to

583
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,630
make sure we don't overwhelm
people's inbox by bunching

584
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,220
those all together so
you get five or six

585
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,670
recommendations in one email.

586
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:06,340
Can we have more than one action
associated with an

587
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,900
email, or do we need to send
a single email for a single

588
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,720
entity that can have an
action against it?

589
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,410
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So right
now, what we're going to

590
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:17,690
launch is a single action,
but that can be related

591
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,780
to a group of things.

592
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,760
So the action, the single
call to action is

593
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,770
unique, one per email.

594
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,120
But the entity can be actually
a group of entities, or

595
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,260
multiple things.

596
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:33,200
Of course, the action then has
to either refer to one of them

597
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,270
or to all of them as a group.

598
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,890

599
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,410
AUDIENCE: You showed some
interesting examples of cards

600
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,410
that sound like they're mapping
to specific actions,

601
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,136
like rating or RSVPing.

602
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:49,000
What is the capacity for more
free-form customization to

603
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,580
build sort of our own more
customized type of forms that

604
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,460
may be presented
in that format?

605
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,760
SHALINI AGARWAL: So over
time, we'll be adding

606
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,655
more types of actions.

607
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:02,260
But right now, there's not &mdash;

608
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,550
the customization lies within
the box that you saw in terms

609
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,530
of for RSVP, can you say
yes, or no, or maybe?

610
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,360
Or what are the options?

611
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,060
And the reason for that is that
we want to make sure that

612
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,120
we provide a consistent
user experience.

613
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,910
Because if we allowed the UI to
be completely customized,

614
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,170
every email would
look different.

615
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,590
Every box would look
different.

616
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,050
And it would, again, be
difficult for users to figure

617
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,620
out what to do and
get things done.

618
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,610
But we definitely want to hear
about your use cases because

619
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,465
we do want to add more
types of actions.

620
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:30,840
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: I think the
bottom line there is that we

621
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,990
want to add more actions, and
we want to talk to you about

622
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,840
them, what you actually need.

623
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,050
But we need to find a fine
line between adding a new

624
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:44,672
auction and allowing everyone
to do anything.

625
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:45,995
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

626
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:47,500
AUDIENCE: Hi.

627
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,310
If outlook.com or Yahoo
Mail wanted to add

628
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,750
schemas, could they?

629
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,880
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You mean,
add to their emails?

630
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

631
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,180
So you could actually do the
same kind of things.

632
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,300
So if I write one email with
schemas, then it would work in

633
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,340
Outlook and in Yahoo Mail?

634
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,310
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So as I said,
this technology is open.

635
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,300
And we actually would like
them to support this.

636
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,010
AUDIENCE: So it is open?

637
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,150
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Yeah, it is open.

638
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,580
It's based on schema.org.

639
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,680
And we are in talk with
some other companies.

640
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,980
So some other big names know
about this already.

641
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,070
And then, of course,
it's up to them to

642
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,040
implement it or not.

643
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,850
AUDIENCE: Of course.

644
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,200
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: But
yeah, it's open.

645
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,160
That's a short answer.

646
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

647
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,430
What other applications, other
than Gmail, will these actions

648
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:39,220
become available in within the
Google product offerings?

649
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,120
For instance, Voice &mdash;

650
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,970
will it tie-in with
Google Voice.

651
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,140
Obviously, Google Now has access
to that information.

652
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,980
Are there other places we should
look for to be able to

653
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,360
[? provide ?]

654
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,610
cards?

655
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,430

656
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,070
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So right now,
this schema is supported

657
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,560
by Gmail, Search, and Now.

658
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:06,060
And not all of them support
the same entities

659
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,380
and the same actions.

660
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,380
So the first step for us would
be to have all of them support

661
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,990
the same entities and
same actions.

662
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,430
Of course, if that makes
sense for each client.

663
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:21,960
Another Google property that
uses schema is Google+.

664
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,330
So we're also standardizing
the entities we support

665
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,210
together with the
Google+ team.

666
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:34,690
And we realize that schema helps
the web, helps other

667
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,250
properties.

668
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:40,140
So we're adding schema support
to properties that you know.

669
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,440
That makes sense.

670
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,710
So far, we have identified
these four.

671
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,730
So Gmail, Search, Now, and +.

672
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,260
But if it makes sense for other
properties to support

673
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,830
schema, we'll be really
happy to do it.

674
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,220
And everyone at Google
will be.

675
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,010
AUDIENCE: I guess my
for-instance would be the

676
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:02,110
ability for not only Gmail to
be able to show a card, but

677
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,590
for other applications within
Google to be able to take the

678
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,850
same action.

679
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,800
I understand the schemas
generally could

680
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,230
be parsed by anything.

681
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,110
But from an action execution
standpoint, you're saying

682
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,420
that's still underway
or not necessary?

683
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,010
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah,
it's underway.

684
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,390
We're definitely thinking about
adding actions to other

685
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:23,990
properties.

686
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:29,890
One, let's say, implementation
detail, is that we have &mdash;

687
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,970
we share the parsing technology

688
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,020
at Google, of course.

689
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,545
So it's easier for other
properties to use.

690
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:37,395
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

691
00:32:37,395 --> 00:32:39,720
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Thank you.

692
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,401
AUDIENCE: Hi.

693
00:32:41,401 --> 00:32:46,120
In your example, say, where
you reviewed a restaurant.

694
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,720
And at the end of it, you're
done, but the email's still in

695
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,510
your inbox.

696
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:56,620
Is that going to be archived
automatically at some point.?

697
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,620
SHALINI AGARWAL: So right now
what happens is that once you

698
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,370
complete the action, the email
is marked as read.

699
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,050
We do not auto archive the
email at the moment.

700
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,070
If we see that as a strong
user request,

701
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,625
we'll think about it.

702
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,900
But right now as we roll this
out, we want to be sure that

703
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,410
users understand what's
happening.

704
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:15,804
So that's not going to
happen right now.

705
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:16,240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

706
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,640
I saw screenshots of the
list view and I saw

707
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,210
card in a body view.

708
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,940
But do the other buttons
appear in the

709
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,620
body view as well?

710
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,700
So for example, like
do the review?

711
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,090
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You mean
when the email is open?

712
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,130
AUDIENCE: Yes.

713
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,420
SHALINI AGARWAL: So all in-app
actions will appear in the

714
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,280
body view as well.

715
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,100
So the one-click action
will appear.

716
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,270
And rate and review has the
nice card, just like the

717
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,030
flights does.

718
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,650
RSVP has a nice card, just
like the flights does.

719
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:42,990
AUDIENCE: Got it.

720
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,260
Thanks.

721
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,050
Sorry, one other question.

722
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,530
The goto action button, building
on the previous

723
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:51,460
question, does it show
completed, even if you have to

724
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,850
go to an external website
to complete the action?

725
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,020
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: The goto
action doesn't really have a

726
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,010
completed state.

727
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,690
So it doesn't really change.

728
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:01,940
AUDIENCE: All right.

729
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,520
Great.

730
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,210
Thank you.

731
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

732
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,800
For the developers that are
building on top of Gmail, like

733
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,780
third-party clients, how can we
make sure that these emails

734
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,960
are actually useful
to the user?

735
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,460
And do you have any help for
the developers to implement

736
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,690
the same type of actions
depending on the schemas?

737
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,240
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Well, one
thing is that the vocabulary,

738
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,000
the schema is public.

739
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,350
So in the documentation,
we explicitly say

740
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,030
which types we support.

741
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,780
And all the additions we added,
like all the new things

742
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,530
we added to the schema, are
being added to schema.org so

743
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,239
the public vocabulary, Or at
least are being considered by

744
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,489
schema.org.

745
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:53,260

746
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,969
On a third-party side to support
this only takes &mdash;

747
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,230
well, what it takes is
constructing the markup and

748
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,960
supporting those
specific types.

749
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,436
Then, the rendering &mdash;

750
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:05,830
AUDIENCE: Yeah, do you have any
specific guidelines for

751
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:10,480
how it should be rendered and
how it should behave?

752
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,710
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: I would
say not really.

753
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,490
Because what we want is that
the user interface is

754
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,740
consistent within the client.

755
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,735
So for Gmail, of course,
we know how

756
00:35:18,735 --> 00:35:19,460
that should look like.

757
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,610
But another client, like the
same drop down we use for

758
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,660
Gmail might not be
the best UI.

759
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:30,020
So we will not ask you to
implement any specific UI.

760
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,340
And the only recommendation,
which is like a standard

761
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,550
recommendation, is to make sure
that that provides the

762
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,020
best user experience
and matches the

763
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,680
consistent user interface.

764
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,560
AUDIENCE: If we have
like any &mdash;

765
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,220
is there a developer support
group that we can talk from

766
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,980
the client side, not from
the sender side?

767
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,670
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You
mean as a user

768
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,560
that gets these actions?

769
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

770
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,490
Well, for the third-party
developers who are building

771
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,860
email clients on top of Gmail.

772
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,470
How can we get help from you?

773
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,820
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So we
have a page in the docs

774
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,690
that also says that.

775
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:10,620
But as we're doing with many
other products at Google, we

776
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,680
decided to support developers
where they already are, which

777
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,650
is Stack Overflow.

778
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,700
So we are there.

779
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:21,030
And another thing that I always
advise is &mdash; that is my

780
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,400
Google+ handle.

781
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,790
Reach out to me directly.

782
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,780
I'll be really happy
to talk to you &mdash;

783
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,870
all developers.

784
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,640
And I'll point you to the
correct resource.

785
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,890
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

786
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,820

787
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,060
AUDIENCE: This is a
quick question.

788
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,920
I was just wondering if you guys
are looking at bringing

789
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,520
this to the mobile interfaces.

790
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,060
So these actions on iOS
and the Android apps?

791
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,350
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

792
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,450
So we are working on mobile
as well, but it'll

793
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,953
take time to get out.

794
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:49,700
AUDIENCE: OK.

795
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,720
SHALINI AGARWAL: I agree that
it's very useful on mobile.

796
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,270

797
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,410
AUDIENCE: How do you manage the
authentication because all

798
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,490
the action comes in the
email that can be

799
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:04,690
forwarded or anything.

800
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:09,160
How do you identify that the
email you sent is &mdash; the action

801
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,030
is completed by the
person that you

802
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,620
intended to do the action?

803
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,950
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So we require
emails to be signed

804
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,090
[INAUDIBLE].

805
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,410
To be signed so that we know who
the sender is and we can

806
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,430
guarantee that the sender is who
the sender pretends to be

807
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,630
or says he is.

808
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,290
And at launch, what we're doing
right now is that we

809
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,300
have a white list.

810
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,710
So you, as a developer, in order
for your markup to be

811
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,510
showed to all users, will have
to be added to the white list.

812
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,730
So we will have you to
talk to us, tell us

813
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,380
about your use case.

814
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,650
Show us what you'll do.

815
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,990
We'll add you to
the white list.

816
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,570
Then we know who you are.

817
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,020
You sign your emails and that
proves that you are who you

818
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,863
say you are.

819
00:37:52,863 --> 00:37:53,226
AUDIENCE: OK.

820
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:55,070
Just one other question.

821
00:37:55,070 --> 00:38:00,032
Are you considering more complex
actions, like a kind

822
00:38:00,032 --> 00:38:03,300
of rating, but for e-commerce?

823
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,550
When you write that you bought
something, but in the action

824
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:12,270
maybe you are confirming that
you bought that item and that

825
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,340
causes a charge to be billed
to the seller.

826
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,800
And sometimes you can write
positive only if

827
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,160
you bought the item.

828
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,980
Some logic inside the action,
are you considering

829
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,870
[INAUDIBLE]?

830
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,410
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Not at
this moment I would say.

831
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,320
But yeah, that's another
use case we would

832
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,380
like to talk about.

833
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,410
Let's talk about it later
if you're still around.

834
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,810
Thank you.

835
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,570
AUDIENCE: Sort of related to the
last two questions about

836
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:45,120
lack of mobile and another
need for degradation.

837
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,980
If the recipient is not in a
supported mode or the sender's

838
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,510
not authenticated, is the
degradation just that the

839
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,570
actions don't show?

840
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,185
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

841
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:56,630
So essentially we're
just being ignored.

842
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,255
AUDIENCE: And then another
question is, does that affect

843
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:02,410
the SMTP envelope
contents at all?

844
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,940
For like enterprise use, none
of this is going to be

845
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,600
archived as part of the
email itself, right?

846
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,410
Or yes?

847
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,020
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Doesn't
affect anything?

848
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,760
It's part of the HTML body.

849
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,410
So it's extra markup
in the HTML body.

850
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:22,750
Unless there's some other part
where that is stripped, or

851
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,490
prevented, or blocked,
or anything.

852
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,700
We don't do anything
to prevent that.

853
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,220
It shouldn't affect it.

854
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,380
SHALINI AGARWAL: It should get
delivered like any other

855
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,880
message at that point.

856
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,760
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

857
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,040
AUDIENCE: Recently, you added
a feature in Gmail where you

858
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,440
can add to Calendar.

859
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,690
Does that use you schemas?

860
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,710

861
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,210
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So there
are two things there.

862
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,375
The Add to Calendar or the
integration with Calendar that

863
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,340
you saw today and you will
see in the next days

864
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,780
are based on schema.

865
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,680
That part also uses some
intelligence data.

866
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,440
I mean, I think what you're
talking about is the feature

867
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,320
where Gmail, in the sense you're
talking about a date or

868
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,640
an event, right?

869
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,430
So that is actually based on
some other machine learning

870
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:11,590
things where we try to
understand that that email is

871
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,485
about an event invitation &mdash;

872
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:12,780
AUDIENCE: Got you.

873
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,460
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
If we get that.

874
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,300
Because that is not really
in the email.

875
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,410
That can be triggered by me
sending an email to you with

876
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,430
no markup and saying, hey, can
we go have a beer tomorrow?

877
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,160
AUDIENCE: That's
what I thought.

878
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,200
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So yeah,
Gmail will understand that

879
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,080
with machine learning
technology.

880
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

881
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,015
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Thank you.

882
00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:31,490
SHALINI AGARWAL: Great.

883
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,915
I think we have another
question.

884
00:40:32,915 --> 00:40:37,200

885
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,940
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

886
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,380
There's Gmail Gadgets.

887
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,230
I was wondering if you were
thinking of, in the future of

888
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,770
implementing a way
to launch a Gmail

889
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,690
Gadget from these actions?

890
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,880
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: I
don't think we have

891
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,120
any plans to do that.

892
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,780
SHALINI AGARWAL: You're talking
about the gadgets on

893
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,080
the right-hand side of Gmail?

894
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,040
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Sidebar
gadgets or contextual gadgets?

895
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,950
AUDIENCE: No, the
Gmail Gadget.

896
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,760
There's both.

897
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,200
There's the full pain view
that you can get and then

898
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,560
there's also sidebar gadgets.

899
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,700
I was wondering if there
was a way to interact?

900
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,590
SHALINI AGARWAL: Right now
there's no plans to do that.

901
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,700
But tell us about what you'd
like to do and we can always &mdash;

902
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,255
AUDIENCE: Widgets, sorry.

903
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:12,070
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, OK.

904
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,260
Yeah, no plans.

905
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,300
If there is a specific use case
you have in mind, let us

906
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,870
know, please.

907
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,280
Thank you.

908
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,660
SHALINI AGARWAL: All right,
I think we're out of time.

909
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,630
So thank you very much.

910
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,273
[APPLAUSE]
