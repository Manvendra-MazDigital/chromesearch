1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,968

2
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:09,360
ALI AFSHAR: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,240
Welcome to Google
Developers Live.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,075
My name's Ali.

5
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:13,030
STEVE BAZYL: And I'm Steve.

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,630
ALI AFSHAR: And today we're
going to be talking to you

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,570
about all the exciting
things going on at

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,750
Google I/O this year.

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,070
If you don't know Google I/O,
it's our main developer

10
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,030
conference, and we're really
excited about it.

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,510
So, if you want a quick overview
of what we're doing

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,000
at Google Drive, then make sure
you go to the Google I/O

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,480
website, which has the sessions
listed on there, and

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,370
you can see that now.

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,440
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, so if you
haven't checked that out yet,

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,710
I want to give you a couple
highlights of some of those

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,150
sessions that we're doing
related to Google Drive.

18
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,040
There's one which is a You're
On With Drive SDK.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,580
This is with Nicholas.

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,740
And he is just going to review
all the changes since last

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,130
year's I/O. There's been a lot
of developments with the SDK.

22
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,150
And for those who just want to
catch up, it's a great talk.

23
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,350
There will be a few others.

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,700
I'm doing one with Josh
Hudgens, who 's our PM

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,480
on the Drive SDK.

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,110
And we're going to talk about
some of the momentum that

27
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,040
we've seen over the last year,
the growth in drive apps, and

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,170
how you, as a developer, can
take advantage of that.

29
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,300
Brian and Cheryl, who were on
GDL a few weeks ago talking

30
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,520
about the real time API,
are going to do a deep

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,870
dive into that API.

32
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,950
It's actually a really good
talk for those who are

33
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,750
interested in how that
technology works.

34
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,860
Very technical.

35
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,360
Very interesting talk.

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,350
They're also going to do a code
lab on Friday, the last

37
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,950
day of I/O, where you can play
with the real time API and

38
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,490
learn how to build an app.

39
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,260
There are several talks on Apps
Scripts, and how Apps

40
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,120
Scripts integrates with
Google Drive.

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,410
You can do things like
automating Google Docs, and

42
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,970
also build drive apps using
the Apps Script APIs.

43
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,335
And Ali, I think you're doing
one on app data, right?

44
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:49,130
And Android development.

45
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,372
ALI AFSHAR: That's right.

46
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:51,730
Plug for my talk.

47
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,580
I think Drive's a really
great solution for

48
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,060
storing files on Android.

49
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,970
And we're going to talk about
the various ways you can do

50
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,280
that, and why you
should do that.

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,050
So, come along to that
talk as well.

52
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,420
Thanks, Steve.

53
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,870
STEVE BAZYL: And there are a few
more that will be on the

54
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,580
schedule as I/O appears
to get closer.

55
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,060
But those are being kept
a little quiet for now.

56
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,930
But check them out.

57
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,200
Really exciting stuff coming.

58
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,810
And, of course, you can always
come and watch the sessions.

59
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,870
You're encouraged to.

60
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,700
If you happen to miss one of
them, but you want to ask

61
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,780
questions, you can stop
by the Office Hours.

62
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,280
After each talk, the speakers
are going to be there.

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,040
And you can come and get more
information, or ask questions,

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,000
for whatever you need.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,620
ALI AFSHAR: Yeah, and we love
talking to you guys.

66
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,230
So, please come along.

67
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,240
You can't stop us from talking
about programming, and the

68
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,420
various things involved
with Google Drive.

69
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,900
So, please, please just come
along there and see us.

70
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,830
Now, if you haven't got
a ticket, don't worry.

71
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,410
There are many ways you can
still get involved.

72
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,590
We have Google I/O Extended.

73
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,830
Now, that's hundreds of places
where people have organized to

74
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,700
have events around I/O. So, if
you have one local to you,

75
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,800
then please get involved
there.

76
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,890
You can see the map
of all the places.

77
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,480
And, again, that's on our
Google I/O website.

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,650
STEVE BAZYL: And people are
watching these live, right?

79
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,976
So people in Sydney, you're
going to be watching at two or

80
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:09,700
three in the morning.

81
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,270
ALI AFSHAR: Yeah, it's a
pretty fun occasion.

82
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,010
So if you can get involved
there, I certainly would.

83
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,900
And, again, even if you can't
make that, don't worry.

84
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,800
We're recording all
these sessions.

85
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,550
And we're live streaming a
number of them, as well, on

86
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,630
Google Developers Live.

87
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,390
So, if you come here while
you're watching this site, you

88
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,680
can see all the sessions
that you miss.

89
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,000
Even if you go to the conference
and you miss some

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,805
sessions because of conflicts,
you can always catch up there.

91
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:37,810
STEVE BAZYL: And if you are
going to be at I/O, I

92
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,230
definitely encourage
you to check out

93
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,570
the Developer Sandbox.

94
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,810
This is near the Office
Hours, as well.

95
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,460
And there will be 24 different
developers who have built apps

96
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,690
around Google Apps, including
Drive, and Apps Script, and a

97
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,230
few other APIs.

98
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,380
And check these out.

99
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,550
The list of developers that will
be on there is going to

100
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,340
be available later today.

101
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,770
I don't want to spoil the
surprise too much.

102
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,140
But there's some really
cool apps in there.

103
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,770
These people are building really
innovative things.

104
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,210
We have a broad set from desktop
applications, to

105
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,500
hardware, to web apps, some
really interesting

106
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,820
integrations with Apps Script.

107
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,090
And these are all developers.

108
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,060
So you come by, ask them about
their implementation.

109
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,110
They can answer questions.

110
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,420
Give you some advice on how
to make your applications

111
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,490
integrate really nice.

112
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,550
ALI AFSHAR: Yeah, and
also ask them why.

113
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,130
What did Google Drive
integration for their apps,

114
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,460
what did that do for
their business?

115
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,790
Because that's really
important.

116
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,040
We want you to make money.

117
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,600
And these are people who are
making good money out of

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,970
having Google Drive
integration.

119
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,590
So, come along and say
hello to them.

120
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,670
And lastly, some fun stuff.

121
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,650
So, of course, we'll be having
the usual set of tastefully

122
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,700
branded merchandise with
the Google Drive logo.

123
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,450
So, come along and get that, if
you come and see us in the

124
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,700
Sandbox or the Office Hours.

125
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,027
And in addition to that this
year, we're having prizes for

126
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:58,190
posts to the community.

127
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,570
So, every day at I/O, we'll be
giving a special prize to one

128
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,320
post from someone who's at I/O.
And if you're not at I/O,

129
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,870
don't worry.

130
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,340
You can still win a prize for
a post to the community from

131
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,600
someone who's not at I/O.

132
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,910
So, make a post.

133
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,310
Make it the most interesting
thing you can--

134
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,290
something you learned, something
you'd like to know.

135
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,840
We'll be giving a prize out
for the best one of these.

136
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,710
Just tag your post with Drive
I/O hashtag, and everything

137
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,890
else will fall into place.

138
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,110
So, come, win those prizes.

139
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,560
We're really excited
to see you there.

140
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,630
STEVE BAZYL: Yep, it's going
to be a great time.

141
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,380
We're really looking
forward to it.

142
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,800
And if you're going to be there,
definitely stop by and

143
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,540
say hello to us at
the Office Hours.

144
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,890
Stop by the sessions.

145
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,510
And check out the developers
in the Sandbox And, of

146
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,650
course, have fun.

147
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,630
ALI AFSHAR: Yeah, awesome.

148
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,780
Definitely have fun.

149
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,725
Enjoy yourselves at I/O.
So, we'll see you

150
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:47,580
there, if you're coming.

151
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,190
If not, hopefully next year.

152
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,176
STEVE BAZYL: Thank you.

153
00:05:50,176 --> 00:05:51,426
ALI AFSHAR: Thanks all.

154
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:59,073
