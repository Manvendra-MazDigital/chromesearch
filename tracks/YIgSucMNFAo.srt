00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,060

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello and welcome to another
episode of GDL Israel Google

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,750
Developer Live.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,610
We are going to touch, today, on
a few interesting subjects.

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,470
First, we're going to see how
easy it is to build today a

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,880
mobile web app that will work
actually quite nice on all the

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,940
different mobile devices that
you can find out there.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,560
And we'll see how, with Google
Docs, and specifically Google

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,950
Spreadsheets and upscript, we
could create some nice server

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,560
side and actually share it with
other people that will be

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,110
responsible for updating
our content.

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,520
So we'll get actually two
birds with one stone.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,090
We'll create the server
environment without any coding

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,740
quite quickly.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,730
We'll be able to put it up in
the air and share and control

16
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,500
the permission and everything
because, of course, it's

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,740
coming for free when you
are using Google Docs.

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,750
But moreover, it's a very nice
and easy way for us to share

19
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,950
the content and to be able to
drive the mobile app through

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,280
this server side.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,330
The one nice thing that you
could do with it is to use the

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,185
upscript, which is the
JavaScript glue, if you will,

23
00:01:18,185 --> 00:01:19,790
to all Google products.

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,880
And this will let you not only
automate a few of the tasks,

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,090
but actually get a grasp of what
you could do with this

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,400
application.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,540
And in our case, I just choose
to do something nice with

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,080
Google Maps API since from
version 3.0 it's optimized for

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,290
mobile and will work quite
nicely on all mobile devices

30
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,860
and much faster.

31
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,460
So without further ado, let me
just share my screen with you.

32
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,160
And we'll go through these few
slides with lots of demos.

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,900
So all these slides will be, of
course, up in the air on my

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,150
blog at greenido.wordpress.com.

35
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,940

36
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,330
And of course, you have a link
here to the shows that we have

37
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,260
every Wednesday at 2:00
PM Israel time.

38
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,430
So if you want to touch and ask
questions in the end of

39
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,130
the show, feel free.

40
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,990
If you want to reach out to me,
both on G+ and Twitter, it

41
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,270
will be greenido.

42
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,450
And let me make it
even bigger.

43
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,250
And of course, you could just go
to the blog itself and see

44
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,990
a summary of this talk and
all the show notes.

45
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,030
So what we are going to do
today, we are going to look at

46
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,010
the mobile web app that I
did in the past 10 days.

47
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,580
And we'll see some of the best
practices that you want to

48
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,880
start and use when you're
building your own mobile web

49
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,680
page, site, or app.

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,450
And of course, in this case,
we'll just use our server side

51
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,150
in Google Sheets and,
of course, bundled

52
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,290
in them, App Script.

53
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,060
We're leveraging, of course, the
latest and greatest API in

54
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,840
Google Maps.

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,330
And that, of course, will
guarantee that we are getting

56
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,350
good performances on
mobile devices.

57
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,670
So how does it look like?

58
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,700
Well, it's in Hebrew.

59
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,170
And that's actually
another aspect.

60
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,600
When you want to do things here
it's just a demo app.

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,482
So the route is in English, so
people could play around it.

62
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:17,570
But internalization and
localization is something that

63
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,860
you do want to pay attention,
especially when you're

64
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,980
building mobile apps,
mobile web apps,

65
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,660
and of course, sites.

66
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,470
A lots of users are coming
from different countries.

67
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,410
And you want to be able to make
them feel at home with

68
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,520
their own language.

69
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,560
If you want to see some of the
best practices in design,

70
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,560
development, debugging, and how,
basically, to work with

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,020
the mobile web, there's a nice
slides in this link that will

72
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,180
take you to all the
best practices.

73
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,180
And of course, if you want to
see another dedicated talk

74
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,030
that I did with Riley a bit
earlier this year that, again,

75
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,670
just focusing on the mobile web,
this is the link as well.

76
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,950
Why I choose jQuery to build
this mobile on top of?

77
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,210
Because I see jQuery Mobile as
CSS frameworks that basically

78
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,590
save us lots of effort.

79
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,990
They did a lot of work in
testing and making sure that

80
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,290
our site or app will look good
on all different mobile

81
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,730
devices out there.

82
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,010
And of course, it's an HTML file
based UI that is built on

83
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,380
top jQuery and jQuery UI, so
you're getting lots of

84
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,540
development hours already
baked in for you.

85
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,110
And basically, you are standing
on the shoulders of

86
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,320
giants, if you will.

87
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,250
And saving you lots of work.

88
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,540
This is how our app look like.

89
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,420
And let's see a quick demo
of the app itself.

90
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,690
So this is a live link, of
course, as you could see.

91
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,070
And now, I just downloaded
the app itself.

92
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,280
And you could see here a
few interesting things.

93
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,570
If I'll open Chrome dev tools,
let's see if we could change

94
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,375
the app itself.

95
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,240
And I'll make it bigger,
so everyone could see.

96
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,420
Let's see how this app look
like on Android Nexus.

97
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,340
So you see immediately
that I got the device

98
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,250
metric here for me.

99
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,460
And this is more or less
how it will look like.

100
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,320
If I'm enforcing it, you could
see now that I don't have here

101
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,020
the text, but I have
three dots.

102
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,950
And that's, of course, coming
for free when I'm using this

103
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,320
CSS framework.

104
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,020
And you could see that
all text is actually

105
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,000
in the right place.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,600
And the buttons are
still functional.

107
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,690
By the way, those buttons will
open the [INAUDIBLE] mobile

108
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,530
app of Waze if you are getting
this mobile web app about from

109
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,620
a mobile device.

110
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,620
And I'll show you in a
minute how to do it.

111
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,080
And it's actually a great
features for your users

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,480
because they don't need to click
on a link and then copy

113
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,500
it or do something
tedious with it.

114
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,340
You just give them one button.

115
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,140
And from this one button, they
will get the directions to the

116
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,790
place that they need to go.

117
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,430
At the bottom of the page, we
have a full-blown Google map.

118
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,620
We could zoom in.

119
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,050
We could open and get more
information on the markers.

120
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,000
And some nice buttons to the
official page if users want to

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,820
go and see it.

122
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,040
Simple things like encapsulating
everything in

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,920
the real estate that you
have for your app.

124
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,630
And making sure that you have
this notion of pages of

125
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,400
flipping and coming to life.

126
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,030
Again, very, very easy to do.

127
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,790
Let's now just have a quick look
at our code and see what

128
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,910
are the main aspects.

129
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,990
So I'll open source.

130
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,760
And here I'll just go
to our index file.

131
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,070
And one of the things that you
could see here is that in the

132
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,750
metatag I'm making sure that if
the user is coming from IE,

133
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,060
just to open a prompt frame.

134
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,540
I'm making sure that the view
port will stay and the initial

135
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,620
scale will be one.

136
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:08,240
And you could see more of why
we're doing it in the link

137
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,960
that I put on the first slide.

138
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,355
And then just touching our CSS
here, the JavaScript, of

139
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:15,580
course, will come at the
end of the page.

140
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,340
And the CSS important, in this
case, because we want to use

141
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,550
the special CSS rules that
they already got for us.

142
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,980
Here, we're using the
jQuery, of course,

143
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,690
and the jQuery mobile.

144
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,880
And we're using both of them
right here, so the app itself

145
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,620
will load and do all the
interesting stuff of styling

146
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,000
driven from jQuery
mobile itself.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,740
We're using Modernizer just make
sure that we do the right

148
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,550
things on different browsers &mdash;
a bit older browsers.

149
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,880
And here we're just loading
the Google Map API.

150
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,880
After that, we have
our own script.

151
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,530
And actually as a best practice,
and as a nice to do

152
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,990
here, we need the styling to
put in another file, of

153
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,330
course, and separate HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

154
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,250
Here, we have these
organizational pages.

155
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,995
So the first page just includes
here this table that

156
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:13,650
is actually a nice grid that
we're getting for free again.

157
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,880
And we're just filling this grid
with our JavaScript API.

158
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,220
And after that, we're just using
the map, as you could

159
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,540
see here, and making sure that
we are painting the map itself

160
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,340
on our map canvas and putting
the right markers in place.

161
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,150
Let's see a bit of
the JavaScript

162
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,120
code that does this.

163
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,220
So on the map itself, of course,
we want to take these

164
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,690
and put them under one object
and remove them from the

165
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,370
global scope.

166
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,740
But here is just a little bit
of boilerplate code to

167
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,170
initialize the map.

168
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,050
And after we're doing that, this
is the interesting part.

169
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,960
And let's just make
it a bit bigger.

170
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,140
So what we're doing here is
basically we're going to our

171
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,760
spreadsheet URL.

172
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,670
And in each and every
spreadsheet URL that you have

173
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,640
in Google you have the ability
to publish it as

174
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,943
a feed to the web.

175
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:06,080
And in our case, I choose,
of course, to publish

176
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,800
it as an RSS feed.

177
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,580
And then the nice tweak in the
end is just to put here alt

178
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,800
equals JSON instead of RSS.

179
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,440
And you're getting it
as a JSON object.

180
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,910
And then, all we to do is just
to get the JSON object.

181
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,960
As you can see here, we're
getting the feed and we're

182
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,220
getting the data.

183
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,780
And then it's just a matter of
a bit massaging the data and

184
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,280
making sure that we're
extracting the right things

185
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,390
and building the main table
in this one append.

186
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,770
And you could see here the
results of this table.

187
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,250
There's nothing more
than that.

188
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,980
Later on, we're doing some
nice tricks like the map

189
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,880
should fit the bounds
of the markers.

190
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,050
So we're just calling this.

191
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,620
And again, with the great Google
Maps version 3.0 API

192
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,670
we're getting those
things for free.

193
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,515
And of course, we're refreshing
the buttons that

194
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:56,140
will take us.

195
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,660
This is how we're adding
a marker to the map.

196
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,460
And an info window, the info
window are those windows that

197
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,550
when we're clicking on them,
that's what you're getting.

198
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,030
That's the code itself, very,
very simple and quite

199
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,520
straightforward.

200
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,730
And as you could see here, when
our page is ready in the

201
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,480
mobile world, all we're doing is
calling the initialization

202
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,960
of the map and then fetching
the points from our server

203
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,835
side, which is a Google
spreadsheet.

204
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:30,390

205
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,330
Why I use this server side?

206
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:40,100
Well, it's an easy CMS, a
content management system,

207
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,745
that's giving you great
capabilities without and

208
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:46,763
coding and without worrying to
security and other things that

209
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:50,900
you'll have to do if you want
to put something in the air.

210
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,360
Not to mention that in terms of
scale and performances it's

211
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,410
very, very nice to have it.

212
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,160
Last, but not least,
is our API.

213
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,900
So the APIs are quite generous
in the sense that we could

214
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:08,480
export those feeds and get it as
an XML, csv, RSS, Atom, and

215
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,510
more and more.

216
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,310
And you could read more about it
and how you could work with

217
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:17,300
it and actually how to do some
clever things with the data

218
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,070
that you have on this
link at the bottom.

219
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:28,370
Google Map API, we just covered
basic and very simple

220
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,270
code that we're using.

221
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,070
But in this link here I just put
you a shortcut to all of

222
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,750
the various examples that you
have to work with Google Maps.

223
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,080
And I highly encourage you just
to check them out because

224
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,920
they are very simple and very
powerful both if you are going

225
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,510
to do a native app or
a mobile web app.

226
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,830
The nice thing about the Waze
web API is that it's nothing

227
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,110
more than a link.

228
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,750
And you could see here, if I'm
just going and doing inspect

229
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,090
element on it, what
we have here is

230
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,820
basically just a button.

231
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,485
And then the link to it &mdash;

232
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:09,760

233
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,600
As you could see here, this is
just the link that will make

234
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,480
our mobile web browser to open
the Waze native app and set

235
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,220
the point to this
geo location.

236
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,470
So all you need to do is
basically just create this

237
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,950
shortcut link of Waze dot two.

238
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,480
And they're just giving it the
points that you want to do.

239
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,350
Very, very simple and

240
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,630
straightforward and very useful.

241
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,680
If there's any question and
answer, this is a great time

242
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,420
to ask them.

243
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,480
If not, be strong
until next time.

244
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,950
And just feel free to reach
out to me on Google+ with

245
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,810

246
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,190
So thank you very much
and bye-bye.

247
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:06,390
