00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,930
Hello, and welcome to another
episode of GDL-IL &mdash;

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,210
GDL Israel.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,270
Today we're going to go over
real briefly on several

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,220
updates and news that I gather,
and I'll try to share

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,210
with you some of the useful
links that I'm

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,875
using day in, day out.

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:32,110
We had this week here in Campus
Tel Aviv, a great event

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,400
on Google Cloud and all the new
features, services, and

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,680
new APIs that you
could leverage.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,500
And I'll put in the show notes
the links to one other

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,710
recording from this event, and
second, the presentation, so

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,840
even if you missed it, you
will be able to check the

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,190
videos, and of course,
go with the slides.

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,430
So without further ado, let me
just share my screen with you

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,470
and let's jump right in.

17
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,380
This is a place where I'm trying
to gather old and new

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,030
cool things that are happening
in Chrome platform, in Chrome

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,095
environment.

20
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:14,580
Now for those of you that are
not aware, today Chrome is

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,735
quite a huge platform.

22
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:20,170
It's not only the browser, which
is very, very popular

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,600
and conquering more and more
users every day, it's Chrome,

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,120
Chrome on Mobile, of course
Chrome on Android, Chrome on

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,590
iOS, Chrome in Google TV, and
of course, Chrome in all

26
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,540
[INAUDIBLE]

27
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,590
laptop, desktop, mobile
devices, and tablets.

28
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,250
So from four inch screen size up
to 70 or 90 inch TV, you've

29
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,540
got Chrome there
as a platform.

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,550
Not to mention Chrome OS with
all the great new devices,

31
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,800
like the Pixel and the
Chromebook and the ChromeVox

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,650
that letting you enjoy this
powerful ecosystem.

33
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,880
So this is the site.

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,690
I'll try just to put it maybe a
bit bigger here, so for the

35
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,330
ones of you that watch
it afterwards &mdash;

36
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,780

37
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,350
let's just do that.

38
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,820
So this is the link.

39
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:18,150
And one of the very new, cool
things that I put here is some

40
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,830
summary of all Chrome
use that are

41
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,600
happening around the world.

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,790
And we just touch about
a few of them.

43
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,700
So first and foremost is this
great source that if you are

44
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,900
not aware of &mdash; it's Peter
Beverloo blog, and he's one of

45
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,240
the powerful, great guys out
there that is bringing to us

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,500
all the latest and greatest in
terms of what's going on in

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,910
Chromium Open Source Project.

48
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,270
So if you want to save yourself
the trouble of going

49
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,430
and do a commitdiff and trying
to check and see what are all

50
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,390
the thousands of contributors
or hundreds of contributors

51
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,780
are doing inside Blink,
Chromium, et cetera.

52
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,690
Peter is bringing us almost on
a weekly basis all the latest

53
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,930
and greatest in terms of news,
and as you can see here, there

54
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,030
are some very, very
nice things.

55
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,920
Some are really important, like
we going to have now a

56
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,050
new, fancy dinosaur on all the
offline page in Chrome.

57
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,780
Let me make it bigger so
it will be better.

58
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,230
Yes.

59
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,530
So this is a very important
one, of course.

60
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,100
But there are some real
important features that you

61
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,460
might want to check and see how
they are influencing your

62
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:37,510
mobile web app or your desktop
next development or project.

63
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,780
So this is one source &mdash;

64
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,030
Peter.sh.

65
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,502

66
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:46,410
Let me put it a bit bigger here
so you could all see it

67
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,800
later on nicely as well.

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
So this is the site.

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:58,120
Definitely register to his RSS
feed or just check out the

70
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,420
blog from time to time, because
you get a great, great

71
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,440
summary of what's going on
inside the Chrome kingdom.

72
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,970
Another great source, that
basically it's just a few

73
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,750
other links over here, is
Chrome Release blog.

74
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,300
So I got this week few questions
from developers &mdash;

75
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,300
how can I be updated about
new channels that are

76
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,850
being pushed live?

77
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,280
And as you all know, Chrome is
being updated every six weeks.

78
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,470
And in this Google Chrome
Releases blog &mdash;

79
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,460
this is the URL, of course &mdash;

80
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,740
you could just keep yourself
updated on all the new things

81
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,100
that are happening and
are going out there.

82
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,070
It could be the dev channel
[INAUDIBLE], it could be the

83
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,120
beta, it could be their release
candidate, and of

84
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,010
course, the final versions
of Chrome.

85
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,430
And one of the nice things here
is that you could also

86
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,410
register yourself to
certain labels.

87
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,360
So if you, let's say, interested
in Chrome for iOS

88
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,010
or Chrome Better Version,
because you want to test

89
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,680
things automatically before they
are being pushed to their

90
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,650
final version, you could just
go, and as you see here, very

91
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,020
easily go on a specific label
and just keep yourself update

92
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,650
with this specific
type of Chrome.

93
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,950
Other useful links are here.

94
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,700
The official Chromium blog and
Chrome blog, of course, and

95
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,220
for those of you that are active
on G+, you probably

96
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,830
want to follow Chrome on G+.

97
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,860
Another great source that
I found from time

98
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,360
to time quite helpful &mdash;

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,280
it's an unofficial source, but
nevertheless, it's bringing

100
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,070
some new, exciting things
into your place &mdash;

101
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,640
is just this blog which called
Google System Blog post.

102
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,290
Again, it's unofficial blog, but
from time to time, I find

103
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,540
myself checking out what's going
on here, and they're

104
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,850
pretty good at catching and
updating what's going on in

105
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,100
Google ecosystem.

106
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,550

107
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,960
In terms of what happening in
the past month &mdash; so I had this

108
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,700
really cool event about startups
and the slides are

109
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,030
here, so you are most welcome
to check them out.

110
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:12,420
Except that we did several very
interesting GDLs in July.

111
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,080
If you want to test the water
and see what is Compute Engine

112
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,060
and what is all about, please go
ahead and check this link.

113
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,680
Let's open it and see.

114
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,670
So this is basically a short
tutorial that I put and it's

115
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,970
part, of course, of GDL-IL
series, which lets you test

116
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,800
the water if you will.

117
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,690
On Compute Engine,
quite quickly &mdash;

118
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,290
it's written here
five minutes.

119
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,460
I guess that for some of you,
it will take even less.

120
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,280
If you're taking out all the
manual process of putting the

121
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,150
billing in place, then very
quickly you could launch your

122
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,190
own virtual Box.

123
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,730
It might be CentOS, might be
Debian, and quite quickly you

124
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,980
could work and be productive
on it.

125
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,810
Some very, very interesting
things &mdash;

126
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,370
here are all the five easy steps
that you need to follow.

127
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,380
And another very important
link that I would love to

128
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,638
share with you is the
cloud.google.com.

129
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:15,000
Basically on this one URL, we're
trying to gather all the

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,460
vast, enormous actually,
offering in our Cloud

131
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,800
resources, products,
and solutions.

132
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,420
So quite quickly, if you're
going to this one link, you

133
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,740
could click on Products and
see all the different area

134
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,810
that you could utilize
and leverage.

135
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,875
And in our specific
case &mdash; let's jump

136
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,500
in to Compute Engine &mdash;

137
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,330
quite quickly you could see what
are the benefits, what

138
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,660
are the main features
that you gaining.

139
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,780
If you wish you compare it with
a current Cloud provider

140
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,700
or a current, let's say, private
Cloud that you are

141
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,860
using or any other different
solution, quite quickly here

142
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,330
you could find what will move
the needle for you and then

143
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,280
follow up on it and make sure
that this is the right tool

144
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,750
for the job.

145
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,770
One click here and you could
try it, and it's again

146
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,730
something very, very cool to
check out, specifically, if

147
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:10,810
you have cases where Google App
Engine is not support your

148
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,970
specific technology.

149
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,580
Without mentioning names, I met
big company that's still

150
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,260
using Perl in production, and
of course, Google App Engine

151
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,750
would be a good solution
for them.

152
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,195
But they definitely wanted to
test and check Compute Engine

153
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:29,730
because their working with
Debian in production, and then

154
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,510
it might be a perfect
solution for them.

155
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,299
BigQuery &mdash;

156
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,860
it's another very interesting
big topic.

157
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,620
If you have terabytes of log or
any other big data that you

158
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,770
want to check, here in this
episode of GDL-IL, I just show

159
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,250
you how you could work with
BigQuery from JavaScript, and

160
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,280
most specifically from
Appscript, and be productive

161
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,825
with it and analyze your
enormous data.

162
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:02,690
It's quite amazing to see
BigQuery these days, because

163
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,760
in that specific example, we
showed how you are slicing and

164
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,810
dicing more than 400 gigabytes
of data from HttpArchive and

165
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,220
basically getting for some real
interesting insights in

166
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,060
terms of trends on what
going on the leading

167
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,990
sites on the web.

168
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,475
So this is the place where you
want to check it, BigQuery

169
00:09:25,475 --> 00:09:29,400
Power With JavaScript, and quite
quickly here you could

170
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,490
see how easy it is to work with
simple SQL statements

171
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:40,430
like these that are returning in
less than a few seconds and

172
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,450
letting you have some
interesting thought and

173
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,390
results out of it.

174
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,620
In this specific example by the
way, we are going all over

175
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,730
Wikipedia and just seeing what
are the most popular topics,

176
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,430
articles basically, that's
being changed.

177
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,980
And here you can see the
leading of the table.

178
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,720
And this is the example that I
mentioned about HttpArchive

179
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,350
and how you could utilize
this specific

180
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,072
big data with BigQuery.

181
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,860
Last but not least is, of
course, what I mentioned &mdash;

182
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,440
yesterday, we had a big Cloud
event, and this is

183
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,090
the summary of it.

184
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,700
And you have here the slides and
of course more than three

185
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,300
hours of talks that you are most
welcome to just watch and

186
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,910
see what's interesting
for you.

187
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,910
So let's see, today as
I promised, we're

188
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,490
going to keep it short.

189
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,720
We have a few people
here that I see.

190
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,690
If someone have any questions,
now is a perfect time to ask,

191
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,780
and if not, just please feel
free to reach out on me on

192
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,260
GBlast, Twitter, or
any other channel.

193
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,900
Let me put here, again, just so
you could see what is the

194
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,050
best channels.

195
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,780
So on G+, of course, it will be
GreenIdo in one word, and

196
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,290
on Twitter, it will
be the same.

197
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,400
Just use whatever channel you
feel comfortable with.

198
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,980
And of course, we have here down
at the bottom a summary

199
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,610
of all the GDL Israel episodes
that we had in the past.

200
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,790
Quite a lot of really good
content here, so if you

201
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,830
interesting in design, in web
components, HTML5, Chrome,

202
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,900
Chrome OS, Angular, and more and
more, just feel free to go

203
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,670
here and check it out.

204
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:37,280
So until next time, thank you
very much for joining me.

205
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,380
And I hope that you'll have
a very productive week.

206
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,630
Bye bye.

207
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:52,852
