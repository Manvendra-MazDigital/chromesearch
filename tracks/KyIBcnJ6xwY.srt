1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,840
CHRIS CARDE: So hi everyone.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,880
I'd like to welcome you
all to this special

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,930
Google I/O tech talk.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,590
This is just one of very few
where we invite an external

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,950
partner to come in and talk
about what they're doing with

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,270
Google products.

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,370
So my name is Chris Carde.

9
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,960
I'm a Technical Program Manager
in our Munich office.

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,030
I work in our automotive team,
and our team focuses on

11
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,610
putting the right products and
APIs into the hands of car

12
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,020
makers to enable awesome
Google-powered navigation and

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,890
infotainment systems.

14
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,605
So we have a long history of
working with Mercedes.

15
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:33,310
It's been years now.

16
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,130
Back in 2008, they were one of
the first car companies to

17
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,050
launch Send to Car.

18
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,230
This is an integration from
Google Maps that allows users

19
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,630
to send destination businesses
directly from Google Maps to

20
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,620
their connected car.

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,980
They've continued to innovate
since then.

22
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,130
They've launched Google Local
Search and Street View built

23
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,210
into a number of their cars.

24
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,530
And actually, I believe just
yesterday, they announced the

25
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,060
new 2014 S Class with built-in
Google Maps.

26
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,540
So we're pretty excited about
Mercedes Drive, if you will,

27
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,750
to integrate connectivity and
Drive innovation, and that

28
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,560
brings us to today.

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,800
So Daimler came to us with
this new smartphone and

30
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,190
app-based platform.

31
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,620
They'll tell you a lot more
about it in their talk, but

32
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,470
what excites us is that
packaging these features into

33
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,850
a smartphone app really enables
them to innovate and

34
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,090
iterate at a pace that's
basically been unheard of in

35
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,290
automotive.

36
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,750
So we saw this great opportunity
to work with them

37
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,770
to help them bring connected
cars into the reality that our

38
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,140
Google Maps users have been
experiencing for years now,

39
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,420
and that's basically a fast,
predictive search for

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,100
businesses and addresses, and
a rich visualization of

41
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,600
results on a map.

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,980
So there are probably
two types of

43
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,760
people in the audience.

44
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,460
There are people here who build
cars, and then there are

45
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,130
people here who build
other things.

46
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,800
And I've talked a number
of people at the show.

47
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,420
It's probably the
people who build

48
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,770
cars are in the minority.

49
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,750
We've asked Mercedes to kind
of split the difference

50
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,250
because there's some interesting
stories they can

51
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,170
tell about automotive
challenges, but we'd also like

52
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,200
them to provide this broadly
applicable case study for how

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,850
they've taken the Google Maps
and Places APIs and built this

54
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,259
rich, beautiful product
of their own.

55
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,980
So without further delay, I'd
like to hand it over to Kal

56
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,140
Mos and Mike Cheng from
Mercedes, and they will tell

57
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,210
you about the digital
Drive style app.

58
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,800
KAL MOS: Thank you, Chris.

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,910
Hello, everyone.

60
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,470
Thanks a lot for coming
today to listen to us.

61
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,230
I will walk you through our
experience implementing Google

62
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,500
Places and the API, and I will
hand the microphone after that

63
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
to Mike Cheng, who is leading
the development on our team at

64
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,160
Mercedes Benz to dive deeper
into the code and talk about

65
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,000
some of his experiences
with the code.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,620
I work for Mercedes
Benz Research and

67
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,590
Development North America.

68
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,230
Our office is actually in
Palo Alto south of here.

69
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,160
And as Chris said, we've
been working with

70
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,060
Google for a while.

71
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,410
So actually, when you buy a
Mercedes Benz car today, it

72
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,060
comes equipped with some of
Google's services already.

73
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,720
The way it works today is that
we have an embedded head unit.

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,210
There is a head unit that is
already coming with the car.

75
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,660
HeadUnit is what you used to
call in the old days radio.

76
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,340
It's now a computer running
multiple different

77
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,320
features in the car.

78
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,660
We offer different Google
browser-based services within

79
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,540
that embedded HeadUnit.

80
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,080
And we get the connectivity
either via Bluetooth phone

81
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,110
paired to the car or via
embedded telephony in North

82
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,600
America using M-brace
system that we

83
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,770
have for safety features.

84
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,440
The features that are offered
usually in these cars, you get

85
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,720
Google Local Search, you get
Street View, you get Panorama

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,310
View, and if you are buying the
new S Class that was just

87
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,920
released yesterday, you get also
Google Maps and a full

88
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,720
implementation of Google Maps.

89
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,420
So we know that people come
to the car with their

90
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,610
smartphones, and there is always
a question of what

91
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,870
drivers actually want when they
get into the car with

92
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,120
their smartphone.

93
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,900

94
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,880
In most of the cars today, you
will be able to access your

95
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,550
contents from your phone.

96
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,410
So you have some private
contents, you have your music.

97
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,940
Can access your music,
for example.

98
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,120
You can access your
address book, you

99
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,870
can make phone calls.

100
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,550
But drivers want more.

101
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,780
And there is a study
that actually was

102
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,030
conducted by JD Power.

103
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,430
They actually went to drivers
who had navigation systems in

104
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,070
their car and asked them
what did they want?

105
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,310
And what they got back from
drivers is that they want an

106
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,790
easy and feature rich smartphone
integration.

107
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,630
So it's not just about contents
from the smartphone.

108
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,290
They want the features from
smartphone to be integrated,

109
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,030
and they want it to be easy,
and that's a key word here.

110
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,780
They want to use smartphone
for navigation.

111
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,040
So those are actually drivers,
not in Mercedes Benz cars, but

112
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,140
in all different cars.

113
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,890
47% of them downloaded a
navigation app and used it

114
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,035
while they had actually an
embedded navigation experience

115
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:17,950
in their cars.

116
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,880
So there is some kind of
growing preference for

117
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,370
navigation apps running
on smartphones.

118
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,390

119
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,710
And when the study dived deeper
into the reason for

120
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,530
that, they found that
destination input and

121
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,990
selection is a major pain
point for drivers.

122
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,350
And six out of the top 10
problems with the navigation

123
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,680
system they cited in that study
where actually related

124
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,810
to input and selection
of the destination.

125
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,320
The study concludes with
this statement.

126
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,290
One-shot destination
entry is the dream.

127
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,120
So that's what we have
out there from

128
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,890
that study by JD Power.

129
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,940
So we looked at what
we have internally.

130
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,960
We have a system that's running
on a smartphone.

131
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,460
The system is called
Digital DriveStyle.

132
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,820
It's an application, runs
on the smartphone.

133
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,370
And with that, once you run on
a smartphone, you get the

134
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,930
quick update cycle, which
basically you can virtually

135
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,450
release a new version of the
application every couple of

136
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,180
weeks if you want to.

137
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,450
And that helps us and offers us
an opportunity to continue

138
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,750
the innovation cycle
with that.

139
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,480
We can add features, we can
modify features, and we can

140
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,310
adjust the customer's
demand very quickly.

141
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,430
We also are able to harness the
power of the smartphone.

142
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,200
It's not a secret to anyone
here that smartphone is

143
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,290
leading in the hardware
and software areas

144
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,320
of innovations today.

145
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,270
They are running now very,
very powerful processors.

146
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,410
And as you probably can see
around us, outside this room,

147
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,980
lots of things are running
around the platforms itself

148
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,445
like Android platform,
for example.

149
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:09,980

150
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:16,425
So we brought all of these
advantages of smartphone and

151
00:07:16,425 --> 00:07:19,580
the ecosystem of smartphone
applications, and we run this

152
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,330
in the car.

153
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,880
So once you get into the
car, you connect your

154
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,780
phone to the car &mdash;

155
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,295
you actually use the
car displays.

156
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:31,220
You use a system like the audio
system in the car, the

157
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,720
speakers in the car, the
microphone in the car, the

158
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,980
input mechanism of the car.

159
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,580
So you don't touch the phone
once you get into the car.

160
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,500
The whole logic is coming
from the phone.

161
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,170
All the screens are actually
rendered on the phone, but you

162
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,825
don't do even feel that as you
are driving your car and

163
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:50,861
interacting with the system.

164
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:54,030
The specific application here,
the Digital DriveStyle that

165
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,570
you see, it has three main
categories of features.

166
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,960
It has Social, it has Media,
and it has Places.

167
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,440
Social basically gives you a
safe, non-distracting way to

168
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,520
access your social
media networks.

169
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,430
For example, you can access your
Facebook, you can access

170
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,620
your Twitter feed.

171
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,360
You can access also your
Google+, as we show actually

172
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,450
in the vehicles out there.

173
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,510
And Media will get you access
your on board media if you

174
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,340
have some music stored on the
phone, some files that you

175
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,410
purchased on the phone, or you
can also access your connected

176
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,820
music like internet radio.

177
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,330
You can access your personalized
radio.

178
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,940
So that's also possible
with this application.

179
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,320
Places is a complete turn by
turn navigation on board, and

180
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,640
on board here means on
the phone itself.

181
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,770
So we have the Maps locally
stored on the phone, and we

182
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,550
have the whole navigation
engine, route matching, and

183
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,060
destination entry
on the phone.

184
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,480
That product is actually
available on iPhone.

185
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,090
It's already released
last year.

186
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,150
It's available in about 20
different markets, and we

187
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,970
started from that.

188
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,590
We looked at that, and we
actually in the process of

189
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,017
developing the Android version
of this too to

190
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:10,140
run on Android phones.

191
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,910
But that's what we
have out there.

192
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,610
And we looked into what we can
do with that and what we can

193
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,850
add into this.

194
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,850
So the first thing that we, of
course, thought about is how

195
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,070
to make that on board navigation
engine that is not

196
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,830
connected, how do you make it
a hybrid navigation engine?

197
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,450
How do you had the connectivity
piece of it to

198
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,360
interact with Google Places and
become basically a hybrid

199
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,420
navigation system?

200
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,850
So we did a lot of things, and
you can watch them and

201
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,220
experience them in the car that
we brought out in the

202
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,306
Sandbox area of Google Maps.

203
00:09:44,306 --> 00:09:47,150
But I will focus here and we
will focus our talks on three

204
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,900
different things we consider
kind of major, and we would

205
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,860
like to discuss this
with you today.

206
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,740
The one thing that stands out
is a single text box-based

207
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,950
destination entry.

208
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,980
Basically, what you have in
Google Maps for years is now

209
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,960
available in the car.

210
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,470
You don't have to think about,
I'm going to search, or I'm

211
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:13,300
going to input a
street address.

212
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,820
You don't have to think
about these things.

213
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,580
You just type what you want
and the system has an

214
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,030
autocomplete function powered
by Google Places API to find

215
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,970
what you want.

216
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:28,140
And in few clicks as you are
trying to find the address,

217
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,600
Google Places API will propose
for you a few selections that

218
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,150
you pick the destination from.

219
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:41,300
So that was actually one of the
new things that we tried

220
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,850
to address based on the study
that we saw from JD Power, and

221
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,450
we are happy to have it
today in our cars.

222
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,345
And at least six of the top 10
major problems that customers

223
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:55,140
are complaining from probably
are gone with this.

224
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,600
The second thing is once you
are in the car and you're

225
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,580
actually driving from Point A to
Point B, you probably want

226
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,540
to know more about Point A or
Point B or something in

227
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,410
between, so we offer you this
kind of rich metadata and

228
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,790
visual information that helps
you while you're driving to

229
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,500
get more information about
your drive experience.

230
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,490
So we enable you to review
Google+ local photos.

231
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,970
We enable you to browse Street
Views around the destination

232
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,490
that you're going to.

233
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,735
If you are actually driving to
a business location, we let

234
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:31,640
you see the ratings or
the opening hours.

235
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,990
And of course, you can make
phone calls and call and order

236
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,440
pizza if you're doing to a pizza
place to pick up your

237
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,965
pizza, or make a reservation
in a restaurant.

238
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,140
And at the end of the day, you
most likely want to navigate,

239
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,770
so we let you get, of course,
turn by turn directions to the

240
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,020
destination.

241
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,190

242
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,740
And in many other cases, you
just want to glance and get an

243
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,220
idea about your surrounding
environment.

244
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,580
So we added the ability to
overlay real time information

245
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,000
on Google Maps.

246
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,615
So you can actually just glance
and see the weather in

247
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:10,290
the area around you, or you can
see the traffic situation

248
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,090
in the area around you.

249
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,930
So that's the third thing that
I would like to discuss and

250
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,060
highlight today here
in the talk.

251
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,350
There were some challenges,
of course, like any other

252
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,410
interesting development
project.

253
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,310
And I will talk about some
of the automotive related

254
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,510
challenges we faced.

255
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,910
In automotive in anything we do,
there are a few challenges

256
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,010
that come whether we integrate
with Google or we integrate

257
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:40,680
with other features and
service providers.

258
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,240
The automotive related
challenges that we have, one

259
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,680
of them is the reliability
requirements.

260
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,120

261
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Probably not too many of you
developed automotive

262
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,060
applications before, but
all of you drive car.

263
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,860
And as you're driving the car,
the last thing you expect is

264
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,570
to have a system that hangs in
the car or the need to restart

265
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,510
a system in the car.

266
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,050
That's completely unacceptable
and unheard of, and customers

267
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,840
do not expect that and
will not allow that.

268
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,460
So that's a little
bit different.

269
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,640
We all want to develop
bug-free features and

270
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,590
applications, but the reality
is there are a few bugs.

271
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,670
How you judge those bugs, some
of the things that you might

272
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,300
look at in a mobile environment,
like on the

273
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,340
smartphone, something that you
could fix in the next release,

274
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,570
we cannot release it with.

275
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,870
It's a showstopper for us.

276
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,890
We stop.

277
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,210
We have to fix them.

278
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,820
So reliability requirements
here are extremely high in

279
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,160
automotive environment.

280
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,090
Even though the app is running
on smartphone, but once you

281
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,030
get in the car, you see it on
the car display so it's a part

282
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,510
of the car system, and
immediately, the expectations

283
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,430
of customers are different.

284
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,980
The second thing is
release cycle.

285
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,320
We of course can update the app
every couple of weeks on

286
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,680
the phone, but what happens
on the car side?

287
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,370
The app has to talk to some
hardware on the car side, and

288
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,020
that hardware somehow is
also related to the

289
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,190
car development cycle.

290
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,490
And the car development cycle,
as you all know, is probably

291
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,500
between three to four years.

292
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,230
And we can release an app
every couple of weeks.

293
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,290
So how do you match these
two different cycles?

294
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:18,620
So that's an issue that
we had to deal with.

295
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,000
We have also that hardware
that lives in the car to

296
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,930
receive the contents from the
applications and display them

297
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,370
on the car side.

298
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,750
It has to be automotive grade.

299
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,170
And automotive grade means
many different things.

300
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,410
The hardware, to be automotive
grade, means lots

301
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,300
of different things.

302
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,650
But in general, it's about
temperature range.

303
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,530
It has to work in Alaska, it has
to work in Mojave Desert

304
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,530
if you leave the car
for a week there.

305
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,000
It has to work everywhere in
extreme heat and extreme cold

306
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,510
environments.

307
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,390
It has to work under different
conditions of vibrations.

308
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,350
So if you're driving on a
concrete road, on a dirt road,

309
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,760
on an asphalt road, different
conditions for vibrations, it

310
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,970
has to follow and work within
an environment that's very

311
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,510
challenging from a mission
point of view.

312
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,280
And there are so many other
things for automotive grade

313
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,500
hardware that we actually have
to follow and make sure our

314
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,915
hardware will actually become,
at the end of the day, an

315
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:24,450
automotive grade hardware.

316
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,420
What that means is that we
cannot just tap to an existing

317
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,020
pool of hardware that's
available out there.

318
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,670
And for any hardware to be put
in the car, it has to go

319
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,650
through a very rigid and tedious
process of being

320
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,250
qualified as an automotive grade
hardware and maybe even

321
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,890
change it to become an
automotive grade hardware

322
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,680
which makes it, of course, a
little bit more expensive and

323
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,070
also makes it a little bit late
to come to the market.

324
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,970
So I cannot just step to the
chipset that was just released

325
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,810
last week and put
it in my car.

326
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,970
I will have to take it into
a process to make it an

327
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,790
automotive grade hardware.

328
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,390

329
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,920
Last but not least, the
driver distraction.

330
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,690
As you are inside your
car, you are driving.

331
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,650
That's the main job of every
driver is to drive.

332
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,520
Eyes on the road, hands
on the wheel.

333
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,020
Anything else is actually
secondary.

334
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,500
Anything else is background.

335
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,790
So our application has to
function in a way that's not

336
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,450
distracting for the driver,
and that is itself a big

337
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,230
challenge because even though
there are guidelines,

338
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,620
interpreting the guidelines and
following the guidelines

339
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,960
is a big challenge.

340
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,390
There are AAM guidelines in
North America, there is ISO

341
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,870
guidelines in Europe, there is
JAMA guidelines in Japan.

342
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,266
And we follow all these
guidelines and we designed the

343
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:42,400
app to satisfy all
these guidelines.

344
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,080
Now, some challenges are also
related to how you implement

345
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,210
Google Places API in
that environment.

346
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,230
The first one is the end
to end use case.

347
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,340
We are actually stitching
two things together.

348
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,010
We are still using the on board
navigation maps and on

349
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:03,350
board navigation core, and
actually augmenting that and

350
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,390
adding to that the information
and the experiences we're

351
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,000
getting from Google
Places API.

352
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,790
And at the end of the day,
customers do not need to worry

353
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,829
about that, do not need
to care about that.

354
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,460
The customer needs just end to
end experience that's smooth

355
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,099
and seamless, and that provided
a challenge for us.

356
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:26,540
The second thing is the reality
of cellular coverage.

357
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,830
It's not a secret that you are
driving in the United States

358
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,180
especially in many areas
that do not have

359
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,710
good cellular coverage.

360
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,000
You get from 3G to 2G, and then

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,310
sometimes you get to zero.

362
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,200
There is no G at all.

363
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,720
There is nothing.

364
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,280
There is no connectivity
at all.

365
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,660
And if you are in the middle
of [INAUDIBLE]

366
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,380
entry and you are making a
request to Google back end to

367
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,495
get the information and you lose
connectivity, what are

368
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:53,370
you going to do?

369
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,770
So the fallback scenario on how
you gracefully fall back

370
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,690
when you make requests and you
don't get an answer and how

371
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,870
the user will see that in
front of it is a great

372
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,790
challenge here because customers
expect the system to

373
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,980
work, obviously.

374
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,120
And then assuming that we solve
the end to end use case

375
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,190
problem and we have good
coverage and you've got the

376
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,950
information, now how can you
stitch all these different

377
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,960
databases together?

378
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,050
These databases, they have
different formats.

379
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,710
They're optimized for different
conditions.

380
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,180
And just trying to get the right
information to show in

381
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,110
the right location is a
challenge in itself.

382
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:42,450
So how did we think about ways
to make a successful

383
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,940
automotive App Engine?

384
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,720
How did we do that?

385
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,680
For DriveStyle App, we developed
a strategy that's

386
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,330
based on very few
requirements.

387
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,820
The first one is to focus
on user experience,

388
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,800
not number of features.

389
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,980
So we actually have access to a
huge number of features and

390
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,520
we pick and choose
few of them.

391
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,570
We don't offer everything.

392
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,320
We offer a few of them.

393
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,860
If for some of you, it makes
sense to have 200 different

394
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,270
apps on your phone, probably for
many of you, you wouldn't

395
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,450
need that in the car.

396
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,150
You need a few that are done
right, and that's what we are

397
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,980
focusing on here.

398
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,150
We focused on social.

399
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,570
We know that people now, they
have their own digital

400
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,730
lifestyle, and we know that the
car is part of that and in

401
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,690
many cases, that goes
around social.

402
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,060
So in Digital DriveStyle, we
made sure that your navigation

403
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,630
is part of your social
experience, your media is part

404
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,680
of your social experience,
and vice versa.

405
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,620
So social is a core component
in everything we do.

406
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,510
And context is also extremely
important in car environment

407
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,760
because you don't have a lot
of time to choose from

408
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,630
multiple options.

409
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,830
So we use context here to limit
the number of things.

410
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,880
So when you do a search for
pizza, we don't show you the

411
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,590
pizza everywhere around
in the United States.

412
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,385
We show you just the pizza
around your location because

413
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:06,190
most likely, that's what
you're looking for.

414
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:11,070
So context is extremely
important in that regard.

415
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,410
We don't develop the app and
then adjust it to satisfy

416
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,340
driver distraction requirements
or to avoid

417
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,360
driver distraction.

418
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,030
We don't do that.

419
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,590
We actually design the app from
the beginning, one of the

420
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,520
input and constraints in the
design is the driver

421
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,530
distraction guidelines.

422
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,900
So we start with that,
not end with that.

423
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,930
And that's extremely important
because it's in the DNA of the

424
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,110
app itself that it will
run in a car.

425
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,750
Then we keep, as much as
possible, logic and

426
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,640
information on the phone side
because we know that is the

427
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,220
side that we control better.

428
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,710
We can update that
much faster.

429
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,840
And there is some software, of
course, living on the hardware

430
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,770
in the car, but we minimize that
to the minimal amount in

431
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,420
order to be able to innovate
much faster

432
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,130
independent of the car.

433
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,430
What is the long term goal?

434
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,900
So what we want, at the end of
the day, at one point, is a

435
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,970
seamless experience
in navigation and

436
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,070
in everything else.

437
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:20,190
So you basically don't have to
send information from your

438
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,950
laptop to the car or from
your phone to the car.

439
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,640
We want the information
to be available.

440
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,580
We want one state for you
navigation, whether you are

441
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,520
working on your desktop or
working on your laptop, on

442
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,760
your smartphone, or you're
actually getting in the car,

443
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,850
the state is maintained and the
state is available for you

444
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,050
for navigation and for
other features too.

445
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,910
So that's what we would like
to have at the end.

446
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,920
And we will get there.

447
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,180
We'll get to that point
eventually.

448
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,380
So I would like now to pass the
microphone to Mike Cheng

449
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,760
from our team to talk a little
bit about the implementation.

450
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,840

451
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,990
MIKE CHENG: Thanks, Kal.

452
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,580
So I'd like to share with all of
you some of our experiences

453
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,540
and lessons learned in
developing the DriveStyle

454
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,200
application and bringing the
Places API into this product.

455
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,880
I'd like to cover how to improve
traditional address

456
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,510
entry and destination entry,
and then we'll move on and

457
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,160
talk a little bit about how
to create a system that's

458
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,280
connected and brings information
from the web into

459
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,920
the product.

460
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,950
And then we'll talk a little
bit about the Google Maps

461
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,850
solutions that we use in the
Digital DriveStyle app.

462
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,450
So let's start with the
destination entry.

463
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,940
This screen is probably familiar
to a lot of you.

464
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,760
It's the traditional
address entry flow.

465
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,660
So at the top, you have entry
fields for state, and then you

466
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,280
select a city, and then you
select a street, and then if

467
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,550
you want, you can go select
a house number.

468
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:50,060
And even after that, you can
select an intersection

469
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,570
if you wanted to.

470
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,360
This is a really tedious process
because each entry

471
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,330
that you go into, you need to
then go into the speller and

472
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:57,980
type it out.

473
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,010
And this is so tedious to use
while driving that, according

474
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,820
to the AAM standards
in the US, it's not

475
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,830
allowed while driving.

476
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,040
So you need to be stopped on
the side of the road or in

477
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,570
your garage, for example.

478
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,650
But I think the bigger issue
here is that people don't

479
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,530
really use street addresses
anymore.

480
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,130
Just like how on your phone you
have phone numbers, but

481
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,890
you get the phone number
from your friend once

482
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,870
and then it's stored.

483
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,270
It's stored on your device.

484
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,360
It's stored in the
cloud somewhere.

485
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,440
It's stored in your
social network.

486
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,210
So what can we do to improve
the experience?

487
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,760
So we took a close look at how
Google manages this product.

488
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,790
So we look to Google Maps
online, and we really want

489
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,680
this experience of, instead of
telling my navigation system

490
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,470
where I want to go, I should
tell it what want to do.

491
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,480
The solution should help me
reduce the number of inputs

492
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,570
that I need to enter.

493
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:59,780
So you see here that I type in
C-O-F, and already, I have

494
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,870
suggestions for coffee shops
and businesses matching

495
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,490
"coffee." And most importantly,
we need to make

496
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,970
this safe to use
while driving.

497
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,640

498
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,210
So with that in mind, we've
taken advantage of the Places

499
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,920
Query Autocomplete APIs.

500
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,160
it's a really nice API that
returns us a mixed list of

501
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,140
query suggestions &mdash;

502
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,730
so coffee bean, coffee,
coffee shops &mdash;

503
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,600
as well as a few business
names, so Coffee Inc and

504
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,560
Coffee Bar.

505
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,660
You see on the right
here that it's not

506
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,090
limited to just queries.

507
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,170
You can actually start
typing in an address.

508
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,690
So 800 H matches to 800 Howard
Street, which is actually the

509
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,540
address for the Moscone
Center for people

510
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,940
who don't know addresses.

511
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,440
If I type in 850, it immediately
matches our office

512
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,410
in Palo Alto at 850
Hanson Way.

513
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,010
And so typically with three
or four characters, I can

514
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,220
actually get exactly what I
want, and this enables a user

515
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,790
experience that's much more
similar to Google Maps than

516
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,040
what we had before.

517
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,140

518
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,820
So let's take a look at what
happens underneath, just at a

519
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,050
very high level.

520
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,500
At the top, you see boxes
for the Google Places

521
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,910
queries that we make.

522
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:19,130
These are API endpoints that
we have access to.

523
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,860
At the bottom, you get an
example of the responses

524
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,630
coming back from
these queries.

525
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,840
So if we type in the example
from before, C-O-F, we put

526
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,540
this into the Places Query
Autocomplete, the Autocomplete

527
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,400
API returns us the list of
coffee bean, coffee, coffee

528
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,450
shops, coffee drink,
coffee bar.

529
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,730
But these are just
string results.

530
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,970
It doesn't have any metadata
associated with it.

531
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,040
So the next step that we need
to take is we need to take

532
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,250
that coffee query completion and
then put it into the Place

533
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,190
Search API.

534
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,110
So this Place Search API will
actually return me businesses

535
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:02,750
or establishments or street
addresses, for example.

536
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,640
You see here that there's
some duplication.

537
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,790
So the two items on the bottom
for the Query Autocomplete

538
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,570
also show up for Place Search,
so we'll try to optimize for

539
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,770
that a little bit.

540
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,180
But the Place Search will give
us a reference that we can

541
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,610
then put into the Place Details
API to get back rich

542
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,870
metadata about this location
such as the lat, long, the

543
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,340
opening hours, review
data, and so on.

544
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,890

545
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:30,300
So actually, what's new since
about two days ago, the Places

546
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,400
Query Autocomplete API Response
does return you the

547
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,880
reference for locations such
as 800 Howard Street.

548
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,450
So this is really handy because
in our flow that we

549
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,120
saw before, we basically
remove an entire step.

550
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,780
So that's an entire request to
the network, and you need to

551
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,560
wait for a response.

552
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,940
We've simplified it from three
requests down to two.

553
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,600
So that's really helping us in
improving the performance for

554
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,470
our customers, and I'll talk a
little bit later about why you

555
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,610
should not count on the
network being there.

556
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,210

557
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,970
So here, we have a
comparison video.

558
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,230
On the left, you have the
traditional address entry, and

559
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,530
then on the right, you
have the address

560
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,150
entry powered by Google.

561
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,510
I'll play this video
really quick.

562
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,940
Watch the right very closely
because it goes quick.

563
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,540
On the left side, it
takes a little bit

564
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,890
longer, and you'll see.

565
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,860

566
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,510
So here we go.

567
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,840
On the right side, we
have a search field.

568
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,320
We type in 1, and immediately,
we have 1600

569
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,080
Amphitheater Parkway.

570
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,980
We select it, and then we go,
we calculate a route, and

571
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,130
we're done.

572
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,860
So that was about 10 seconds.

573
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,233
On the left, we're still
typing in Amphitheater.

574
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:44,770

575
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,720
OK.

576
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,570
House number 1600.

577
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,820
OK.

578
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,190

579
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,540
And there we go.

580
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,780
So on the right with the Places
API, we've cut down the

581
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,480
amount of time it takes
to enter an

582
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,790
address by two thirds.

583
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,250
So the one on the right takes
10 seconds, the one on the

584
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,890
left takes 30 seconds.

585
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,080
So we expect this to be a huge
improvement to the product.

586
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,600
We expect it to be the best
implementation, actually, of

587
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,830
destination entry in any
automotive product when it's

588
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,080
released next month.

589
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,600

590
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,380
So let's talk about going
beyond street addresses.

591
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,750
So again, we look at for the
Google Maps APIs again and

592
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,400
Google Maps Web Service, and we
see that we have a lot of

593
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,300
social features.

594
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,390
So you see that we have Street
View here, we have Photos, we

595
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,910
have Reviews and Ratings.

596
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,770
So this is how we've brought
this into our product.

597
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,590
Using the Place Details API, you
get all this information

598
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,090
for star ratings and
opening hours.

599
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,820
We also get the Google+
Local Photos back,

600
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,750
which is very nice.

601
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,520
It feels like you've been to
that location without actually

602
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,960
having been there.

603
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,870
And of course, the immersity
of Google Street View

604
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,610
experience, which I highly
recommend everybody to go to

605
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,800
our SL 550 outside to experience
for yourself.

606
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,620

607
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,630
A little bit about blending
online data with offline maps.

608
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,740
Don't count on having a
network connection.

609
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,020
You could be driving through the
desert or driving through

610
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,300
the forest or coming to Google
I/O where there's no network

611
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,330
connection whatsoever.

612
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,580
Cache as much as you can.

613
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,500
Cache aggressively.

614
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,890
Don't block or restrict the UI
or the flow if you don't have

615
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,520
a network connection
because customers

616
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,050
absolutely hate that.

617
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:43,570
Map data can be different or
incomplete, so with an off

618
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,520
board solution where you're
grabbing everything from the

619
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,900
internet, the data is always
constantly updating.

620
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,290
And in markets such as China,
actually, there are actually

621
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,100
lots of changes being made to
the infrastructure constantly,

622
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,120
so streets are being built,
businesses are moving around,

623
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,010
and it's most likely not going
to match your on board data.

624
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,420
And then finally,
be careful with

625
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,790
geocodes and reverse geocodes.

626
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,040
If you have an address and you
convert that into a lat long,

627
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,800
don't convert it back
to an address.

628
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,600
It's not going to be
the same address.

629
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,260
Just be consistent in how you
store this information and how

630
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,510
you present it to the user.

631
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,440

632
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,020
And then finally, unique maps.

633
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,640
Our product actually takes
advantage of the Google Maps

634
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,750
SDK for iOS.

635
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,170
It's a really nice library that
you can integrate into

636
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,550
your product.

637
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,010
You link a few libraries and
you reference a resource

638
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,140
bundle, and you're basically
ready to go.

639
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,740
It matches very closely to other
map frameworks, so you

640
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,520
get access to all of these 3D
buildings and traffic players

641
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,770
and map types.

642
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,790

643
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,780
And finally, we have our Heatmap
concept, which is

644
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:02,210
based off of the Places
API Radar Search.

645
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,120
The Radar Search was actually
initially released by Google

646
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,210
in January of this year.

647
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,820
We'll be the first automotive
manufacturer actually to take

648
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,770
advantage of these APIs.

649
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,490
What the API does is it returns
you a point cloud of

650
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,880
200 locations around
a certain location.

651
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,170
So we can generate these
density maps

652
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,820
based off of the data.

653
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,080
So you see the white spots here
are higher density, and

654
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,510
then the darker spots
are lower density.

655
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,830
And it really gives you an idea
of the character of a

656
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,740
certain location if you haven't
been there before.

657
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,540

658
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:42,090
Just a quick note on the
JavaScript Maps API that we

659
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,620
use for City Guide.

660
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,270
One technique that we've
actually used is instead of

661
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:54,540
referencing image data stored on
disk, we Base64 encode all

662
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,940
of the image data and feed
it directly into

663
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,740
the JavaScript API.

664
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,770
This gives us a few
advantages.

665
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,540
The JavaScript API, we can sense
this image data without

666
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,850
a network connection.

667
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,930
So once your maps have loaded,
then you can basically change

668
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,600
the overlay as often
as you want.

669
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,500
And the second point is that you
have no need to save the

670
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,360
image data to disk, so you
gain some performance

671
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,610
improvements there.

672
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,080

673
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,340
And that's pretty much it.

674
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,060
So thanks a lot.

675
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,800
We've hopefully given you some
insight into how we've

676
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,090
developed the Digital DriveStyle
app, and please

677
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,460
stop by our Sandbox demo.

678
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,200
CHRIS CARDE: So it looks like
we've got about seven minutes

679
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,320
left for questions.

680
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,160
We have two microphones set up
in the aisles, and if anyone

681
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,160
would like to come up, this
is your chance to ask an

682
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,740
automaker anything about
navigation or infotainment.

683
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,130
Anybody?

684
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:51,876
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

685
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:54,715
I've got a couple use cases that
seem to be pretty common

686
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:56,490
when I want to go somewhere
in my car.

687
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,760
One, someone texts me an
address, and then I've got to

688
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,370
somehow put that in either the
car nav or my phone, and

689
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,060
that's pretty annoying.

690
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,680
Two, I'm at my desktop, I find
somewhere I want to go, do all

691
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,180
my navigation, figure
out my route.

692
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,350
Now I've got to somehow get
that into my car, too.

693
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:19,970
Do you foresee some way of
making that transparently

694
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,270
entered into the car nav so that
there's maybe no UI and

695
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,050
it just somehow gets there?

696
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,430
How would you handle
that, I guess?

697
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,610
MIKE CHENG: Yeah.

698
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,460
That's actually a very
interesting problem, one that

699
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,670
we're hoping to solve.

700
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,300
We've kind of handled the
problem the opposite way, so

701
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,860
we've integrated Glimpse
into our product.

702
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,090
And what this does is that we
can actually send our current

703
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,120
location to a third party
so that they know

704
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,200
where you are, at least.

705
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,060
I think the next step to that
is to bring it the other way

706
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,860
around so that somebody can send
you a destination or you

707
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,110
can send yourself
a destination.

708
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,940
CHRIS CARDE: And I should point
out that Google Maps

709
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,810
does already have a feature
called Send To Car.

710
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,290
We do integrate with a number of
automakers to allow you to

711
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,710
send an address directly
from Google Maps

712
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,960
to a connected vehicle.

713
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,600

714
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,400
AUDIENCE: Another question.

715
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,719
What about voice control
integration in the car?

716
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,929
I just represents a company that
develops technological

717
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:18,000
systems for the car called
Robin service.

718
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,600
KAL MOS: So the application
itself

719
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,400
today runs on the iPhone.

720
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,080
We have Siri integration
completely

721
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,690
integrated in the product.

722
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,610
On the Android version that we
are working on, we are looking

723
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,370
into integrating the Google
Voice as part of that.

724
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,810
You have text to speech built
in on board, so there is

725
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,100
always text to speech to read
stuff back to you, to read

726
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,900
your Facebook postings and the
different information to you.

727
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,179
But more than that, just for the
interaction itself, we're

728
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:52,860
going to depend on the voice
integration that comes with

729
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,290
the phone itself.

730
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,190
AUDIENCE: OK, I look in
our products also.

731
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,200
It's right there.

732
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,920
AUDIENCE: You mentioned having
to comply with automotive

733
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,140
grade hardware.

734
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,380
What about the consumer-provided
cell phone?

735
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,911
Is that considered automotive
grade, or did you have to do

736
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:11,120
anything special for that?

737
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,130
KAL MOS: No.

738
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,100
Of course, the phone itself
is whatever phone you buy.

739
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,330
It's usually not automotive
grade.

740
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:23,580
Today, you will still have to
plug the phone, but we offer

741
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,640
the phone a place where you can
plug it close to you, like

742
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,840
in the armrest, for example,
where you can plug it.

743
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,180
Usually, you don't leave a phone
in the car, and that's a

744
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,280
huge difference from the
hardware itself.

745
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,550
The hardware is always
in the car.

746
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,180
When you park the car
in the desert for 10

747
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,730
hours, it is there.

748
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,020
But your phone is always in your
pocket, and that's why

749
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,470
the problem is not that
severe with the phone.

750
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,460
The phone is usually with you,
and once you come into the

751
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,250
car, the phone is usually within
your vicinity, and

752
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:54,060
that's always air conditioned
and a nice environment that

753
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,680
doesn't really have to satisfy
lots of automotive grade

754
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,166
requirements.

755
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,416
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

756
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:03,130

757
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:03,390
AUDIENCE: Hi.

758
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,200
I'm interested to know where you
think it will be in, say,

759
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,530
five years down the line?

760
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:12,440
What's your ambition for the
socialization of the

761
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,880
automotive experience
at Mercedes Benz?

762
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,040
Is that something you think will
develop in partnership

763
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,280
with Google?

764
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,730
I'm kind of interested to know
how experimental you are right

765
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,180
now with all of these
restrictions you

766
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,360
also have to consider.

767
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,626
KAL MOS: We are as open as
we can be, I would say.

768
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:33,230
We look into this seamless
experience, really.

769
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:36,850
We think the car is part of
your digital lifestyle.

770
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,090
We need to maintain the state.

771
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,190
I want to have one state
for everything.

772
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,320
Whatever you do on the phone,
I want it to be available in

773
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,320
the car without you sending
anything back and forth.

774
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,340
So that is what I'm looking at,
is that whatever the next

775
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,000
greatest applications and
features that Google will come

776
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,020
up with and other companies
will come up with, I want

777
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,520
these to be immediately
available in the car without

778
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,250
needing to synchronize and send
things back and forth.

779
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,950
So that's, I think,
where we can go.

780
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,350
And what we're trying to do is
to develop a platform that we

781
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,260
can easily provide that.

782
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,010
So it's a platform that runs
on a phone, so I can always

783
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,890
push the newest and greatest
update to it.

784
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:20,630
I open information on the car
side as much as possible so I

785
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,290
can take advantage of the
sensors in the car and merge

786
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,770
that with all the information
that comes from the back end.

787
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:29,300
The vision that we have for the
car really is that because

788
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,710
the car, at the end of the
day, is your friend.

789
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,840
It knows about you.

790
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,950
It knows about your customs
and habits.

791
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,630
It knows about what you did on
your phone a few minutes ago.

792
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,005
And you should not come to the
car every time and start from

793
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:43,220
zero again.

794
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,950
You should just continue what
you've been doing as you get

795
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,750
in the car.

796
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,950
And the only difference,
of course,

797
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,870
is that you're driving.

798
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,460
So that's our job, is to make
sure that you can continue

799
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,790
what you were doing but in a
safe, non-distracting way.

800
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,100
AUDIENCE: In the future, is it
planned to be across every

801
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,880
single variation of
Mercedes vehicle?

802
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,110
KAL MOS: Well actually, the app
is offered now in most of

803
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,680
our car lines.

804
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,470
So it's offered in the
A class, B class,

805
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:10,290
E class, and CLA.

806
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,340
We're offering it one by one
to all different models.

807
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,510
So that's the target, yes.

808
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:21,670
There is a heavy focus, of
course, on the new cars.

809
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,310
It's a little bit hard to go
backwards and try to offer it

810
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,900
for existing customers on
the road for 10 years.

811
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,190
But that's part of what we're
trying to do that once we

812
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,580
offer it now, it will actually
live with you in

813
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,620
the coming few years.

814
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,890
And even five years from now,
you can still have the latest

815
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,110
and greatest experience
in a car that you

816
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,520
bought five years ago.

817
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,770
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

818
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,090

819
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,350
CHRIS CARDE: OK, well, I think
we're just about out of time.

820
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,150
Thank you very much
for coming.

821
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,960
We'll be available in the
Sandbox area for at least 15

822
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,750
minutes, 30 minutes thereafter
to answer questions.

823
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,800
Come see us.

824
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,730
Come see the demo.

825
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,980
Thanks again.

826
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,358
