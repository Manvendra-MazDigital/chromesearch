COLT MCANLIS: If you're a
developer who finds that

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,540
you're pushing the edges of
the web platform, you're

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,790
really butting up against what
is sort of available with our

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,640
tooling chain, and what the
web and the W3C, and the

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,210
specs, and the standards bodies
are exposing, and it's

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,770
hampering you from really
realizing the vision of what

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,360
you have for your product, you
should be at this conference.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,500
Because we want to hear your
voice about what's going on in

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,710
your company and how we
can make it a reality.

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,540
This is going to be one of the
first times where we're trying

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,120
to get the managers and the
engineers who are writing the

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,250
Chrome code in the same room
with the people who are using

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,170
our platform.

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,360
And so it's really important
that developers actually show

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,730
up with a sense of what they
want to get out of that

17
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,490
conversation.

18
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,840
So come with your bug list.

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,540
Come with performance repos.

20
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,190
Come expecting that you can
sit down with the product

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,460
manager of Chrome and tell him
exactly what he's doing wrong

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,110
in his day to day
job and why that

23
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,950
matters to you as a developer.

24
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,050
My name is Colt McAnlis.

25
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,410
And at Chrome Dev Summit, I'm
going to be giving a talk

26
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,050
that's going to overview
everything you need to know to

27
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,710
become a performance ninja,
using Chrome dev tools for

28
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,110
your web applications.

29
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:05,860
Come find me.

30
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,980
I want to talk to you.

31
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,710
I want to hear about the
problems you're having with

32
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,330
performance and what I can
do to make your web

33
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,580
application a success.

34
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:22,012
