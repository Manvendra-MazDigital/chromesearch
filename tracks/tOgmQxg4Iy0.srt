00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:05,050
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to
Google Developers Weekly

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,950
for December 9, 2013.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,830
I'm Louis Gray and this
is our highlight reel

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,720
of what's happening in the world
of Google Developers on the set

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,831
and off.

7
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:14,830
The big news from the
world of Google Developers

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,880
last week was the
general availability

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,720
of Google Compute Engine.

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,880
Our Cloud Compute
service offers 99.95%

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,250
monthly SLA, 24 by
7 service, support

12
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,720
for additional flavors of Linux,
reduced prices, and much more.

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,760
So you'll want to
check this out.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,810
Alongside the launch of
Google Compute Engine,

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,260
Paul Rashidi debuted a
10-minute test drive here

16
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,910
on GDL-- walking us through the
process of creating a project,

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,020
setting up a cloud-based
virtual machine,

18
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,360
and installing a web
server-- very helpful.

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,200
And maybe even fun.

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,650
Our more grounded teammates
in Google Analytics,

21
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,650
Andrew Wales and
Nick Mihailovski,

22
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,580
told customers how to upgrade
to Universal Analytics

23
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,560
and answered some of the
many commonly asked questions

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,490
about the web's favorite
measurement tool.

25
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,230
Every click counts.

26
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,050
And don't we know it?

27
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,450
We were pleased to welcome back
Walleteers Peng Ying and Maru

28
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,190
Ahues Bouza.

29
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,830
The pair walked through the
Wallet Objects API Quickstart

30
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,540
sample, setting you up
to connect your business

31
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,390
to millions of Google users,
showcasing your loyalty

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,610
programs, offers, and more.

33
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,580
And Maps master Mano
Marks followed on

34
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,670
with his first event in his new
location, soon to be revealed.

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,030
This week's focus-- map padding
in the Google Maps SDK for iOS.

36
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,210
Map padding allows you to change
the visible region of your map

37
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,070
so that your controls,
logo, and copyright notices

38
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,970
are all aligned with your view.

39
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,340
From Milan, Sandro
Paganotti dives

40
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,350
into the promise of
HTML5 custom elements,

41
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,100
helping us create new
HTML code elements that

42
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,040
are reusable and readable.

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,890
Even more challenging, he
does the entire presentation

44
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,810
in Italian.

45
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,330
Incredible.

46
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,350
Wrapping up our studio
events for last week

47
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,870
is the first in a series from
our Google Developer Experts

48
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,000
team and the YouTube
developers squad.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,040
Frequent GDL guest Jeremy Walker
talks with GDE Jarom McDonald

50
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,400
about the many contributions
that he and others

51
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,090
have made to the
YouTube API community.

52
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,480
Watch for more interviews
in coming weeks here

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,490
on the Weekly Wrap Up.

54
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,820
Around here, we think
fast is better than slow.

55
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,300
And we're always working
to make the web faster.

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,890
This week, web performance
guru, Ilya Grigorik,

57
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,260
wrote about HTTP 2.0--
a developing protocol

58
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,440
that makes applications faster,
simpler and more robust.

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,730
Read Ilya's article to
learn in great detail

60
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,960
how HTTP 2.0 will
speed up the web.

61
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,270
Just go to acm.org and search
for "making the web faster."

62
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,510
We also love making
it faster and easier

63
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,490
for you to develop
great mobile apps.

64
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,380
To help, Chrome
DevTools just got

65
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,300
a couple of wonderful
new features.

66
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,190
First, when you're
remote debugging,

67
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,730
Screencast lets you see
your mobile device screen

68
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,920
right along your tools.

69
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,390
And Mobile Emulation
lets you realistically

70
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,350
emulate many device
characteristics

71
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,960
on your desktop.

72
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,380
Read all about it
at html5rocks.com.

73
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,270
That's html5rocks.com.

74
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,740
And to make sure that you never
miss a thing from the world

75
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,470
