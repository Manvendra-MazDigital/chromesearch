1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,680
Let's look at modern remote
debugging with Chrome.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,263
I'm going to take
the URL of this demo

4
00:00:04,263 --> 00:00:05,990
and open it up in
Chrome on Android.

5
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,070
And now on the remote debugging
page, we see its GPU layers.

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,030
More on that later.

7
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,942
What I really want to show
you is this &mdash; Screencast.

8
00:00:14,942 --> 00:00:16,650
You're looking at the
live view of Chrome

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,992
on Android on your machine.

10
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:19,950
It shows exactly what's
happening on the device

11
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,491
all the time.

12
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:23,380
But better than that, you can
actually interact with it.

13
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,410
So typing here with
my fingers is slow.

14
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,380
Let's switch the keyboard.

15
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,260
Yeah, so all keystrokes are
sent down to the device.

16
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,090
And clicks and drags are
sent down as touches, too.

17
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,590
You can scroll with
your mouse wheel

18
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,130
or trackpad and see your
device scroll with you.

19
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,710
Probably my favorite is &mdash;
yep, inspect element.

20
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,170
It works the way
you'd want it to,

21
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,086
selecting the elements
in the device's browser

22
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:48,150
and manipulating them directly.

23
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,480
Now back to those GPU layers.

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,100
Here's a complex 3D
CSS transform scene.

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,340
And DevTools gives us insight
on the live layer tree

26
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,550
composition.

27
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,440
Similarly Screencasted
remote debugging

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,290
works great with
the web GL profiler.

29
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,960
Please try all this out today.

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,000
For how, just google
for remote debugging.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,593
