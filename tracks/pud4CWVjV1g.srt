00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:10,789
EVE ANDERSSON: Today we're going to talk about
a free online course we've developed called

2
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,880
"Introduction to Web Accessibility." We will
learn about some of the tools and techniques

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,880
in this course for making websites more accessible
to people with vision impairments. My name

4
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:33,170
is Eve Andersson. I'm a manager in accessibility
engineering here at Google. And we have a

5
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:40,909
distinguished panel to my left of accessibility
experts. On my far left is Vint Cerf. He is

6
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,829
a VP at Google and our Chief Internet Evangelist.
Some have also referred to him as "one of

7
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:55,539
the Fathers of the Internet." We also have
Charles Chen, an engineer in accessibility,

8
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:01,530
and he's one of the developers of this course.
We have one more panelist who wasn't able

9
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,440
to be with us today. His name is T.V. Raman.
He is a research scientist at Google, and

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,320
he works on accessibility. He also helped
develop this course, and we'll see him later

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,720
in a video. All right, the first question
is for you, Vint. Vint, why should people

12
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,910
- why should software developers learn about
accessibility?

13
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,680
VINT: Well, let's start with a very fundamental
point: not all of the websites in the world

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,740
are readily accessible to people who need
some assistance. If you happen to be blind

15
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,220
or have vision impairment, you can't see the
web pages, and you can't interact with them

16
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,760
in the way others can. If you happen to be
deaf, or in my case, I'm hearing impaired,

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,500
there are times when you can't actually quite
make out the audio, and it would help a lot

18
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,170
if we could see captions or written material
to go along with it. There are other people

19
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,050
who have a variety of other problems that
have to be accommodated. And so this whole

20
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:04,890
notion is about assistance to make things
useful and accessible for everyone. The reason

21
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,690
that it's important to do that is twofold.
First it's the right thing to do. We want

22
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,690
everyone to take advantage of and be able
to use the benefits and fruitful content available

23
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,950
on the internet. But perhaps more important,
it's ironic that the one tool that's been

24
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:30,410
invented in the last several years - the computer
- is the one thing that can, in fact, make

25
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,540
things accessible because it's so flexible.
We can write programs to adapt and accommodate.

26
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,770
And yet that's the one area that has been
poorly treated for many, many years. It's

27
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:48,190
almost as strange as the telephone invented
by Alexander Graham Bell intending to help

28
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,940
the deaf and being useless to them until somebody
finally invented things like email and teletypes

29
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,940
and so on. So we have an obligation to take
this new technology and make it work for everyone

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,930
on the planet regardless of the needs that
they may have for assistance.

31
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,690
EVE: Thank you, Vint. So one of the things
you said was that we want the web to work

32
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:17,690
for everyone, and it currently doesn't. Charles,
could you show us what the web looks like

33
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,740
to someone who's blind?
CHARLES: Sure, Eve. So if we switch to my

34
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:29,690
screen here, I have a very simple example
running. And what you'll see is that &mdash; I'm

35
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,110
going to go over it twice. The first time
I'm going to show you what it looks like visually.

36
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,360
And then I'll show you what someone with a
visual impairment would experience the site

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,340
as. So as you can see, I have this page up
here. It looks like a simple enough page.

38
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,440
It has a title, "Button and Alert." There's
a button, and if I click it, I'll get an alert.

39
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,300
So I'm just going to click it with the mouse,
click it. "The button has been pressed!" No

40
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,430
problems. But now let's see what a user with
a visual impairment would experience. So I'm

41
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:07,430
going to turn on my screen reader here.
CHROMEVOX: ChromeVox is ready. Button and

42
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,170
Alert Example tab.
CHARLES: All right, so now my screen reader

43
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:18,699
is enabled. Let me navigate through this,
and let's experience what I hear.

44
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:23,570
CHROMEVOX: Click the button below to generate
an alert. Smile image.

45
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,180
CHARLES: Smile image. OK, that was interesting.
CHROMEVOX: If this were a real page, we would

46
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,530
have more content here.
CHARLES: Wait. Where was the button? OK, maybe

47
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,699
it was the smile image. Let's try that.
CHROMEVOX: Smile image.

48
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:40,570
CHARLES: OK, I'm going to try and press Enter
to click it. Hm. OK, nothing's happening.

49
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,630
Well, I'm a really good screen reader user,
so I know that I can try to generate some

50
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,630
sort of fake click event. Let me try and force
click this.

51
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,370
CHROMEVOX: Clicked. Smile image.
CHARLES: It says I clicked it, but I'm not

52
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:59,810
hearing anything. As you can see, this is
a pretty broken experience, and it's really

53
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,790
difficult to use if you have a visual impairment,
even for something as simple as this page.

54
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:12,460
EVE: Thanks for that. As I said earlier, TV
Raman can't be with us here today. But we

55
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,180
spent some time with him yesterday, and we'll
see a video where he talks a little bit more

56
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,900
about the content of the course, about accessible
development, as well as how we came up with

57
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,030
doing this course.
TV RAMAN: When you put up a website or you

58
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,310
write a web page, you actually don't know
who your audience is. Your audience could

59
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,250
be in the United States. Your audience could
be worldwide. Your audience might be English

60
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,970
speaking. Your audience might be speaking
another language as their first language.

61
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:48,970
So it's all about reach. And if it's all about
reach, then optimizing your content to cater

62
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:57,110
to the widest variety of needs is something
in everybody's interest. We thought wouldn't

63
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:04,889
it be nice to try using this new medium of
online education to teach something that deeply

64
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:12,889
affects the online experience. So, can we
use this online medium of web courses and

65
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:20,430
web-based education to teach web developers
how to make their websites and web contents

66
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,240
maximally useful and usable to all of their
audience? So during this class, we will both

67
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,240
teach you how to enhance your content for
accessibility and then also teach you to use

68
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:43,389
tools that check whether you have done the
needed work to make your content accessible

69
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:49,449
and also give you an opportunity to use tools
that let you experience firsthand what your

70
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:54,310
site feels like to someone who cannot see
and is trying to listen to your site. So in

71
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,259
a nutshell, we'll teach you techniques for
enhancing your content. We will show you tools

72
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:04,220
that let you first check your content, and
you'll get warnings and tips on ways we can

73
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,990
fix it. And then you'll fix it and actually
be able to experience a before-and-after.

74
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,750
We want to keep things simple for this first
course. And so we are going to narrow down

75
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:21,750
and focus on things you can do when you create
your content to make it work well for users

76
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,970
who are blind or users who have low vision.
That isn't to say that those are the only

77
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:34,020
problems you need to worry about. But this
will get you a part of the way to starting

78
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,520
to think about accessibility and about all
your users. So when you think about accessibility,

79
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,300
don't think of it as something special for
a few users. Think of it as designing your

80
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,300
content and site so that it works for everyone
independent of their needs who might happen

81
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:59,009
to come to your site. Accessibility is really
about you reaching the maximum number of devices,

82
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,430
the maximum number of users, the maximum number
of needs and abilities. Our goal is to whet

83
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,740
your appetite and get you interested. And
at the end of the course, we will point you

84
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:15,610
at additional resources that will let you
deep dive into specific areas. So enjoy the

85
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,539
course, and I hope to see you at the other
end of this course, where you are making your

86
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:25,530
sites address a lot more of the accessibility
issues that arise.

87
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:32,530
EVE: So in the video, Raman gave us a brief
overview of the content of the course. And

88
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:39,539
he mentioned that there are tools that let
you as a web developer experience a website

89
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:46,380
as a blind person does, as well as to help
you make a site more accessible. Can you show

90
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,130
us a little bit more about these tools?
CHARLES: Sure, Eve. So the two tools that

91
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:57,820
we'll be using primarily in this course are
Accessibility Developer Tools and ChromeVox.

92
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,770
Both of these are extensions that are freely
available on the Chrome Web Store, and you

93
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,760
can go ahead and download them. As you can
see on my screen, I have these tools installed.

94
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,230
So let's start with Accessibility Developer
Tools. These tools are some really simple,

95
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,910
really quick audits that will tell you if
you have problems with your web page. Now

96
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:23,880
let's try running this audit on an example
and let's see what it tells us. So I'm going

97
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:30,880
to go to Tools - I'm going to bring up Developer
Tools. And now if I switch into my Audits

98
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,670
panel, I can select Accessibility and I can
ask it to run the audit. So I'm going to run

99
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:42,890
the audit, and you see right here I get a
warning. The warning tells me that images

100
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:49,890
should have an alt attribute. Let's go ahead
and try to fix this. Ah, smile.png. That's

101
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,130
why it was saying 'smile image' rather than
the actual text of the button. So let's try

102
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:03,130
and fix this. Let me switch over to my text
editor here. Okay, so here is where I have

103
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:11,950
the image. I'm going to go ahead and add alt
text that make sense: alt="I'm a button.

104
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:23,450
Click me! smiley face" Okay, so let's save
this, and let's go back to the page, and let's

105
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:33,300
see what the audit says this time. Okay, as
you can see, I no longer have that warning.

106
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:43,170
So that's good. That's definitely an improvement.
And now let's move on to the next tool, ChromeVox.

107
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:48,350
So ChromeVox is our screen reader for Chrome
OS. It's also available as a Chrome extension

108
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,290
that anyone can install and try out. As a
web developer, this tool is really nice because

109
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,519
it gives you a way to experience what a blind
user would experience directly in your browser

110
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,200
without any real additional setup aside from
just installing the extension and enabling

111
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,480
it. So I'm going to go ahead and enable the
extension now. And let's try running through

112
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,290
this page again and let's see what it sounds
like.

113
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:18,060
CHROMEVOX: ChromeVox is ready. Button and
Alert Example tab.

114
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,550
CHARLES: OK, so let's go ahead and read through
this page now.

115
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:27,550
CHROMEVOX: Click the button below to generate
an alert. I'm a button. Click me! Smiley face.

116
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,149
CHARLES: OK, so that's nice. It told me what
this button has, but let's see. CHROMEVOX:

117
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:37,000
If this were a real page, we would have more
content here.

118
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,370
CHARLES: OK, well, from the text of that image,
I got the impression that it's a button. But

119
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,350
it still didn't tell me that it was actually
a button from a screen reader's perspective.

120
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,290
Also, if I move over it, I think I still won't
be able to click it. Let's see.

121
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,410
CHROMEVOX: I'm a button. Click me. Smiley
face.

122
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,959
CHARLES: Yeah, OK, so I still can't activate
it. So I think we still need a little bit

123
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,829
of work here, so let's go ahead and fix this.
Now, the nice thing is, even though this is

124
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:10,920
a pretty broken experience that we're starting
with, it's relatively easy to fix and correct,

125
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:17,920
as I will proceed to demonstrate. So let me
switch back to the code. And now one of the

126
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:24,360
first things to fix is to make sure that this
is actually reported to screen readers as

127
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,360
a button. So I'm going to add an ARIA role:
role="button" that makes sense. And let's

128
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:40,649
also make this button focusable and respond
to the Enter key. So I'm going to put: tabindex="0"

129
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:50,019
and I'm going to add a keydown handler. And
of course, I need to write the function for

130
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:05,390
a keydown handler, which is really quick.
All right, so this should do the trick. Let's

131
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:34,839
reload and let's see what this is like.
CHROMEVOX: Window Button and Alert. Example

132
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:41,410
Button and Alert Example. I'm a button. Click
me! Smiley face. Button.

133
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:48,000
CHARLES: OK, so as you can see now, this time
it actually reported that it was a button.

134
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,610
And let's try clicking it. OK, this was a
little bit better. It responded to the Enter

135
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,380
key. But still, as a blind user, I wouldn't
have heard the message that came up. So let's

136
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:06,380
go ahead and let's fix that. So all I need
to do here is, because it's an alert, I just

137
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:14,769
give need to give it an ARIA role of alert:
role="alert" And let's try this again.

138
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,440
CHROMEVOX: Window Button and Alert. Example
Tab. Button and &mdash; Button and Alert.

139
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,959
CHARLES: OK, so I'm going to try this again.
CHROMEVOX: Click the button below to generate

140
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,589
an alert. I'm a button, Click me! Smiley face.
Button.

141
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:32,760
CHARLES: And now I'm going to press Enter.
CHROMEVOX: The button has been pressed. Alert.

142
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,170
CHARLES: Yay! So now this all works. So as
you can see with just a little bit of code,

143
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,920
I was able to take a completely broken experience
and make it work reasonably well.

144
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,589
EVE: Thanks for that demo, Charles. So I saw
in that, that you were editing HTML and JavaScript.

145
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:53,139
CHARLES: Yes.
EVE: What do people need to know before they

146
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:55,839
can embark on this course? Who is this course
for?

147
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,880
CHARLES: Glad you asked that. So this course
is for web developers. You do need to have

148
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,310
some basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript,
and CSS. But really it's for all levels of

149
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,850
web developers. You don't necessarily have
to be a JavaScript ninja to do well in this

150
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,040
course.
VINT: Well, that looked pretty simple, actually.

151
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,490
CHARLES: Yeah, so I think what was helpful
here was that the starting design was actually

152
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,200
fairly simple, fairly straightforward. There
was nothing in the design itself that made

153
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,920
it inherently inaccessible. You have a button.
You click on it. You get a reaction. As such,

154
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,339
if the missing piece for accessibility is
at a technical level, where things aren't

155
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,740
labeled, or you don't have the right ARIA
properties, or you don't have the right keyboard

156
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,930
handlers, then it is really simple to take
these problems and address them. And you can

157
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,839
fix them in a short amount of time. And these
are also the type of solutions that we'll

158
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,610
be covering in the course. The course is a
great starting point to help you learn about

159
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,070
these fixes.
VINT: So I would take away from this example,

160
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,990
Charles, two things. First of all, the tool
that helped you discover that there was a

161
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,570
problem could be very helpful if you have
a significant amount of code - having something

162
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:05,490
staring over your shoulder and saying, "Don't
forget, you need to do something about that,"

163
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:10,500
I think is very helpful. And you demonstrated
that for at least some of the problems that

164
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,529
are identified, the fix is not all that hard.
I think that on a deeper level, though, understanding

165
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:22,350
how to create designs that can be made accessible
is a much tougher proposition. You really

166
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:28,660
have to put your head somehow in the same
place as someone who's using this with need

167
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,190
for assistance. And so although this course
is at the beginning, so to speak, at some

168
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,199
point I hope we can help people understand
what it means to do really good accessible

169
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,680
engineering. And that, of course, is the ultimate
objective to all of what we're trying to accomplish.

170
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,810
CHARLES: Absolutely, Vint. At a deeper level,
design matters, right? So having a good accessible

171
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,149
design or at least a design that can be made
accessible is key. We can do all the technical

172
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,310
fixes we want to, but that's not going to
compensate for a really bad design if you

173
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,110
start with that.
VINT: Exactly right.

174
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:07,519
EVE: So how can people do accessible design?
CHARLES: I think it's about thinking through

175
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:13,089
your entire workflow and making it so that
there are multiple ways of approaching it

176
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,479
and multiple ways of getting through it. So,
for example, you don't really want to build

177
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:20,689
a program that says you must use a mouse to
drive it.

178
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,179
EVE: Mmhmm
CHARLES: Instead, think of the task, right?

179
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:27,939
Something as simple as, say, a drag-and-drop
operation. If you made it so that the only

180
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:33,450
way to add something was via drag and drop,
then you have a serious accessibility problem.

181
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,559
Because for a user with physical impairments
who can't use a mouse, or for a blind user

182
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:43,220
who wouldn't be able to use a mouse and aim
it properly, it will not work for that audience.

183
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,369
However, if you expanded &mdash; if you took a step
back and thought about the problem you're

184
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:52,109
trying to solve, which is to get the user
intent of: they take something from bucket

185
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:57,090
A and they're moving it into bucket B; if
you then think of the problem in that sense,

186
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,009
then you have a lot of options open. Because
then it doesn't necessarily have to be drag-and-drop.

187
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:05,940
Drag-and-drop is one of the ways of moving
something from A into B, but you could also

188
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,259
do it by keyboard by selecting it first and
then doing a cut-and-paste operation. So really

189
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:15,639
it's about thinking through the problem that
you're trying to solve and then thinking through

190
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:20,289
multiple ways of letting the user indicate
what they wish to do and conveying the results

191
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:24,649
back to the user and not forcing them into
just one mode of doing things.

192
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:29,879
VINT: Do you suppose now that we're beginning
to see computers getting better and better

193
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:36,149
and actually understanding speech, that we
will get into a more conversational interaction

194
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:40,039
with some of these applications so we can
actually tell it what it is we're trying to

195
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:43,350
accomplish and have it figure out the best
way to do that?

196
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,649
CHARLES: I certainly hope so. That's one of
the things that I think is really cool about

197
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:52,919
technologies like Google Now and some of the
things that we've shown off at Google I/O.

198
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:58,159
The nice thing, too, is I think we really
want to think a step ahead of just the computer

199
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:04,269
doing exactly what the user said, but rather
having some level of anticipation and assistance

200
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,879
so that the user doesn't necessarily have
to mechanically go through every individual

201
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:15,350
step, but rather have a smoother workflow
where they can perform a task and have efficient

202
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,259
task completions.
EVE: From what you describe, Charles, it sounds

203
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:23,970
like doing things that help people with accessibility
needs has the potential to help everybody

204
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,179
streamline what they're doing on the computer.
CHARLES: Bingo.

205
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,539
VINT: That's a really good point.
CHARLES: And that's really something that

206
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:31,450
I think everyone should strive for.
EVE: Thank you.

207
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,830
CHARLES: Thanks, Eve.
EVE: So jumping up one level, I want to come

208
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:42,830
back to something, Vint, that you touched
on earlier. You mentioned, in other words,

209
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,830
that the internet is supposed to level the
playing field for everyone. Can you comment

210
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,379
a little bit more on that?
VINT: Well, I think as Charles has just demonstrated,

211
00:19:55,379 --> 00:20:01,769
the internet is filled with boulders and mountains
that have to be either climbed or moved in

212
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:06,950
order to make it - moved, preferably - to
make it a really level playing field. What

213
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:13,279
I found most interesting about Charles' demonstration
is the level of detail with which you have

214
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,359
to think in order to imagine what your software
is going to be like for someone who's blind.

215
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,970
You have to similarly try to think your way
through what happens if you have a user who's

216
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:30,479
deaf or has some other impairment. What I
think is fundamental here - and the reason

217
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:35,649
it's important for this class to be taken
by everyone who's interested in making web

218
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:42,649
experiences useful for everyone - is the degree
to which you have to imagine how this is going

219
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:49,249
to behave for someone who needs assistance.
This is all about harnessing the computer

220
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:55,789
power that we know is in those boxes to help
someone who needs a little bit of assistance

221
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:02,059
to experience the web in a way that is needed
for that particular person. The thing I want

222
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:09,059
to emphasize here is the diversity of assistance
needs. It's not a simple thing to say, "I

223
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,909
will do it this way for anyone who has a vision
impairment, and I'll do it this way for someone

224
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:21,909
who has an audio problem." In fact, every
single person with one of these variable challenges

225
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:28,269
may need different nuances - different kinds
of assistance. And so we need a lot of flexibility

226
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:33,789
built into this environment. It's also, I
think, very important not to imagine that

227
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:40,149
you can build a web application and then somehow
sprinkle accessibility pixie dust on it and

228
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:44,979
have it work. It's much more fundamental than
that, and that's why this class is so important.

229
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:51,979
So I want to encourage everyone who has a
desire to make their web pages and their other

230
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:59,419
applications accessible to everyone, to take
this class, absorb what you learn from it,

231
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:06,979
and then apply it. Because that will, in fact,
make the internet be for everyone.

232
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,419
EVE: Thank you for watching. This is the end
of our GDL on our new course, Introduction

233
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:19,349
to Web Accessibility. To close us out, Vint,
what should people watching this GDL do next?

234
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:26,349
VINT: That's easy. Sign up for the class,
take it, absorb it, and apply it!
