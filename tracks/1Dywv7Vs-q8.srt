00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,200
NAT DUCA: Everybody wants a nice
smooth web app, a nice

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,630
smooth browsing experience.

4
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,980
But actually doing
that is a really,

5
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,960
really difficult problem.

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,650
And so what we're going to be
doing at Chrome summit is both

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,090
listening to the kinds
of problems

8
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,400
that users are having &mdash;

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,660
that's why we want everybody
to come &mdash;

10
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,450
and also showing how to
architect your app to be jank

11
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,800
free in the first place and also
how to use our tools to

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,620
figure out what's broken when
things do go wrong.

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,780
We know that this is hard, but
what we don't know is the

14
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,110
kinds of looks that people want
to implement and where

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,730
our tooling falls over.

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,090
So when you come to us with a
piece of content, we want to

17
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,300
look at it and see where the
tools work, where the tools

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,620
don't work, and what kinds of
things we should be building

19
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,500
into Chrome in the future
to make that look

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,580
even better for you.

21
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,280
I'm Nat Duca.

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
I'm one of Chrome's
graphics hackers.

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,650
I look forward to busting jank
with you at the summit.

24
00:00:52,650 --> 00:01:03,065
