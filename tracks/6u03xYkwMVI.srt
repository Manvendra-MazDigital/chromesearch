00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,832

2
00:00:03,832 --> 00:00:06,460
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much, Andrew.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,930
So, folks, we have the
privilege, the challenge,

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,540
and the &mdash; well, yes,
it is a challenge &mdash;

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,440
of having a very
broadly scoped topic,

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,020
but we're going to be
exciting, lively, and vibrant,

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,100
and we need you.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,720
We need you to
participate in that.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,210
So lots of interaction,
please, from everybody.

10
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,510
Let me introduce my
panel, first of all.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,770
I'm going from the right here.

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,360
We have Andrew Spooner, who's
UX Evangelist at Microsoft.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,110
We have Jeni Tennison, who is
CTO at the Open Data Institute.

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,700
To my left, we
have Scott Jenson,

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,810
who does user
experience at Google.

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,030
And who's next?

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,050
Oh, it's Tom over there.

18
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,340
Tom Ashworth is a front-end
developer over at Twitter.

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,060
And Alice on the end there
does user experience stuff

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,600
for the government
digital service.

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,089
I think we are &mdash;

22
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:03,330
ALICE: Well, I'm front-end
developer at [INAUDIBLE]

23
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,590
MALE SPEAKER: I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,350
Carried away in
my own excitement.

25
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,670
We'll probably cover some
things that have already

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,086
been covered today,
but I'm hoping

27
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:16,590
we'll cover them from a
slightly different perspective.

28
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,100
So we've already
talked, for example,

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,090
about varying device
sizes and so on.

30
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,930
But we are looking for
broadening that topic out,

31
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,430
I guess, and looking
to future case.

32
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,170
Remember, we're talking
about the future,

33
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,714
so every opinion is valid.

34
00:01:32,714 --> 00:01:33,380
[LIGHT LAUGHTER]

35
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,600
Well, nearly every opinion.

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,220

37
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,110
I'm trying hard to let go of
that reference to being older

38
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,230
than Meg.

39
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,720
What do you think?

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,623
SCOTT JENSON: Actually,
is Gareth here?

41
00:01:48,623 --> 00:01:50,839
Is he still here, the
guy who said that?

42
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:51,880
AUDIENCE: No, he ran off.

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,921
SCOTT JENSON: He ran off.

44
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,350
Well, collectively,
everyone here that's over 37

45
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,258
would wish to say,
just fuck you.

46
00:01:57,258 --> 00:02:03,110
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

47
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,524
MALE SPEAKER: Just to
verify my own antiquity,

48
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:07,190
I want to make sure
that you understand.

49
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,400
My first build system
was, in fact, a shoe box,

50
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,636
which helped me to keep
the punched cards in order.

51
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:20,047
[LAUGHTER]

52
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:22,630
The other thing I want to say
in this rather lengthy preamble,

53
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,420
before I introduce
you to Jeni, is

54
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,730
that you've heard
people say, when they've

55
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,230
been asked to ask
their questions,

56
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,120
oh, this isn't what I wrote.

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,670
I'm expecting that quite a few
people who I call on will say,

58
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,590
I have no idea what
this even means.

59
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,120
It bears no relation whatsoever
to what I wrote down.

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,980
Now this is not &mdash;
we did actually

61
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,595
try to keep it
thematically coherent,

62
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:47,670
so the people who are
asking the questions

63
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,029
may have some words in
there &mdash; Dan's nodding there.

64
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:52,820
There are some words
in your question, Dan,

65
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,852
that you did originally write.

66
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:56,800
[LAUGHTER]

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,270
Not next to each other,
and not in the same order.

68
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,960
Right, so Jeni, Jeni, can you
please tell us, when next?

69
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,930
JENI TENNISON: OK.

70
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,730
So can I have my
slides up, please?

71
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:14,525

72
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:17,140
This, no, maybe
it's not plugged in.

73
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:25,240

74
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
It's on the screen here.

75
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,656
It's just not on
the screen there.

76
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:29,854

77
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:31,270
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
do you need to &mdash;

78
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,700
JENI TENNISON: Maybe
this is not plugged in?

79
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,533
MALE SPEAKER: Ah, yeah,
it's not plugged in.

80
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:49,580

81
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,080
[INAUDIBLE]

82
00:03:50,080 --> 00:04:14,160

83
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,899
JENI TENNISON:
Thank you, Derrick.

84
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,230
Great, sorry for
that slight delay.

85
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,680
Right, so the
topic of future web

86
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,090
is a rather broad one &mdash;
the future being very much

87
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,310
longer than the past.

88
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,832
Hopefully.

89
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:33,770
[LAUGHTER] Oh god,
what have I done there?

90
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,840
Touch wood, right.

91
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,110
So thinking about the
future web &mdash; obviously,

92
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,210
the first person to ask
about where the web might go

93
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,584
would be &mdash; Chrome, come on.

94
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:51,160
[INAUDIBLE] This is not good.

95
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,840
OK.

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,750
JENI TENNISON: I think
I might need to use it.

98
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,150
This is using
reveal.js, by the way.

99
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,684
Thank you.

need the future faster.

do need the future faster.

115
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,784
Oh, it's not up on
the screen, now.

116
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:49,337
Here we go.

117
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:50,420
JENI TENNISON: Okey-dokey.

118
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,126
Right.

So let's ask TimBL, now.

122
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,320
Of course, thinking
about asking TimBL

123
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,220
what the future of the
web holds &mdash; of course,

124
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,950
he did his Ask Me
Anything on Reddit,

125
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,410
where he asked what
was one of the things

126
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,510
that you never anticipated
about the internet,

127
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,310
and famously replied, kittens!

128
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,134
So, in terms of
predicting what's

129
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:14,550
going to happen
in the future web,

130
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,340
I can predict that
there will still

131
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,560
be kittens on the
web &mdash; and pussies, too.

[GRADUALLY MOUNTING LAUGHTER]

133
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:29,230
But &mdash; I want to focus on
three themes, three trends,

134
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,190
that I think are going to be
important as we go forward

135
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,410
as web developers, and look
at those in terms of what that

136
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,810
means for us when we're
developing web applications.

137
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,860
Those three themes
are going to be

138
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,460
more sensitivity around our
personal information, more data

139
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,220
being available, and as we've
touched on many times today,

140
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,480
more devices.

141
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,500
So, more sensitivity,
first of all.

142
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,080
Ed Snowden.

143
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,020

144
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,960
One of the things that
has happened recently

145
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,610
that has changed the way in
which we think about the web is

146
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,110
the revelations
around the Ed Snowden

147
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,350
came about what the
NSA is looking at,

148
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,450
what GCHQ is looking at.

149
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,935
And I found this on
Wikipedia, fantastic

added and removed here.

151
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,250
This is the stuff
that we can get into,

152
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,350
guys, at the back end of Google,
where there's no encryption

153
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,190
and we have free reign.

154
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,890
What does this mean
in terms of how

155
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,220
we design our systems,
our web applications?

156
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,140
What does it mean in terms
of these revelations,

157
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,580
this thinking about where our
private information is going?

158
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,610
What does that mean for us?

159
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,910
Well, there's loads of policy
implications, loads of things

160
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,870
that we can think of at a
legislative level, or a policy

161
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,590
level.

162
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,880
But there are also
some technical ones.

163
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,760

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,260
I'm on the technical
architecture group at the W3C,

165
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,000
and one of the things that
has come up several times

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,590
without any kind of resolution
or in-depth thinking

167
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,090
is what we do around
permissions on the web.

168
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,370
How do we balance the need for
you to know that you are being

169
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,690
looked at through your
video camera on your laptop,

170
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,290
with it not being so much
in your face that you cannot

interact with whatever
the application is?

172
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,130
How do we balance up
the need to request,

on a case-by-case
basis, information

174
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,679
about your location,
with the irritation

175

of being requested on
a case-by-case basis

176
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,690
about your location?

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,730
How do we get around
these terrible kinds

178
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,290
of permission interfaces
that everybody

179
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,140
just clicks through and ignores?

180
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,290
Everybody being
everybody who doesn't

181
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,600
wear a tin foil hat, that is.

182
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,950
So that's one set of questions.

183
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,380
How do we handle
those permissions

184
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,530
when we have lots of
ways of tracking us?

185
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,200
Another area that
I wanted to raise

186
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,550
was, how do we move away from
these centralized services that

187
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:17,370
are so vulnerable to a single
point of failure, if you like,

188
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,320
in our private data?

189
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,290
So I'm particularly interested
in a couple of activities

190
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,980
that are going on around this &mdash;
around unhosted web apps.

191
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,850
The idea of having a web
application over here

192
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,370
that operates on data
over here, and you

193
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,170
can control how your data
gets accessed by that web app.

194
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,540
It doesn't actually hold
all your data itself.

195
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,920
And also the work
of Redecentralize,

196
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,860
which explores a
lot of these issues,

197
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,070
and I've encouraged
you to have a look at.

198
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,000
How do we get to a web that
isn't as centralized as it

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,920
currently is, because
of these sensitivities

200
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,500
that we have about
our personal data

201
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,310
being collected in
huge databases which

202
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,620
are vulnerable to attack?

203
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,410
So that was my first area.

204
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,970
Second area is about data.

205
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,860
Now, so far during
the day, the focus

206
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,350
has really been on what happens
within a browser context.

207
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,580
Where I work, at the Open Data
Institute, all I hear about

208
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,340
is data.

209
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,330
All I hear about is
smart cities and the data

210
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,460
that you can get from
devices and sensors

211
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,065
within a road network
in smart cities.

212
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:29,870
This is Smart City
logo land, right?

213
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,610
We talk about home automation
and the extra information

214
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,420
we can get about our homes'
interactions with home systems,

215
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,140
sensors &mdash; more data coming
in from our home systems.

216
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,980
We talk about quantified
self &mdash; wearable computing that

217
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,200
monitors us constantly,
that provides

218
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,320
streams and streams of data.

219
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,585
We talk about open
data, naturally,

220
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:56,200
at the Open Data
Institute, more government

221
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,720
data being made available.

222
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,270
Also, from companies,
data being made available

223
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,560
that we can all use.

224
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,530
We talk about big
data, massive amounts

225
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,770
of fast-moving, variable data.

226
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,280
I love the way that, in
my search for big data &mdash;

227
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,290
see that McDonald's sign?

228
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,790
Why?

229
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,940
I don't know.

230
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,510
Anyway, data.

231
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,610
So, we talk about medical
data, defense data, decadata,

232
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,590
whatever that is.

233
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,830
Morning data, noon data,
afternoon data, and night data.

234
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,190
Everything is data.

235
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,260
So, what does this
mean for the web, when

236
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,820
we have so much more
data being passed around?

237
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,990
So much more streaming
data, so much more big data.

238
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,080
HTTP, as a protocol, is not
good for this kind of streaming.

239
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,920
It's not good for these
kinds of big files.

240
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,100
So what other
protocols are we using?

241
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,330
What other protocols do we need?

242
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:52,221
And how do we make them
play nicely with the web?

243
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:57,900
How do we make them play well
with HTML pages and HTTP?

244
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,740
The web was made
for docu &mdash; ments.

245
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,380
[CHUCKLES]

246
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,650
So is JSON the pinnacle
of data on the web?

247
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:13,270
Is Jason really all that we need
for expressing data on the web?

248
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,591
I don't think so.

249
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,090
The other question
I'd like to raise

250
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:22,060
is what does a native
data browser look like?

251
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,710
What happens currently when you
have data that's made available

252
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,580
on the web is that you have
to create your own component,

253
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,180
your own kind of visualization.

254
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,920
We have things like this, which
are data tables, JavaScript

255
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,450
plugin, that makes everything &mdash;
that streams data in,

256
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,250
that makes it sortable,
filterable, pageable,

257
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,080
and so on.

258
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,910
But what about moving to more
integrated data and documents,

259
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,640
using the kinds of
technologies within D3?

260
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,140
What does this mean
for us on the web?

261
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,549
What kinds of components?

262
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:01,090
What kinds of web
components could we

263
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,545
build that natively
work with data?

264
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,170
Those are the kinds
of questions that I

265
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,160
think are interesting
for the future.

266
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,820
Third area &mdash; more devices.

267
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,800
This is the area that we've
touched on loads today.

268
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:23,260
So we have a browser that's
stopped working again.

269
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,210
Come on.

270
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,740
More devices.

271
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,600
Give me it.

272
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,561
Come on.

273
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:33,046
[INAUDIBLE]

274
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,528

275
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:36,028
[INAUDIBLE]

276
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:39,520

277
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,640
JENI TENNISON: OK, so we have
more devices that don't work.

278
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,525
Oh, that is completely
interaction.

279
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,340

280
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,340
[INAUDIBLE]

281
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,340
[LAUGHTER]

282
00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:13,819

283
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,610
DERRICK: Do you know
what number it was at?

284
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,295
JENI TENNISON: Yeah, it's fine.

285
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:16,795
It's fine.

286
00:14:16,795 --> 00:14:18,860
I know how to get to it quickly.

287
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,170
OK.

288
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,772
More devices.

289
00:14:21,772 --> 00:14:22,272
Hey!

290
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:24,250
[APPLAUSE]

291
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:24,750
All right!

292
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,720

293
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:36,250
Phones, tablets &mdash; yes, that's a
Windows tablet &mdash; TVs, watches,

294
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,095
fridges, cars.

295
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,770

296
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,020
And all of these devices have
differences in their size,

297
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,930
in their resolution,
in their connectivity,

298
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,240
in their processing power, in
their modes of interaction &mdash;

299
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,310
as we've already talked about &mdash;
and in their context of use.

300
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:02,550
Huge variety, massive variety,
of ways in which we as humans

301
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,090
will interact with the web.

302
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,652

303
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:09,860
And of course that means
that we need this responsive

304
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,500
design plus plus, right?

305
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,920
Not only responsive
layout, but responsive

306
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,660
images, responsive
interactions, changing

307
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,270
based on the
devices that we use.

308
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,310
Responsive storage &mdash;
different ways

309
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,510
of storing the
information, and knowing

310
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:28,360
whether you're going to go on
and offline intermittently,

311
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,650
or whether you're going to have
a constant internet connection,

312
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,520
for example, will
change the way in which

313
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,485
we design our web applications.

314
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:39,280

315
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,790
Right, and a final thought.

316
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,950
We're currently dominated by
four particular web browsers,

317
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,545
and fewer rendering engines.

318
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:53,125

319
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:53,880
[INAUDIBLE]

320
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
JENI TENNISON: Well, OK.

321
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,592
[LAUGHTER]

322
00:15:57,592 --> 00:15:59,910
And perhaps we should be
dominated by one more,

323
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,840
yeah all right.

324
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,025
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Blink.

325
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:02,950
JENI TENNISON:
[LAUGHS] It is Blink.

326
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,050
It's the same &mdash; same
rendering engine.

327
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:09,910
So, my closing question
would be are we agile enough?

328
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,620
Right?

329
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,990
Have we got enough
small pieces loosely

330
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,060
joined to enable us to adjust
to the changing future?

331
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,480
Can the web that we
know be disrupted

332
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,580
by the next best
thing, or have we

333
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:29,620
built something that is
too big to be taken down?

334
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,988
Thank you.

335
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:33,832
[APPLAUSE]

336
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:36,794

MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much, Jeni.

338
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,280
I anticipate a future in which
Jeni will give her presentation

339
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,784
using web technology with fewer
than three different browsers.

340
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:47,095
[LAUGHTER]

341
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:51,160
But I don't expect
it will come soon.

342
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,240
Right.

343
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,150
Jeni, thank you, that was great.

344
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,910
And hopefully we can
follow up on some

345
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,980
of your themes through
some of the questions

346
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,700
that we have put
through the wringer.

347
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,310
For the final time today,
at least in this role,

348
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,569
I'm going to call
on Andrew Betts &mdash;

349
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,847
this time to read a question
that he had nothing to do with.

350
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:12,680
ANDREW BETTS: That it's
very true, actually.

351
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,260
And I have no more
questions, I promise you.

352
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,380
What is the role of the web
in the world of wearables

353
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,686
with no screen?

354
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,060
MALE SPEAKER: OK,
so the question

355
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,790
is what is the role of the
web in a world with wearables

356
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,430
but no screen?

357
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,450
This is a reference to the
fact that the web is primarily

358
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,580
a visual thing &mdash; in
its output, at least.

359
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,800
We've talked about
different input modalities.

360
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,425
What about different
output modalities?

361
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:37,301
Jeni, do you want to
kick us off on this one?

362
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:39,341
JENI TENNISON: [BREATHES DEEPLY]
Just recovering.

363
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:40,666
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, I'm sorry.

364
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,624
JENI TENNISON: It's OK.

365
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:43,910
MALE SPEAKER: Jeni, calm down.

366
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,770
JENI TENNISON: So,
it's one of my bugbears

367
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,970
that we focus on browsers.

368
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,260
We focus on screens,
and we don't

369
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:02,110
think about the other ways
in which all sorts of agents

370
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,420
might interact on the web.

371
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,930
And I think wearables is just
one kind of example of this,

372
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,790
but there are lots of
other kinds of agents

373
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,940
that we need to
be thinking about,

374
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,620
and understand that they
live on the web, too.

375
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,115
And they consume
web content, too.

376
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:22,740

377
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,010
And so, wearables &mdash; you've got
a difference in input modality,

378
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,030
but you've also got a difference
in output modality, which

379
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:36,050
I think changes the way in which
we need to think about how we

380
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,650
design our pages in the
same way as we talked

381
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,930
about accessibility issues
in the last session.

382
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,290
Sorry that wasn't very &mdash;

383
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:43,970
MALE SPEAKER: No,
that was great.

384
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,580
Thank you.

385
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,517
Alice, I know that
you've done a lot of work

386
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:47,850
on the internet of things, yeah?

387
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,350
ALICE: Yeah.

388
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,700
MALE SPEAKER: How does this
strike you in that context?

389
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,610
ALICE: Well, I think
the web is going

390
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,670
to continue in the
way it currently

391
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,570
does in a world without
screens, because, as Jeni said,

392
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,120
there are already plenty of
things that don't have screens.

393
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,490
And there'll be new things
that don't have screens,

394
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,270
and some of those will be
objects that we currently

395
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,310
understand &mdash; like watches &mdash; that
have a sort additional &mdash; have

396
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,190
been elevated by having
the web put into them.

397
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,900
But then, there might be
some completely new invented

398
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,230
things &mdash; a middle ground
that you would never

399
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,680
have thought about
before you were

400
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,090
able to put the web into stuff.

401
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,950
And there are &mdash; I
used work for Berg,

402
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,262
and so we made Little
Printer, and we made a mistake

403
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:37,220
by calling it Little
Printer, because it's not.

404
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,770
Well, it is a printer,
but that's not

405
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,760
it's primary function, and
you would never really want

406
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,827
Little Printer
without the internet.

407
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:46,660
And in that way, it's
sort of a new product,

408
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,210
rather than an internet
fridge or something like that.

409
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,960
But Little Printer
doesn't have a screen,

410
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,150
unless you count
the receipts paper

411
00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:01,100
that it prints on as a
screen, which we mischievously

412
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,154
say it is sometimes.

413
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:04,570
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for that.

414
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,420
Go ahead, Scott.

415
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,113
SCOTT JENSON: If I
could just poke fun

416
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:07,530
at the community a
little bit, though.

417
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,130
Because right now, I don't think
that the web community even

418
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,379
could get its head wrapped
around the web on a watch &mdash;

419
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,750
let alone a web not
on a screen at all.

420
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,920
I think the web has never
recovered from the fact

421
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,620
that screens started
getting smaller.

422
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,110
They continually got bigger,
and basically just &mdash; maybe

423
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,810
they just didn't
worry about things.

424
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,310
And then when it
reversed direction,

425
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,070
we collectively lost our minds.

426
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,300
And we still haven't
recovered from that.

427
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,600
And so this idea that
we have to have one size

428
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,450
fits all works great,
as long as you're

429
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,970
willing to scroll
everything 20 pages.

430
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,390
But if you want to have &mdash;
I hate to get into the web

431
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,425
app versus web page thing,
because it's a waste of &mdash; you

432
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:42,530
know.

433
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,120
But the fact is
that we are trying

434
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,890
to make things that
are more interactive,

435
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,999
and the web has not got its head
wrapped around that quite yet.

436
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,040
And so I do think we have
a lot of soul-searching

437
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,540
to do to figure out
what interaction

438
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,470
means on multiple devices.

439
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,650
MALE SPEAKER: OK, and so to
summarize some of the points

440
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,445
here, what we're saying
is, we haven't even

441
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:00,820
got to grips with
what we've got.

442
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,780
But I would come
back and say, hey,

443
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,360
but you haven't
seen anything yet.

444
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,440
So we'd better hurry up
and make up our minds

445
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,600
about what we're gonna do.

446
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,550
I can see Remy on the queue.

447
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,229
Let me take Remy and
come back to you.

448
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:18,935

449
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:20,851
REMY: Yes, this
is kind of linked

450
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:23,100
to the question I
had before, but you

451
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,710
mentioned how to [INAUDIBLE].

452
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,700
I don't get how my
phone is of the web.

453
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,680
It could &mdash; it can, I
think, talk over TCP IP,

454
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,620
and it can talk to a web server,
but in a proprietary format.

455
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,180
There's no webiness
that I can see there.

456
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,200
There's no way of
me getting into it.

457
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,120
MALE SPEAKER: Right, I'm
going to cut you off there,

458
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,536
because we're going to come
back to this as a topic later.

459
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:50,905
So I'll let you back in there.

460
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:51,610
[INAUDIBLE]

461
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,610
MALE SPEAKER: Fascinating
though your point was,

462
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,980
we will be coming back to it.

463
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,050
Does it qualify as
a web device is not

464
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,260
a purely syntactic
argument, I don't think.

465
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,130
Tom?

466
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,160
TOM ASHWORTH: I think
we, as a web community,

467
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,710
have good things to
say to the people who

468
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,560
are building these
wearable devices.

469
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,810
We may not be able to put
our technology stuck on them.

470
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,030
So, you know, you're not
going to find a headless web

471
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,700
browser running on
a Fitbit, but we

472
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,190
can say if you make
URLable resources

473
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,694
available and connected
to each other,

474
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:21,860
we know that's a good thing.

475
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,720
We can point out
to the people who

476
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,760
are building these
things that that

477
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,630
has some really
positive benefits.

478
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,850
And if we give things URLs
and we make them addressable

479
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:37,890
and we make them accessible,
even if it's JSON and not HTML,

480
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,432
but we use the
principles of the web,

481
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:40,848
and to some extent,
the internet &mdash;

482
00:22:40,848 --> 00:22:43,180
then I think we can have
a really positive impact,

483
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,855
as the web community,
on whatever comes

484
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:48,480
over the next few years in terms
of wearable devices and things

485
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,074
that don't have screens.

486
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:52,490
MALE SPEAKER: OK, Andrew.

487
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,850
ANDREW SPOONER: Yeah, I
think inherent to the web

488
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,017
is the presentation format.

489
00:22:58,017 --> 00:22:59,850
That presentation that
says think of the web

490
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,410
without a screen I think
is a little bit weird.

491
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,604
JENI TENNISON: Completely
disagree, but carry on.

492
00:23:04,604 --> 00:23:05,770
ANDREW SPOONER: That's good.

493
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,845
[LAUGHTER]

494
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,470
MALE SPEAKER: You
yourself were talking

495
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,650
about music and
notation and so on.

496
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,010
What's wrong with
a web of music.

497
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,037
Nothing's wrong
with a web of music,

498
00:23:16,037 --> 00:23:17,870
but I think where we've
got all of this data

499
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,860
in a particular format
that we can access,

500
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,590
and we can use web languages
in order to talk to data

501
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,750
and in order to talk to
devices, but I don't see it

502
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,466
as the web on those devices.

503
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:28,890
MALE SPEAKER: Jeni, go on.

504
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,030
JENI TENNISON: So,
the reason I disagree

505
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:36,800
is that for me, the main
definition of the web

506
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,990
is use of HTTP.

507
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,270
It isn't the use of HTML.

508
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,920
And if you count
the use of HTTP,

509
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,120
you can be sending
data over HTTP,

510
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,870
which needn't be shown
on a screen, which

511
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,510
could be interacted with
through a wearable device

512
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,360
or in any other kind of way.

513
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,460
If we tie the web
as only being HTML,

514
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,065
I think we make a mistake.

515
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:04,940
ANDREW SPOONER: Yeah.

516
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,570
And I'm not getting
into the protocols,

517
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,230
but what the web is to
me &mdash; it has a presentation,

518
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,319
and it's something very visual.

519
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,860
But we can certainly
use the content,

520
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,484
and we can use the
languages that we've

521
00:24:16,484 --> 00:24:19,977
got in order to
interact with devices.

522
00:24:19,977 --> 00:24:21,310
But maybe we're getting crossed.

523
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,020
MALE SPEAKER: Right, OK, I
think we could continue on this,

524
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,040
and I'm very sorry to put
these on the queue here.

525
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,110
But we are going to move
on to the next topic

526
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,640
now, because we've
got too much to cover.

527
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,700
We just have.

528
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,270
I'm going to call, again &mdash;
possibly for the final time

529
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,000
today &mdash; Christopher, you've
been an active participant.

530
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,640
I hope I didn't mangle your
question beyond your ability

531
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,190
to read it.

532
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,770

533
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,275
CHRISTOPHER: Yes, if you'll
allow me to just preface

534
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:52,580
this &mdash; the reason I'm
asking this question

535
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,490
is I've actually recently
had experience with this.

536
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,250
But also, when we
talk about the future,

537
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,020
we focus a little bit too
much on the text side,

538
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,353
and not about the audience side.

539
00:24:59,353 --> 00:25:01,472
So basically my question
is, the future of the web

540
00:25:01,472 --> 00:25:03,180
will see a rising
important in automizing

541
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,929
[INAUDIBLE] with Eastern
China and working

542
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:06,322
with their national firewall.

543
00:25:06,322 --> 00:25:08,405
Many popular embeddable
services, such as YouTube,

544
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:09,486
are blocked over there.

545
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:12,000
How do we accommodate different
nationalities' to privacy,

546
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,925
sensitive content, and
inappropriate content,

547
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:14,570
and so on.

548
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,765
And there's also the
technological barriers

549
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,020
to think about as well.

550
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,980
MALE SPEAKER: Jeni, I'm going to
ask you to leap in here again,

551
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,250
because this is, I think,
directly keying off

552
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,837
one of your principle points.

553
00:25:27,837 --> 00:25:29,420
JENI TENNISON: And
I think it was also

554
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,050
because nobody else wanted to
touch it with a barge pole.

555
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,010
[LAUGHTER]

556
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:41,230
So, on the internet,
then the typical way

557
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,250
in which we move
around those barriers

558
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,470
is that we subvert them.

559
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,650
That tends to be what happens.

560
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:52,760
We tend to work around
those kinds of issues.

561
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,010
And I don't have
direct experience

562
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,985
of the issues in China.

563
00:25:56,985 --> 00:25:58,620
I can't really speak to them.

564
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:04,940
I think that the issues about
how we internationally come up

565
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:11,940
with some kind of understanding
about how &mdash; when we have lots

566
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,790
of different laws
around privacy,

567
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,340
around data
protection, and so on,

568
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,720
how we internationally
handle that

569
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,300
is a very interesting question.

570
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,700
I've seen people
from Africa talk

571
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,800
about wanting to have
legislation in their countries

572
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,730
that explicitly
precludes anybody looking

573
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,790
at data within servers
that are in their countries

574
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,930
to make them a more attractive
option for people who

575
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,820
are building web applications
to use servers in their country,

576
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,990
for example.

577
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,190
So we might start
to see an arms race

578
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,770
between different
nationalities as they

579
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,280
try to provide a
more interesting web

580
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,762
environment for
people to use &mdash; maybe.

581
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:58,345
The other kinds of
things that I think

582
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:00,520
are interesting to
think about &mdash; what

583
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,810
TimBL said at the 25th
anniversary of the web just

584
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,230
the other week.

585
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,956
Talking about a Bill of
Rights for internet users &mdash;

586
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:13,080
whether we should have a
right to use the internet,

587
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,850
whether we should
have a right to use it

588
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,270
with particular levels of
understanding about what

589
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,550
our privacy should
be, what access

590
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,470
we should have to
content on the web.

591
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,500
Or the other kind of idea that
I've heard floating around

592
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,110
is whether we should
have a Geneva Convention

593
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,540
type of thing, where we
know that there are going

594
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,970
to be states that
block us from accessing

595
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,050
certain kinds of content.

596
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,810
But should we have an
international understanding

597
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,440
about the limits
of that blocking

598
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,100
that we internationally
agree on?

599
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,360
I think these are all really
interesting questions.

600
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,967
And I think that we're only
at the beginning of starting

601
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:53,675
to have those
conversations, particularly

602
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:55,810
with policy makers,
who really don't

603
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,780
understand any of this at all.

604
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,460
MALE SPEAKER: And that's
quite scary, really, isn't it?

605
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,918
TOM ASHWORTH: I think we also
have to look at this question

606
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:04,920
from another point of
view, which is &mdash; actually,

607
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,310
this is a moot point
if the web is not

608
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,352
viable in any
particular country.

609
00:28:10,352 --> 00:28:12,810
So, for example, in &mdash; I won't
call them developing nations,

610
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,250
because their economies
are bigger than the UK's.

611
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,280
But in countries like Brazil &mdash;
or, say, China or India &mdash;

612
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,890
we have to ask, is
the web actually

613
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,480
a viable platform
there at the moment?

614
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,137
If I, for example, worked
for a social network,

615
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:30,720
and let's say I work for
Facebook and I want to &mdash;

616
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,560
[LAUGHTER]

617
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:38,230
And I want to get more
users in a country like one

618
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,840
of the ones I just
mentioned, I've

619
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,620
got a range of technologies
that are available to me.

620
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,750
And honestly, as web people,
we have to say, you know what?

621
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,540
The web does not
win in that battle.

622
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,960
Native wins in that battle.

623
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,710
Low-powered Android
wins that battle.

624
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,930
[GROANS]

625
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,990
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, dear.

626
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,620
No, hmm.

627
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,316
TOM ASHWORTH: And I'll give
you Firefox as well, but &mdash;

628
00:28:59,316 --> 00:29:00,310
[CHUCKLES]

629
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:04,360
But you have to admit that,
I think, for a big company,

630
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,252
if you're going to invest
in a technology right now,

631
00:29:08,252 --> 00:29:09,960
low-powered Android
phones &mdash; particularly

632
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,560
if you're heading
into those markets &mdash;

633
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,770
are a very good option.

634
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,150
We are missing certain key
elements of the technology

635
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,317
stack that will enable us to
make gains in those places.

636
00:29:20,317 --> 00:29:22,400
There were quite a few
questions in the moderator,

637
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,115
actually, about &mdash;

638
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:24,990
MALE SPEAKER: I'm going
to cut you off there,

639
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,070
because I think that you've
done your advertising spiel.

640
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,330
Thank you very much for that.

641
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,690
Can we go to Robert
Daly, who's on the queue?

642
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,880

643
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,560
ROBERT DALY: Hi.

644
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,510
We currently think of
one device, one user.

645
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,740
But with car OSes and
basically giant touch

646
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,760
screens that will have multiple
users using the same app

647
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,440
at the same time, how
do we deal with, say,

648
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,750
a driver and a passenger
using the same app in a car

649
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,600
at the same time without
switching user accounts?

650
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,230
Or &mdash; as in, how do we deal with
multiple people interacting

651
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,442
with the web?

652
00:30:00,442 --> 00:30:01,525
MALE SPEAKER: Or, indeed &mdash;

653
00:30:01,525 --> 00:30:03,501
ROBERT DALY: On one device.

654
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,500
MALE SPEAKER: Single
people on multiple devices.

655
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,800
That's the other side
to that proposition.

656
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,040
Do you want to take
that one, Scott?

657
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,680
SCOTT JENSON: I
actually would add

658
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,680
that I feel like that's exactly
the issue the web has right

659
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,940
now &mdash; it's that we've
been so enamored with one

660
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,560
device and one screen that
that's just our entire myopia.

661
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
I would go even further
that that one screen has

662
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,101
to, by the way, look
and feel as much

663
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:22,330
like an iPhone as possible.

664
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,780
I'm being a little
editorial at that point.

665
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,540
But I do think
that the web needs

666
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,315
to be exploring these
kinds of things.

667
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:30,440
So what would it mean to
have something on my watch

668
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,640
which then entices me
to pull out my phone

669
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
and allows me, then, to
continue the experience.

670
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,440
I don't think we're
considering that.

671
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,856
And it's something
that frankly, I

672
00:30:37,856 --> 00:30:40,880
think the web is most
powerful at playing with.

673
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,710
MALE SPEAKER: OK, sorry, I'm
gonna have to skip to Guy,

674
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,797
and then we'll move
on to the next topic.

675
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:48,005
GUY: I just want to get back
to the country question,

676
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:51,190
and say that I don't think
it's a foregone conclusion

677
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,602
that the web needs to
adapt to those countries.

678
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,310
I think, to a large
extent, the countries

679
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,500
need to adapt to the web.

680
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,940
And it's sort of a force
to be reckoned with,

681
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,773
and Twitter and other
platforms have already

682
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:03,620
demonstrated that multiple
times over the past few years.

683
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,177
I think that when you talk
about the future of the web,

684
00:31:06,177 --> 00:31:08,260
it's very much possible
that the future of the web

685
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,210
is the openness of it, and
it's kind of the government's

686
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,918
problem to sort of
figure out how do they

687
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:13,620
navigate within that world?

688
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,170
So the intent is about
getting data from one place

689
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:20,144
to the other, privacy concerns
around that, et cetera.

690
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,810
ANDREW SPOONER: Yeah,
I agree with that.

691
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,560
MALE SPEAKER: I'm really
sorry, but we were actually

692
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,610
going to go light on the
allotted time for that,

693
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,480
but we've run out of time on
it, despite thinking we were not

694
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,236
going to spend as much
on it as we might.

695
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:31,750
Oh, well.

696
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,990
Right, next topic.

697
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,140
Daniel Applequist, because
I'm much nicer than Christian

698
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,930
Heilmann, I'm going to
give you your question.

699
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,882
[INAUDIBLE]

700
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:45,214
[LAUGHTER]

701
00:31:45,214 --> 00:31:47,700
DANIEL APPLEQUIST: OK.

702
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,451
Here we go.

703
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:49,617
Oh, this isn't what I wrote.

704
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:50,117
No.

705
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,360
[LAUGHTER]

706
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,420
So, in its march towards
increasing sophistication &mdash;

707
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,690
and I think this
question, parenthetically,

708
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:01,030
this question kind of goes
back to the more display

709
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,170
browser-oriented web that
we've been talking about

710
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,840
for &mdash; it's not to
discount the importance

711
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,970
of the data-oriented web, which
I think is also important.

712
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,430
But in its march towards
increasing sophistication,

713
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,580
is the web losing touch
with big easy to learn,

714
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,111
and therefore accessible
to a very broad authorship

715
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:20,610
community?

716
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,330
And I'm going to add one
more parenthetical statement.

717
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,570
I think this relates to
the whole meme that's

718
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,680
going on right now about
teaching kids to code

719
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,070
and getting kids, and
especially young people, engaged

720
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,750
in development.

721
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:41,441
How do we get them
engaged in the web easily?

722
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:42,940
MALE SPEAKER: OK,
thank you, Daniel.

723
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,640
I'm going re-paraphrase
your question

724
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,655
back to &mdash; another
fork of the question,

725
00:32:46,655 --> 00:32:49,240
if you like &mdash; which is,
it used to be terribly

726
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,930
easy to write a basic web page.

727
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,800
It was pretty shit, but
it was very easy to do.

728
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,680
That was an Onramp.

729
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,110
That point has been
made earlier today.

730
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,630
But in order to be competitive,
or to provide a better user

731
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,030
experience, things have
got a lot more complicated.

732
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,220
Have they got disproportionately
complicated in order

733
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,794
to achieve the
objectives of being

734
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:12,460
more sophisticated
than they used to be?

735
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:12,670
JENI TENNISON: No.

736
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,260
SCOTT JENSON: No.

737
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,721
TOM ASHWORTH: Yeah.

738
00:33:13,721 --> 00:33:14,429
MALE SPEAKER: No.

739
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:16,951
[LAUGHTER]

740
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:17,450
Right.

741
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,750
ALICE: Like basically,
here's the thing.

742
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,480
MALE SPEAKER: We
can deal with this.

743
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,460
No, no, no, no no.

744
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:20,960
Right.

745
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,970
ALICE: You can &mdash;
back in the day,

746
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,720
it was still quite hard to
get a web page onto a server,

747
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,440
and not a lot of people
are interested in doing it

748
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,880
proportionately, because it
was quite a lot of effort.

749
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,860
Because there wasn't this
sort of corpus of help

750
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,260
and tutorials and stuff.

751
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,550
And now, you can get very, very,
far, and do very cool stuff,

752
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,840
without knowing
basically anything.

753
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,060
And that may be a good
thing or a bad thing.

754
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,990
But to say that we've made
it too complicated for people

755
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,560
is really doing people
a massive disservice.

756
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,010
These people that
are like, oh, I

757
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,032
can't be bothered &mdash;
they've always existed.

758
00:33:58,032 --> 00:34:00,490
And they're still around, and
they still can't be bothered.

759
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,406
And then there are people
who can be bothered,

760
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:06,420
and they also are still
being served by what we have.

761
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,659
And you can just go further,
and the people who will say, oh,

762
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,550
but it's possible for people
to make terrible mistakes

763
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,636
and do really dangerous
things &mdash; that's fine!

764
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,219
Those people are
going to learn really

765
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:19,320
quickly how to be better,
and that's brilliant, too.

766
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,767
So this kind of &mdash; yeah,
I hate this question.

767
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:25,100
MALE SPEAKER: They'll learn
really quickly, but possibly

768
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,630
with disastrous consequences.

769
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,359
ALICE: Well &mdash;

770
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,400
MALE SPEAKER: You know,
I use this analogy, which

771
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,608
is putting a chainsaw in
the hands of a six-year-old.

772
00:34:31,608 --> 00:34:34,560
Either they learn, or
well, you know, they don't.

773
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,750
TOM ASHWORTH: I teach people
every week, mostly beginners.

774
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,510
In fact, people who live in
London &mdash; Codebar.io, minority

775
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,020
people in tech, we're trying
to promote, particularly women.

776
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,728
So if you've got free
time on Wednesdays,

777
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:47,719
please come to that.

778
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,620
But I teach people
every Wednesday,

779
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,872
and I see this a lot.

780
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:53,205
I see people who are coming
new to HTML, and new to CSS.

781
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:56,350
And absolutely it is possible
for them to go from zero,

782
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:59,290
and in an hour and a half, have
a huge smile on their face,

783
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,700
because they've just
created their first website.

784
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,050
There's absolutely
no reason to believe

785
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,049
that that's fading away.

786
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:05,780
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and also,
when you started programming

787
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,326
and doing things &mdash;
initially, [INAUDIBLE]

788
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:16,290
And then when you want to do
anything dynamic, [INAUDIBLE]

789
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,839
Are you sure that
we can do anything

790
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:18,880
more dangerous than that?

791
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,925
MALE SPEAKER: I think
we're talking, OK &mdash;

792
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:20,530
ALICE: Yeah.

793
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,660
MALE SPEAKER: OK, valid.

794
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,540
Andrew.

795
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,520
ANDREW SPOONER: I think,
as any technology matures,

796
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,180
we realize some of
the things that we

797
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,360
used to do that were
quite difficult to do,

798
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,910
we try and simplify those.

799
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,340
If I think back when I
started the web, just trying

800
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:39,374
to get someone to &mdash; just
trying to get data into a form

801
00:35:39,374 --> 00:35:41,290
and save that onto a
server somewhere &mdash; that's

802
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,810
actually quite a
complicated task.

803
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,510
It took us a long
time to do that.

804
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,190
It was a very
expensive thing to do.

805
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,820
There's a lot of
simple tools out there

806
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,190
that allow people to
do that quite easy now.

807
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,172
And that's an easy
thing to do, and I

808
00:35:53,172 --> 00:35:55,380
think it means that some
people don't understand what

809
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,250
it is that they're actually &mdash;
what's actually going on

810
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,000
in the background.

811
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,683
But then, do you
need to know what's

812
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:01,110
going on in the background?

813
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:01,943
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

814
00:36:01,943 --> 00:36:05,310

815
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,630
AUDIENCE: Hi.

816
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,375
I just want to add
to that a little bit,

817
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,455
and say I just recently
started doing Code Club.

818
00:36:11,455 --> 00:36:12,799
So I teach kids as young as &mdash;

819
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:14,340
MALE SPEAKER: How
are you getting on?

820
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,222
No, sorry.

821
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:16,986
[LAUGHTER]

822
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:19,740
AUDIENCE: One day, I hope
to make a career out of it.

823
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,135
But I teach kids as young as
five or six how to programming.

824
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:25,160
And the speed, the
facility, with which

825
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,830
they pick up quite sophisticated
concepts is incredible.

826
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,820
And I think with the low barrier
to entry that the web provides,

827
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,385
I don't think
we're in any danger

828
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:35,252
of making that too
complex at all.

829
00:36:35,252 --> 00:36:35,960
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

830
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,880
ALICE: I think Linda has
just arrived from Code Club

831
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,380
as we were speaking
about it, so &mdash;

832
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,684
LINDA: Hi, everyone.

833
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:44,995
ALICE: So without wishing
to put words in her mouth

834
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,620
about what the mission
of Code Club is,

835
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,580
I mean it really fills a gap
in education that does exist.

836
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,010
And there is a
problem with that.

837
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,710
And so when you're
talking about &mdash; maybe

838
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,970
you're talking about
coming to the web

839
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,367
as a teenager who is looking
to make their first web page.

840
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:02,700
And then there's Code Club,
who is sort of enabling kids

841
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,240
at a much younger age to get
involved with technology,

842
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,420
and think about
programming in a way

843
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,700
that the education
system in this country &mdash;

844
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,270
TOM ASHWORTH: And
since we're talking

845
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,040
about the future
of the web, really,

846
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,010
groups like Code Club
and Young Rewired State

847
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,100
are making the future
of the web, which

848
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,880
is the people who make the web.

849
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,089
So we should invest in those.

850
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:21,255
MALE SPEAKER: OK, thank you.

851
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:23,060
We do need to push
on here, because I

852
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,150
think we probably only have
got time for two more things,

853
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,060
if we're going to
stick to our timing.

854
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,870
So Daniel, no danger there.

855
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,030
OK?

856
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,870
Moving on.

857
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,570

00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:49,019
[INAUDIBLE]

863
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:51,360
MALE SPEAKER: Yes, this
was a combination of yours

864
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,730
and someone else's.

865
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:56,996
So just to check, it
starts, "Is the web--?"

866
00:37:56,996 --> 00:38:00,197
[LAUGHTER]

867
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,030
AUDIENCE: So, I've &mdash;

868
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,840
MALE SPEAKER: No.

869
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,250
[LAUGHTER]

870
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,890
AUDIENCE: I've been given this
to ask on behalf of Ed "So-den"

871
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:09,470
or "Sow-den," could be, but I
think it's the question that

872
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,980
Remy, perhaps, wanted to ask &mdash;

873
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,530
MALE SPEAKER: That is exactly.

874
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,960
AUDIENCE: It's kind
of been bubbling

875
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,668
under a few of the
conversations as well.

876
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:15,900
It goes like this.

877
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,235
Is the web going
to grow into into

878
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:23,180
an all-encompassing platform
for all future computing?

879
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,980
Is there any area
which will be spared?

880
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,010
Or, by contrast, is the future
of the web just providing

881
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,770
APIs for native
applications to be built?

882
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,770
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

883
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,760
So, this is a question about,
what are the limits of the web?

884
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,510
What is the definition
of the word, "web?"

885
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,680
I don't think we probably
want to go that way,

886
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,700
but you guys started having
a little bit of a hammer

887
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,020
and tongs about that earlier.

888
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,470
Would you like to continue
that in the context

889
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,570
of this question?

890
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:54,780
So, will the web grow into an
all-encompassing computation

891
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,280
platform?

892
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,780
Jeni, you say no, because some
things are inherently web-like,

893
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,150
like HTTP, are not suitable.

894
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,460
JENI TENNISON: Yeah, so I
think that the basic &mdash; how

895
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,990
I would define the web, which
would be about the use of HTTP

896
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:14,190
and the use of resources
identified by URLs,

897
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,110
takes us a long
way, but there are

898
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:22,260
some aspects of &mdash;
particularly data

899
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,540
flows on the internet &mdash; that
don't use web protocols,

900
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,960
and should not
use web protocols.

901
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,000
And we need to be thinking
outside of the HTTP

902
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,830
as the only protocol that
we ever use on the internet.

903
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,529
MALE SPEAKER: Andrew.

904
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:40,570
ANDREW SPOONER: So, is
this also about languages,

905
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,507
and how we can extend
languages to other &mdash;

906
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:43,965
MALE SPEAKER: You
can make it that.

907
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,048
ANDREW SPOONER: Platforms.

908
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:47,270
Thank you.

909
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,200
I see the web.

910
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,220
We've invested so
much time in it.

911
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,178
We've invested so much
time putting the content

912
00:39:51,178 --> 00:39:53,020
into a format that
we can access.

913
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,030
And we can do so much more
with languages like JavaScript

914
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,010
nowadays.

915
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,385
They're actually starting to
stand up to other languages.

916
00:39:59,385 --> 00:40:01,357
So the web can exist
in almost anything.

917
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,440
If I think about some of
the development work I do

918
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,370
the moment using JavaScript to
access the same APIs that I can

919
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,830
do through C++ &mdash; or I
could do through C#,

920
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,710
when creating applications
for Windows 8, for instance &mdash;

921
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,210
I'm using the same
web technologies,

922
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,130
the same web languages &mdash;

923
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,296
MALE SPEAKER: So are you
saying that the distinction

924
00:40:19,296 --> 00:40:21,380
is a bogus distinction
in some ways?

925
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,530
You're saying everything
flows into everything else.

926
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,422
ANDREW SPOONER: I
think it can exist &mdash;

927
00:40:28,422 --> 00:40:29,130
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

928
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,330
ANDREW SPOONER: In places where
we don't have it currently,

929
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:31,990
yes.

930
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,660
MALE SPEAKER: Remy,
I'm hoping this

931
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,550
was adjacent to the
point you were making.

932
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,280
REMY: No.

933
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,285
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely
nothing to do with it.

934
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:39,580
REMY: It's not so much
nothing to do with it.

935
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,765
I just don't think the
web will be everything,

936
00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:44,740
and I don't think it will
just be the ayes [INAUDIBLE].

937
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,060
ALICE: So, I agree with
what you're saying.

938
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,587
I think there's a lot of hype
around the Internet of Things.

939
00:40:51,587 --> 00:40:53,670
There's a lot of hype
around smart watches and all

940
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:53,990
that stuff.

941
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,040
And I think there are
a lot of companies

942
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,000
that are doing a
lot of figuring out

943
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,670
through doing, at the moment.

944
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,300
And what we'll find in 10
years &mdash; well no, not 10 years,

945
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,200
five years &mdash; is the web
will be in some stuff,

946
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,559
and it'll make a lot of sense.

947
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,100
And everybody will
be like, check out

948
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,260
my cool web-enabled thing.

949
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,760
And then it won't
be in other stuff.

950
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,780
And people will
be like, remember

951
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,071
when we tried to put the
internet into fucking fridges?

952
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:16,846
That was madness.

953
00:41:16,846 --> 00:41:19,720
[LAUGHTER]

954
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,100
But there is a lot of hype
and a lot of marketing stuff

955
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,900
that makes all of this seem like
people are seriously thinking

956
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,760
about this, when actually
they're just figuring stuff

957
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,259
out.

958
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:30,590
And some of it is bad,
and some of it is &mdash;

959
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,085
MALE SPEAKER: I
seriously challenge

960
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:33,460
that, in the sense
that &mdash; go back

961
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,730
to the audience in a
second &mdash; in the sense

962
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:39,055
that I'm old enough to
have said 15 years ago,

963
00:41:39,055 --> 00:41:40,430
do you know what
people are going

964
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,305
to be using these
devices here to do?

965
00:41:42,305 --> 00:41:44,160
All kinds of cool
stuff on the move.

966
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,970
And people said,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

967
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,190
We'll wait to see that.

968
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,256
So I think that expressing
skepticism about the direction

969
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:51,630
that these
technologies are going

970
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,130
is a potentially
dangerous route to take.

971
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,650
ALICE: Oh, well let's not
have any skepticism then.

972
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,780
[LAUGHTER]

973
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,294
MALE SPEAKER: That
wasn't my point.

974
00:42:02,294 --> 00:42:04,460
TOM ASHWORTH: I write
JavaScript all day, every day.

975
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,540
And quite frankly, I do not
want JavaScript on a pacemaker.

976
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,640
I do not want &mdash;

977
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,640
[LAUGHTER]

978
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,292
I just &mdash; if you
said to me, look,

979
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:15,500
here's a web-enabled thing
that's going in your body,

980
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,905
I would tell you
to fuck right off.

981
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:19,829
[LAUGHTER]

982
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,865
MALE SPEAKER: Go ahead.

983
00:42:22,865 --> 00:42:24,740
AUDIENCE: We actually
have &mdash; there's actually

984
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,780
examples of what we
tried to do once,

985
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,650
when there was no
[INAUDIBLE] 40 thing.

986
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,160
We tried to do an interpreter
for doing things running

987
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,130
on a device that,
basically, you couldn't even

988
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,800
fit a JavaScript interpreter on.

989
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,690
Because I don't know if you
remember about JavaScript &mdash;

990
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,850
apart from having obvious
limitations regarding how

991
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:43,360
we handle numbers, et cetera &mdash;
requires quite a bit of stack,

992
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,890
et cetera.

993
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,000
And we ended up doing
the first [INAUDIBLE]

994
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,237
thing that we built in
this company in a scheme.

995
00:42:49,237 --> 00:42:51,570
In a scheme, because it was
the smaller interpreter than

996
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,750
could fit in like
a proximity 4k.

997
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,250
Right?

998
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,290
So there would be things,
as we were saying,

999
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:00,070
that basically you cannot
use the HTML CSS for actually

1000
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,610
making your interface simpler.

1001
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,744
And you've got to use
JavaScript to kind of reduce

1002
00:43:03,744 --> 00:43:05,910
what you have been doing,
because literally, there's

1003
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:06,609
no space.

1004
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:08,775
So not only because of the
whole asynchronous thing,

1005
00:43:08,775 --> 00:43:10,842
but because technically,
some of these things

1006
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:12,300
and [INAUDIBLE]
things are not even

1007
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,472
going to have stack
to run JavaScript on.

1008
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:15,180
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

1009
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,854
Nor to use HTTP,
for that matter.

1010
00:43:16,854 --> 00:43:19,520
MALE SPEAKER: Chris, and you had
a word you wanted to interject,

1011
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,561
and then we're probably
going to have to move on.

1012
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:22,385
CHRIS: Yeah.

1013
00:43:22,385 --> 00:43:23,275
A few.

1014
00:43:23,275 --> 00:43:25,020
Actually, one thing
is &mdash; what amazes

1015
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,820
me is we talk about
HTTP, but then we're

1016
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,960
actually using a system
here that uses web sockets.

1017
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,500
And we're using a system
that uses WebRTC and has

1018
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,940
PO2P connections and
could even be encrypted

1019
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,173
between two computers, so
that companies starting with N

1020
00:43:37,173 --> 00:43:40,870
and ending with SA couldn't
actually listen to us.

1021
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,810
I find it also
interesting that we &mdash;

1022
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,050
when I started on the web,
what I loved most about it

1023
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,649
is that I can use whatever
I want to actually start

1024
00:43:47,649 --> 00:43:48,440
connecting with it.

1025
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,440
And now we're talking about
smart watches, glasses

1026
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,860
that cost $1,500, basically
toys for the Western world

1027
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,790
to be the future of the web.

1028
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,130
And to me, the future
of the web lies in,

1029
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,540
as you said, emerging markets
with more people than we have.

1030
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,800
And fixing that to gadgets that
are closed in one environment

1031
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,870
is, to me, the wrong way of
making the future of the web.

1032
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,540
MALE SPEAKER: OK, a closing
comment from the panel, here?

1033
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,540
Scott, have you got
something to say about this?

1034
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,580
SCOTT JENSON:
Well, I'm intrigued

1035
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,387
with how we want
this future to go.

1036
00:44:18,387 --> 00:44:19,970
Because there's
clearly the discussion

1037
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,510
of how the standards
bodies work.

1038
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:24,051
But I would argue that the vast
majority of the conversations

1039
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:26,280
that I tend to have with
people is all about &mdash; well,

1040
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,450
how can you make this web
page scroll on a small screen.

1041
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,570
And so, I think, to
a certain extent,

1042
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,470
we've trapped ourselves
in our own paradigm,

1043
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,760
which is that these are
just scrolling web pages.

1044
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,510
And I think that there's so
much more the web can do.

1045
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:41,310
For example, the previous
question about multi-displays.

1046
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,187
I don't want to aspire what
the iPhone was five years ago.

1047
00:44:45,187 --> 00:44:47,270
And I think the web can
do so much more than that.

1048
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,770
CHRIS: Isn't the
issue that we still

1049
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,491
say it should look
the same everywhere?

1050
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:52,490
That's what I always have
to fight [INAUDIBLE] &mdash;

1051
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,570
MALE SPEAKER: This is a
little off-topic, guys.

1052
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,310
SCOTT JENSON: I don't
agree with that, but yeah.

1053
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:55,620
Sorry.

1054
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,710
MALE SPEAKER: So, I'm sorry.

1055
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:57,959
But we're going to close that.

1056
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:58,870
It's my job.

1057
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,004
I quite enjoy it, actually.

1058
00:45:00,004 --> 00:45:03,140
[LAUGHTER]

1059
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:03,870
Right.

1060
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,520
We have a final
question, which is

1061
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,350
going to set us &mdash; I
think down the path,

1062
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,710
actually, that you were
on just now, Scott.

1063
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,990
So we'll let you
continue on that one.

1064
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,303
From Andre Barrons.

1065
00:45:14,303 --> 00:45:21,850

1066
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,880
AUDIENCE: Hi, this
is Andre's question.

1067
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,870
Web developers, and
even corporations,

1068
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,640
that are outside the
browser-vendor community

1069
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,950
have a feeling of being
a prisoner to decisions

1070
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,040
others make, with
often limited means

1071
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,930
to address certain problems.

1072
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:38,314
Who should be determining the
future of the web, and how?

1073
00:45:38,314 --> 00:45:40,200
MALE SPEAKER: So, who
should be determining

1074
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,135
the future of the web?

1075
00:45:41,135 --> 00:45:41,635
And how?

1076
00:45:41,635 --> 00:45:43,230
SCOTT JENSON: Well, I assume
this is the whole Extensible

1077
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,570
Web Manifesto discussion.

1078
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,570
MALE SPEAKER: It can be.

1079
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,120
SCOTT JENSON: It can be.

1080
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,950
I still feel that
our biggest issue

1081
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,279
is our own myopia of what
we think is important.

1082
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,070
Because the vast majority
of this community

1083
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:58,790
is just trying to figure and
argue about apps versus native.

1084
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,780
And so, to me, I would
like the web community

1085
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,360
to start to figure out
a way to experiment

1086
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,276
with these new things.

1087
00:46:03,276 --> 00:46:05,210
Like, how would
I write a web app

1088
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,640
to work across
multiple displays?

1089
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,506
I'd have to roll
everything from scratch.

1090
00:46:09,506 --> 00:46:10,880
And I just don't
think that we're

1091
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,830
talking about ways to encourage
that kind of experimentation.

1092
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,550
It seems to be so
standards-driven now

1093
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,740
that we've lost the
ability to do stupid shit.

1094
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,990
And I'd like to do more of it.

1095
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,600
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

1096
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,170
You carry on doing
more stupid shit.

1097
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,700
I'll talk to someone else.

1098
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,650
Jeni, the view expressed
here is that people

1099
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,980
don't have a sufficient
voice in the process.

1100
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,010

1101
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,730
JENI TENNISON: So I think
the web is what we build.

1102
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,475
It's what we make.

1103
00:46:40,475 --> 00:46:41,683
It's through experimentation.

1104
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:44,400

1105
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,840
And we have a responsibility &mdash;
if we want our voice

1106
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,090
to be heard, step up and shout.

1107
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,890

1108
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:59,030
So that in terms
of standardization,

1109
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:02,590
I think the W3C has done a lot
to try and open up discussion &mdash;

1110
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,330
through adding community
groups, for example,

1111
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:08,530
over the past three years.

1112
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:12,480
But I do think that
there is a massive gap

1113
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,070
between the [INAUDIBLE]
that are in this room here,

1114
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,660
and the majority of web
developers out there,

1115
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,230
who probably do
feel that they have

1116
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:23,020
no role in the conversation.

1117
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,280
MALE SPEAKER: So can I just
ask for little straw poll here?

1118
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,955
Out of everybody in this
room here, who has actually &mdash;

1119
00:47:29,955 --> 00:47:33,490
or who does &mdash;
participate particularly

1120
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:36,962
in the W3C process?

1121
00:47:36,962 --> 00:47:38,240
OK.

1122
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:38,740
So &mdash;

1123
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,234
SCOTT JENSON: [INAUDIBLE],
or specifically W3C?

1124
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,900
MALE SPEAKER:
Specifically W3C, I think,

1125
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,540
since we're talking
about the web.

1126
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:49,585
And I guess I'm making &mdash; the
web and W3C are kind of &mdash; well,

1127
00:47:49,585 --> 00:47:50,295
it needn't be.

1128
00:47:50,295 --> 00:47:53,450
So is the W3C the future
guardian of the web?

1129
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,350
Well, that's another
question, I guess.

1130
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:58,650
Someone could ask it.

1131
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,000
What I think is the view
this is expressed here

1132
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,274
is that that's not
working particularly well.

1133
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:08,440
ANDREW SPOONER: But I think
everybody in this room &mdash;

1134
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,430
everybody who contacts
a browser vendor

1135
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,467
and asks them to
fix a bug, asks them

1136
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:14,550
to add a feature &mdash; you've
all got a voice in this.

1137
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,487
They're all listening.

1138
00:48:15,487 --> 00:48:18,070
I know that there was &mdash; I can't
remember the exact numbers &mdash; x

1139
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:22,701
thousand of bugs reported to
the Internet Explorer team.

1140
00:48:22,701 --> 00:48:24,950
And there's a team of hundreds
of people sitting there

1141
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,910
listening to those,
implementing those changes.

1142
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,880
So if you're sending
your requests in,

1143
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,560
there's people listening to it.

1144
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,740
And ultimately, I think
everyone in this room

1145
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,660
has a chance to input
into where it goes.

1146
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:41,170
SCOTT JENSON: I would ask if
you've had experience of that.

1147
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:47,190
Because just get to
give some examples,

1148
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,220
there's a bug in Firefox
from about 2002, 2003,

1149
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,580
to do with fragment
identifiers in iframes.

1150
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,100
It was opened in 2003.

1151
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,134
I bumped it a year and half ago.

1152
00:48:58,134 --> 00:49:00,550
Somebody else had bumped it
about three years before that.

1153
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,230
No nothing from Mozilla.

1154
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,410
And in terms of
Internet Explorer,

1155
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,610
I don't know who to talk to.

1156
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,000
I don't know how I can
get at those people.

1157
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,040
Apple &mdash; we all know
the story there.

1158
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,060
And, for example, when the
developer tooling guys were up,

1159
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,130
both of the people
who represented people

1160
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,300
who are working on
these things &mdash; when

1161
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,674
asked, how do we
contribute, kind

1162
00:49:20,674 --> 00:49:23,010
of shrunk up and
wrung their hands.

1163
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,915
I just don't think
it's true that these

1164
00:49:24,915 --> 00:49:26,840
are friendly environments
that we can get to.

1165
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,423
ANDREW SPOONER:
Connect.Microsoft.com,

1166
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,127
where you can
submit your request,

1167
00:49:30,127 --> 00:49:32,585
and there's people &mdash; there's
paid Microsoft employees &mdash; who

1168
00:49:32,585 --> 00:49:33,900
will then respond to
you and say, right, yes,

1169
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,691
we know about this.

1170
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:36,270
Or say, this isn't
a feature we're

1171
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,580
interested in implementing.

1172
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,660
And you'll get a response from
a human being through that,

1173
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,760
and there's loads of people in
there who will respond to you.

1174
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,230
MALE SPEAKER: OK, let's
go to the audience.

1175
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,490
We've got someone at the back.

1176
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:46,560
We've got Guy, and
then &mdash; hang on a second.

1177
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,810
Let's go to the back first.

1178
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:52,640

1179
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,560
AUDIENCE: Hi.

1180
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,600
I'm kind of biased
on this, but I

1181
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,030
think that out of the four
rendering engines that we

1182
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:05,310
saw at the beginning, three
of them are open source.

1183
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:11,150
So basically, people can either
work on the engines themselves

1184
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:14,280
or find someone who
will do this for him.

1185
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,350
And the reason I'm biased,
because I'm currently working &mdash;

1186
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,280
I started a crowd
funding effort yesterday

1187
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:28,220
to add feature &mdash; the
picture element to Blink.

1188
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,170
And I think that the future
should have more of that.

1189
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,306
More people adding features
to the open source rendering

1190
00:50:36,306 --> 00:50:36,805
thing.

1191
00:50:36,805 --> 00:50:38,910
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

1192
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,150
Coming forward in the room, Guy.

1193
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:45,690
ALICE: I think that's a pretty
high barrier to entry, though,

1194
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:48,310
isn't it, for most
web developers?

1195
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,734
MALE SPEAKER: Yes, that is a &mdash;

1196
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:51,400
ALICE: That, as a
suggestion, it seems &mdash;

1197
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,259
TOM ASHWORTH: Well the
Extensible Web Manifesto

1198
00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:56,050
has been mentioned.

1199
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,790
If we work towards
that ideal, where

1200
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,116
we expose more of the kind
of primitives that are there

1201
00:51:01,116 --> 00:51:03,532
in the browsers but we currently
have no access to &mdash; if we

1202
00:51:03,532 --> 00:51:05,470
expose them to
developers, then I

1203
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:08,700
think we stand a chance of
being able to at least iterate

1204
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,960
more quickly towards an API
that we can then standardize.

1205
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,490
ALICE: I think, given the
choice between downloading

1206
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:21,770
and patching Chrome myself or
just working around a problem,

1207
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:25,160
I would work around it &mdash;
like, pragmatically.

1208
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,810
[INAUDIBLE]

1209
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:28,482
[LIGHT LAUGHTER]

1210
00:51:28,482 --> 00:51:30,440
AUDIENCE: It's a little
different &mdash; in general,

1211
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,810
the notion of [INAUDIBLE]
as the web evolved,

1212
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,950
and I think we're losing
sight of the server side.

1213
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:37,350
Like we keep talking about the
clients and those components,

1214
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:38,725
but I think the
future of the web

1215
00:51:38,725 --> 00:51:41,720
lies a lot with the
services consumed on it.

1216
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,410
And I think, clearly, all these
things and all these devices

1217
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:45,780
are a part of the technology.

1218
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,040
But what you can do on
the web &mdash; especially

1219
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,150
in the developing world,
or in access to banking,

1220
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,220
or facilities, or
payments by the phone,

1221
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:59,155
or ordering your groceries,
or calling a cab &mdash; all

1222
00:51:59,155 --> 00:52:01,180
of those components, I
think, are a big part

1223
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,280
of the future of the web.

1224
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,170
So the fact that it
might still be HTML &mdash;

1225
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,380
or maybe we're not evolving
it &mdash; is sometimes less critical

1226
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,640
versus the creativity
or the disruptions that

1227
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,430
happen on the business side of
it, on the server side of it.

1228
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,050
MALE SPEAKER: OK, can we drop
on row forwards, I think?

1229
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,570
OK, two rows.

1230
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,450
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

1231
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,639
In terms of having
an input, which

1232
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:26,430
is what Andrew was
talking to about getting

1233
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:29,870
in touch with people, I
found an inconsistency SVG.

1234
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,264
I wrote a blog post about it.

1235
00:52:31,264 --> 00:52:32,680
I managed to get
in touch with one

1236
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,100
of the editors of the SVG spec.

1237
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,058
I showed him the thing.

1238
00:52:35,058 --> 00:52:37,490
He's updating SVG spec
to fix that thing.

1239
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,891
It does happen, it does
work, it is out there,

1240
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:42,000
and you can get involved in it.

1241
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,320
MALE SPEAKER: OK Go
right to the back,

1242
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,421
and then we'll
start to close down.

1243
00:52:50,421 --> 00:52:52,170
AUDIENCE: So we can
have examples of times

1244
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,120
when community input has worked.

1245
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,730
What we need is an example
of when it hasn't, right?

1246
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,850
When the will of the
community has not

1247
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,410
been exerted over
browser vendors.

1248
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,850
So maybe an example
of that might be DRM.

1249
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,790
An example might be DRM,
where it's going in browsers.

1250
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:11,365
And generally speaking,
that's not what people want.

1251
00:53:11,365 --> 00:53:12,890
MALE SPEAKER: OK, fine.

1252
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,690
I want to ask Natasha, who's
sitting right in the front

1253
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:19,157
here, and put her on the spot.

1254
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:21,490
Because I know that she has
something interesting to say

1255
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:25,895
about when people are invited
to take part, they don't.

1256
00:53:25,895 --> 00:53:28,270
NATASHA: What, so
W3C in specific?

1257
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:32,430
Well, I've been very fortunate
with contributing to W3C.

1258
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:36,702
I co-chair a group,
and I'm actually

1259
00:53:36,702 --> 00:53:38,910
filling Joe's shoes right
now, which is pretty tough,

1260
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,480
but I'm giving it all I've got.

1261
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,240
MALE SPEAKER: And not
very pleasant, either.

1262
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,355
NATASHA: But we need
people to help out.

1263
00:53:43,355 --> 00:53:45,480
And we're so grateful that
people want to help out.

1264
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,310
And we know there's a
membership issue there,

1265
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:51,100
but if you want to help out
on what we're doing in the web

1266
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,640
group, then please
come speak to us.

1267
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:58,110
There's lots of W3C guys are
moving to using open tools,

1268
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,617
like GitHub and Twitter.

1269
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:02,700
We have a Twitter account.

1270
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,640
And of course, the
W3C is open anyway.

1271
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,920
So if you want to
contribute, you can.

1272
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,600
And please come and speak to me
about that later at the party.

1273
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,632
I'd be very happy to
speak to you about that.

1274
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:13,456
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks, Natasha.

1275
00:54:13,456 --> 00:54:14,950
OK, so the answer to
the question &mdash; Tom,

1276
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,616
do you have something
to say about that?

1277
00:54:16,616 --> 00:54:19,310
TOM ASHWORTH: Yeah, the
mention of DRM is interesting.

1278
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:20,960
It's not an area I
know anything about,

1279
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,876
so I'm not going to speak
specifically to DRM.

1280
00:54:22,876 --> 00:54:28,700
But the idea of people who have
a vested interest in that kind

1281
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,949
of technology encroaching on,
say, issues of net neutrality,

1282
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:34,115
is something that I think
is really important for us

1283
00:54:34,115 --> 00:54:34,620
to talk about.

1284
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,828
I mean, if we're talking
about the future of the web,

1285
00:54:36,828 --> 00:54:39,120
we're talking about
a situation where

1286
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,965
I have to pay my ISP
for a group of websites

1287
00:54:43,965 --> 00:54:45,120
that I'm allowed to visit.

1288
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,670
And I have to extend that
package for just $5.99 a month

1289
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,570
to get access to this
other search engine,

1290
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,300
or this website that wasn't
on their original list.

1291
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,240
And they couldn't &mdash; there was
some kind of hostility between

1292
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,785
the two parties or whatever.

1293
00:55:01,785 --> 00:55:03,410
MALE SPEAKER: There's
a bigger question

1294
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:05,697
that we had to skip exactly
on this topic, I'm afraid.

1295
00:55:05,697 --> 00:55:07,530
TOM ASHWORTH: But there's
a bigger community

1296
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:08,570
that needs to be
involved in that.

1297
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,060
The web community
is a small part

1298
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,820
of the group of people
who are involved

1299
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:16,510
in ensuring we keep or maintain
the kind of net neutrality

1300
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:17,984
that we wish to have.

1301
00:55:17,984 --> 00:55:19,400
And it's not my
area of expertise,

1302
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,810
but I sometimes feel like
we sort of close ourselves

1303
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:25,230
in and say, well let's keep
the web bit of this good &mdash;

1304
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,210
the HTML CSS
JavaScript, that stack.

1305
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,259
Let's keep this good.

1306
00:55:28,259 --> 00:55:30,550
As long as we look after
this, everything else be fine.

1307
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,210
Sometimes, I wish we
could take a step back,

1308
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,260
and say, you know what?

1309
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,440
Maybe we could stop worrying
about that for a bit.

1310
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,590
And say, let's get the people
who work on the networking

1311
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:41,640
hardware, and who do
all these other aspects,

1312
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,030
and bring us all
together to make

1313
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:47,130
sure we can, going forward,
keep the web and the internet

1314
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,490
in the way we'd like it to be.

1315
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:49,880
MALE SPEAKER: OK, thank you.

1316
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,500
Now, this is unscripted.

1317
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,670
Alice and down the
line, in three words,

1318
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:59,048
then, to close us out today &mdash;
what is the future of the web?

1319
00:55:59,048 --> 00:56:00,044
ALICE: I don't know.

1320
00:56:00,044 --> 00:56:03,530
[LAUGHTER AND CHEERING]

1321
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:07,514

1322
00:56:07,514 --> 00:56:10,004
MALE SPEAKER: Tom.

1323
00:56:10,004 --> 00:56:11,740
[INAUDIBLE] that response.

1324
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,510
That was brilliant.

1325
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:22,780
TOM ASHWORTH: Kids,
freedom, help?

1326
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,650
I dunno.

1327
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,960
MALE SPEAKER: Scott.

1328
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,390
SCOTT JENSON: Lots of arguing.

1329
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:27,332
[LAUGHTER]

1330
00:56:27,332 --> 00:56:28,790

Andrew, I get to give

1331
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:29,957
the privilege of being last.

1332
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:31,748
ANDREW SPOONER: Oh,
I'd just say connected.

1333
00:56:31,748 --> 00:56:33,340
MALE SPEAKER:
Connected, connected.

1334
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,290
OK, Jeni?

1335
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:38,170
JENI TENNISON:
Redecentralization,

1336
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,620
just because I like that word.

1337
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,330
And data.

1338
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,540
That's only two.

1339
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,330
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

1340
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,420
Thank you very
much to our panel.
