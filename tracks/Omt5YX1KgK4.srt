1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,550

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,660
Welcome back to Google
Developers Weekly for

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,930
September 23, 2013.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,110
I'm Louis Gray, and this is our
highlight reel of what's

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,820
happening in the world
of Google Developers

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,560
on the set and off.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,190
Strap in, buckle up.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,400
We've got a lot to talk about.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,920
First, beautiful code and
intelligent applications often

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,560
lead to happy users, but if an
application or a website

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,490
confuses a user, it introduces
friction and it can stop your

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,670
startup cold.

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,370
Nazmul Idris, a champion for
user experience, stopped by

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,000
Root Access with host Don
Dodge to teach us how to

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,880
reduce friction and boost
user acquisition.

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,880
As you can imagine, here at Team
GDL, we believe strongly

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,970
in the power of YouTube
subscriptions.

18
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,920
From New York, Ibrahim Ulukaya
and Kurt Wilms walked us

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,290
through how to code and
customize the recently

20
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,840
launched Subscribe button,
bringing your videos to those

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,440
users who don't want to miss a
single minute of your content.

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,980
We then saw the Google Analytics
duo of Andrew Wales

23
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,440
and Neil Rhodes introduce us
to Google Tag Manager for

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,900
Android and iOS, making it
easier to update website data

25
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,780
and mobile apps to measure
traffic and user behavior to

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,090
make your products
even better.

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,740
And in a new feature here on
GDL, we invited the Google

28
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,930
Enterprise Maps Team for
the first episode

29
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,750
of What in the World?

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,640
Dylan and Ryan Thomas, who I
assume are not related, showed

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,490
us how to access Google Maps
Engine layers using Maps API

32
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,640
JavaScript.

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,530
Keep in mind, this replaces the
map data layer for those

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,880
of you who are geocoders.

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,630
Looking at my map, it turns out
our next GDL came from the

36
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,970
southern hemisphere from Buenos
Aires, where Nick

37
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,490
[INAUDIBLE]

38
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,410
returned with the latest from
Latin America, talking Chrome

39
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,950
browser extensions.

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,390
[SPANISH].

41
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,150
And before the week wrapped, Don
Dodge was back for round

42
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,760
two of Root Access in our
studio, explaining the many

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,470
variables behind startup stock
ownership and what founders,

44
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,870
investors, and employees should
expect when they open

45
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,200
the envelopes containing
their options packages.

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,320
This is something you have
to get right to keep your

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,220
employee morale high.

48
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,850
In addition to all these great
shows, we were invited to live

49
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,800
stream from SFHTML5, the world's
largest HTML5 user

50
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,010
group, featuring many faces that
you recognize from GDL

51
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,270
including Colt McAnlis,
Paul Lewis, Paul

52
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,900
Irish, and Jake Archibald.

53
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,780
The two plus hour event featured
four fantastic talks

54
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,440
covering web performance, and
we've got it all saved for you

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,620
here on YouTube.

56
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,320
So cancel your plans tonight.

57
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,560
You've got homework.

58
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,510
And from Italy, Claudio
d'Angelis

59
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,940
talked to us about Dart.

60
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,570
Claudio discussed how to take
advantage of Dart when using

61
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,600
model-driven views and web
components to build your apps.

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,370
Very nice.

63
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,730
So as you can see, we've been
hard at work sharing the

64
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,440
latest from all around
Google this week.

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,190
The same is true for our
friends at Android, who

66
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,080
dropped five brand new Dev Bytes
episodes for you mobile

67
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,410
developers, and the latest in
the Game On series featuring

68
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,290
Google Games chats' own
Todd Kerpelman.

69
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,750
So find all of those and more
at the Android Developers

70
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,851
YouTube channel and at
developers.googl

71
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:54,540
e.com/live/android.

72
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,510
Outside the studio, you saw the
demo at Google I/O, and

73
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,780
now you can read the docs and
implement it yourself.

74
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,050
The Instant Buy API for Android
makes it incredibly

75
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,750
easy for your customers to buy
an item and check out as

76
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,080
easily as if they were using
the Google Play store.

77
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,210
No manual entry of billing
or shipping info

78
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,320
means happier customers.

79
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,100
The Chrome team has added to its
collection of dashboards

80
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,990
with new CSS Metrics chart.

81
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,720
Using anonymous opt-in stats
from Chrome, the new dashboard

82
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,280
shows how many pages were
visited by users using each of

83
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,890
435 CSS properties.

84
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,990
You can see which properties
have been used or look at a

85
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,150
usage timeline of one
particular property.

86
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,100
Take a look and watch for more
dashing dashboards for Chrome

87
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,080
usage coming in the future.

88
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,550
Heading back into the cloud,
this week BigQuery added nifty

89
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,800
new features.

90
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,230
You can now analyze data in
real time by using the

91
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,620
tabledata.InsertAll call, very
useful when you need to know

92
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,050
what's going on right away.

93
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,560
BigQuery also added table
decorators, which are not

94
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,720
pretty centerpieces but a syntax
for enabling you to

95
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,180
query only a subset of the
newest data instead of the

96
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,310
full table.

97
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,600
And finally, we added a bunch
of new functions and new web

98
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,780
UI features.

99
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,360
Also, a big change for AdSense
developers this week.

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,480
AdSense now provides add code
that works with HTTPS.

101
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,460
This is more important than
ever now that browsers are

102
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,810
getting more aggressive about
warning or even blocking pages

103
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,650
with mixed secure and
standard content.

104
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,700
By using the new code in
either synchronous or

105
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,210
asynchronous flavors, you can
ensure that your pages won't

106
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,740
suffer this indignity.

107
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,579
And to make sure you don't
suffer the indignity of

108
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,209
missing a single thing from
the world of Google

109
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,880
Developers, subscribe to Google
Developers on YouTube

110
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,980
and check out the GDL schedule
at developers.google.com/live.

111
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,330
I'm Louis Gray, and I'll see
you back in the studio.

112
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:35,110
