00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,390
MITCHELL FOLEY: Hello.

3
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,530

4
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,940
My name is Mitchell Foley.

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,600
I am a software engineer on the
Google Visualization API.

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,360

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,750
All right.

8
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,500
So, how many people are actually
familiar with the

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,730
Google Visualization API?

10
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,190
All right.

11
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,300
Actually a pretty good number.

12
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,150
That's much more than
I expected.

13
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,140
For those of you who haven't
heard of it before, well, I'll

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,030
give you a good introduction
to what it is and why you

15
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,530
might want to use
it right now.

16
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,530
So, what you can do with it,
it's actually a JavaScript API

17
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,700
that is available for free
for the public to use.

18
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,410
It's not only used by customers
outside of Google.

19
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,890
You might want to use it on
your personal website.

20
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,840
But it's used by internal
clients as well.

21
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,420
Like Google Docs, AdWords,
AdSense, YouTube Analytics; we

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,670
get a lot of customers
inside Google.

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,460
And what we want to do is we
want to take your data, and we

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,830
want to transform it into a
beautiful visualization that

25
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,810
you can use to tell
your story.

26
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,300
To convey a message
to your users.

27
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,350
And you can do that a couple
of different ways.

28
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,200
So we'll show you first,
one of our biggest

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,700
clients, Google Docs.

30
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,140
And what we have here is just
a spreadsheet with a little

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,540
bit of data.

32
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,820
How much pizza I had last
night for dinner.

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,480
Probably had a little
too much.

34
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,480
But we just took our-- the
type of pizza, and

35
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,890
the number of slices.

36
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,700
Put them in a couple of cells,
highlighted it, and then made

37
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,400
a chart out of it.

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,450
Very, very simple stuff.

39
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,610
But we can also do this just
on a regular HTML page.

40
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,680
So here's just a very,
very basic HTML page.

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,140
What we're doing here
is we're including

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,810
a very simple script.

43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,640
This is the Google's
JS API loader.

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,160
You can use it to load a number
of different libraries,

45
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,540
the visualization library
being one of them.

46
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,680
And we also have a placeholder
div here for our chart.

47
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,100
We're going to write a script
that you'll see in the next

48
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,940
page where we actually insert
the chart into this div.

49
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,460

50
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,410
OK.

51
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,040
So it looks like a big slide
full of code here, but it's

52
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,640
actually not too complicated.

53
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,710
We're not doing anything really
complicated here.

54
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,660
The first thing we're doing is
with that loader script that

55
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,860
we saw on the previous slide,
we're actually going to tell

56
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,860
it what we want to load.

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,030
And we want to load, in this
case, the core chart package.

58
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,400
We have a number of different
packages.

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,560
In this case, we just want that
simple bar chart that you

60
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,640
saw earlier.

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,385
So that's one of our
core charts.

62
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:29,370
And we're going to say, OK,
please load this core chart

63
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,160
package for us.

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,130
And when you're finished
loading, call this function.

65
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,260
This is just JavaScript.

66
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,980
It just runs right
in the browser.

67
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,160
And so it calls our callback
drawStuff.

68
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,330
Now once we know that we have
all of the classes, and

69
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,800
objects, and everything that we
need to draw the chart, we

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,970
can start to do that.

71
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,200
So the first thing we need
to do here is we need

72
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,220
to set up our data.

73
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,690
So we need to get our data
into a data table.

74
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,080
And the data table is the basic
construct that we use to

75
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,430
pass our data around, to format
it, to write extra

76
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,260
information about
it if necessary.

77
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,170
In this case, we're just doing a
very simple data table where

78
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,690
we're saying the topping and
the number of slices.

79
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,610
So we add our two columns, we
add our slices and the amount

80
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,530
we ate, then we need to set
some chart options.

81
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,050
Now these chart options,
there's a lot

82
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,190
of different options.

83
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,760
Most of them you can apply to
actually any visualization

84
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,220
that you want.

85
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,290
This one we're just going to
set a title, and then the

86
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,410
width and the height of what
the chart area is.

87
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,830
And finally, we'll construct
the chart object and

88
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,470
actually draw it.

89
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,550
And this is what we get.

90
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,370
It looks exactly the same as
it did in the other slide.

91
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,910
One other good thing to note is
that this is actually fully

92
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,930
interactive.

93
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,470
And you can see my mouse there.

94
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,170
Good.

95
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,150
And so when the user hovers
over, they can actually see

96
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,680
more details about each
of the data points.

97
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,390
So we're just highlighting
different things, and it's

98
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,520
giving us tool tips that provide
extra information

99
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,650
about our data.

100
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,210
So why would you want
to do this?

101
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,390
Why would you want to use charts
instead of just data

102
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,980
tables or HTML tables like
this to tell the

103
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,890
story of your data?

104
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,240
And it's really that.

105
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,810
It's the storytelling.

106
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,270
Being able to visually see
something is going to be much

107
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,560
more effective than having,
you know, Hamilton-Norwood

108
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,540
stage with a bunch of numbers.

109
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,720
I'm guessing not a lot of
people in here are even

110
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,550
familiar with the
Hamilton-Norwood stage.

111
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,160
I certainly wasn't before
I wrote this.

112
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
And so we can take this.

113
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,430
We can put it into
a data table.

114
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,060
And we can easily make a bunch
of different charts.

115
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,620
And these are some
very basic ones.

116
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,370
None of these really tell
the right story.

117
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,460
They don't really tell
you, what am I

118
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,440
trying to convey here?

119
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,890
We get a bunch of names,
but we don't--

120
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,580
what's going on?

121
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,170
So we can actually see, if we
tell the story correctly, what

122
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,220
we get is we get a story of how
the Google Visualization

123
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,640
Development Team is follically
challenged.

124
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,930
Not a lot of hair on the team.

125
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,480
We see Sergey, Dan, and
Jeremy, they're really

126
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,420
bringing in all the
hair to the team.

127
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,570
We're trying to get them
haircuts, but we'll see.

128
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,380
And so this is what I want to do
is, over the next half hour

129
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,470
or so, I want to tell a story.

130
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,330
And I want to tell a story using
all of the new features

131
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,500
that we've been working on for
the past year, to help you

132
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,710
tell stories with your data.

133
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,980

134
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,035
And again, this is fully
interactive.

135
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:24,470

136
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,810
So the story I'm gonna
tell you is about me.

137
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,340
And it's about me becoming
an adult.

138
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,820
There's been a lot of events
in my life recently where I

139
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,860
feel much more grown up
than I did really a

140
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,210
couple months ago.

141
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,930
I've talked to a lot of people
about becoming an adult.

142
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,370
Nobody really knows
what that means.

143
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,420
Are there any adults here?

144
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,870
I'm not seeing very
many hands at all.

145
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,390
So, I'm guessing you've
all experienced the

146
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,410
same things I have.

147
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,270
The first thing is
the timeline.

148
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,030
This is a brand new
visualization that we've been

149
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,140
working on.

150
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,870
And the ability to show
different points in history

151
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,440
and really tell the story.

152
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,790
So right here, you can see, I
got engaged in March of 2012.

153
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,670
Thank you.

154
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,030
Google I/O, giving this talk.

155
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,680
This is a pretty big grown
up moment for me.

156
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
There's a lot of people here.

157
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,000
A lot of people are going to
be watching this on YouTube

158
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,690
later on, hopefully.

159
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,320
So giving the I/O talk, that's
a reasonable amount of

160
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,780
responsibility.

161
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,820
Condo.

162
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,080
So I'm in the process of closing
on a condo right now.

163
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,830
I'm from Boston.

164
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,990
Real estate isn't quite as crazy
as it is here, but it's

165
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,630
still reasonably insane.

166
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,280
And married.

167
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,620
I mentioned I got engaged, we
have a wedding date set for

168
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,550
early September of this year.

169
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,600
So a lot of planning all
going on at once.

170
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,050
A lot of new responsibilities.

171
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,310
A lot of uncharted
territories.

172
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,980
And this timeline really helps
to show you how we have, kind

173
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,990
of, more things all scrunched
together at the end there then

174
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,040
I would have liked to deal with
at once, but there it is.

175
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,080
All right, so let's go over
the code for this.

176
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,250
If my clicker works.

177
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:03,550
All right.

178
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,980
So first thing is, you notice on
the previous visualizations

179
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,010
where I just had the basic bar
charts, is that here, we're

180
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,850
loading a new type
of visualization.

181
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,350
This isn't one of
our core charts.

182
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,560
So you can actually load this
independently from the core

183
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,700
chart package.

184
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,420
So we're loading the timeline
package instead here.

185
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,980
The basic steps are
still the same.

186
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,340
We're creating our data table.

187
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,240
We're using a little bit of
a different method here.

188
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,650
We're just converting a
JavaScript array directly into

189
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,590
a data table.

190
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,500
So once we have our data
table, and we have our

191
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,610
options, now we're just going
to construct our chart.

192
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,180
And the chart, instead of doing
column chart like we

193
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,000
were previously, we're
just doing timeline.

194
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,610
And the Google Visualization
API does all of

195
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,650
the work for you.

196
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,460
They figure out, OK, what are
the four best colors that will

197
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,510
contrast with each other nicely,
that's going to really

198
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,750
make this visualization pop?

199
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,870
What's going to stand
out the most?

200
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,070
How far apart should
all of the labels

201
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,490
be on the tick axis?

202
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,200
So you can see it shows a
quarterly interval here.

203
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,900
And it said, this is what's
really going to tell the story

204
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,890
the best; the most effectively
for you.

205
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,505
So all you have to do is provide
it your data, and it

206
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:18,030
will say, OK, I'll do all
the work for you.

207
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,060
But we can actually make this
a bit more complicated.

208
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,570
There's more than just
those four events.

209
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,220
I mean obviously, there's
a lot of work leading

210
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,990
up to each of those.

211
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,130
So you can see here, I went
ring shopping for about a

212
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,560
month and a half.

213
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,240
And engaged--

214
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,780
engaged isn't just a
point in time, it's

215
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,059
really a long term thing.

216
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,340
Well, in my case it's
a long term thing.

217
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,760
I'm going to be engaged about
a year and a half before

218
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,669
everything's said and done.

219
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,630
Buying the condo.

220
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,670
That is not a one
moment in time.

221
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,090
That is a long, long process.

222
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,830
Long process.

223
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,870
So we had to do condo
shopping.

224
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,460
And writing this I/O
presentation even

225
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,520
took a bunch of time.

226
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,710
So here you can see, instead of
just the one category here,

227
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,540
that just says grown up stuff,
now I have three separate

228
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,140
categories.

229
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,440
I have a relationship, a condo,
and the I/O category.

230
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,670
So you can further divide
your data to even more

231
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,870
clearly tell the story.

232
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,890
Now in order to do that, the
only difference here is I'm

233
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,840
providing, instead of
just one category--

234
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,880
so you can see where it
says relationship, and

235
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,740
condo, and I/O here--

236
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,340
it used to just say
grown up stuff.

237
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,750
We can see that back here.

238
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,810
See, it just says
grown up stuff.

239
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,920
So now I'm giving three
different categories.

240
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,950
And it's figuring out, OK, now
that I have these three

241
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,590
different categories, I
should put them all

242
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,840
onto different lines.

243
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,720

244
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,300
I'm also setting ranges now.

245
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,600
So instead of points in history,
like with the I/O

246
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,780
being today--

247
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,560
or two days ago, I guess
I have that set for--

248
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,520
we're setting a start date and
an end date, rather than just

249
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,960
a point in history.

250
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,170
But other than that,
everything's

251
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,630
pretty much the same.

252
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,860
We're not adding a ton of new
complexity to get this new

253
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,530
functionality.

254
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,960
And even still, we can actually
stack events on top

255
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,880
of each other within
a category.

256
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,690
So if you want to show
concurrency, or a schedule,

257
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,520
for example, you can do that.

258
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,120

259
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,750
So with the condo shopping, I've
had to talk to realtors,

260
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,440
banks, and lawyers.

261
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,520
Which are a fun group of
people to talk to.

262
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,100
Living together with
my fiancee.

263
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,280
So you can see when that
happened in perspective to

264
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,920
being engaged and
getting married.

265
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,800
Wedding planning, you
can see happened the

266
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,470
second we got engaged.

267
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,040
Probably a little bit earlier
for my fiancee.

268
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,830
That's right.

269
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,910
And these again, are completely
interactive.

270
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,120
So you'll be able to see the
exact date ranges, and all of

271
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,820
the information that
you want, through

272
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,170
the interaction events.

273
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,480
So you can just get a nice big
summary, and then you can

274
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,150
actually have your users drill
deeper into the data as

275
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,760
they're interacting with
the visualization.

276
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,370
So you can tell your story.

277
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,250
Again, just very, very basic.

278
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:08,000
We're just going to add some new
rows into our data table.

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,690
Nothing different about this
data, it just happens to

280
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,950
coincide at the same time
as other events.

281
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,510
So the visualization will just
stack the bars nicely on top

282
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,760
of each other.

283
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,800

284
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,390
That's a lot of stuff.

285
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,410
All right.

286
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,180
So that's the timeline
visualization.

287
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,820
Which is not available quite
yet, but it will be available

288
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,570
in about a week or so
in our version 1.1.

289
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,340
And I'll give you the links
for everything at the end.

290
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,420
Blood pressure.

291
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,710
So with all of these events
happening in my life, all at

292
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:48,030
the same time, it can get
a little stressful.

293
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,430
Get a little bit stressful.

294
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,880
And so, here we're seeing my
blood pressure over a course

295
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,010
of about six months, I'd say.

296
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,510
Taken once every 15 days.

297
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,140
It's all over the place.

298
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,290
It's up and down.

299
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:03,960
It's everywhere.

300
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,610
And actually, this isn't just
stressful for me, but it's

301
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,290
also stressful for my mother.

302
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,630
She's very concerned.

303
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,480
She still thinks of me as a
six-year-old that needs

304
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,120
everything taken care of.

305
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,900
I love you Mom, but relax.

306
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,350
So this is a scatter chart.

307
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,330
Let's drill into how we make
this scatter chart.

308
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:29,320
Now there's a lot more data on
this visualization then with

309
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,900
the previous visualizations.

310
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,580
So we're going to move all of
our data table setup to

311
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,720
another function, just so I
can fit it on two slides.

312
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,200
And all it is, is a date,
and then two values.

313
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,500
It's systolic, if you're really
concerned about what

314
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,630
these blood pressure
numbers mean.

315
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,310
And we're just building
our data table.

316
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,860
And here, the only different
thing is, where we're saying,

317
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,750
draw a scatter chart.

318
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,780
Now we could have had a
line chart to plot the

319
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,870
lines, if we wanted.

320
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,380
But other than that, everything
is very simple.

321
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,150
And then the visualization
library is taking care of

322
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,680
everything for us.

323
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,140
Now, when you make something
like a scatter chart, what

324
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,130
you're really trying to do is
your saying, here are my data

325
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,710
points, but there's gotta to be
a pattern here somewhere.

326
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,520
We want to see the trends.

327
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,920
And so to help you make these
trends, what we did was we add

328
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,520
in automatic trend
line calculation.

329
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,400
So that's just saying, given
this set of data, I want a

330
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,100
linear trend line.

331
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,700
And you can actually
go over here.

332
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,970
So you can see, on March 1, my
blood pressure was at 140.

333
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,140
My mother's was at 130.

334
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,145
So I was actually a little more
stressed out that day

335
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:40,740
than she was.

336
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,960
And you can also see along the
different trend lines, what

337
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,590
both the formula for the trend
line is, and what the

338
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,120
calculated value should be,
what is the expected value

339
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,990
based on that trend line.

340
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,330
You can go on, you can compare
all of these numbers.

341
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,800
And it's really a nice
interactive experience for

342
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,540
telling your story.

343
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,020
And you can see here, I am
getting more stressed out as

344
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,950
time goes on, but my mother is
about to explode any minute

345
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,810
now, really.

346
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,490
So let's take a look at
how we add in these

347
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,380
automatic trend lines.

348
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,530
Again, we're doing the data
table set up on the previous

349
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,420
slide, with the get blood
pressure data table function.

350
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,510
All we're doing here to get
the trend lines is we're

351
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,130
saying, in our options, add
a couple of trend lines to

352
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,740
series zero and series one.

353
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,350
You'll notice it says
type "linear".

354
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,670
We can also do exponential
if we feel that's more

355
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,440
appropriate for our data.

356
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,950
But it's very, very simple, and
we want to expose this to

357
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,610
everybody, so you can better
see these patterns in your

358
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,400
data, so you can better
tell your story.

359
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,140

360
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,750
And one more look
at this table.

361
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,310

362
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,460
All right.

363
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,530
Condo shopping, was
another big part.

364
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,440
If anybody's ever--

365
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,470
even if you've just gone
looking for apartments,

366
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,450
there's a lot of data.

367
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,850
You have square footage, versus
time to work, versus

368
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,440
how much is it going
to cost you.

369
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,150
All kinds of different
variables.

370
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,470
One of the ways you can actually
display a lot of

371
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,500
these variables all at once
is with a bubble chart.

372
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,660
So this is something that
already exists today.

373
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,950
And we have this bubble chart.

374
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:27,460
So you can see, on the y-axis,
we have the size of unit.

375
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,240
We have how much the unit
costs on the x-axis.

376
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,520
The size of the bubble
corresponds to

377
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,640
how far it is from--

378
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,500
how much of a commute
it will be to work.

379
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,530
And the color of the bubble is
the number of fireplaces.

380
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,640
I really want a fireplace
in my place.

381
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,790
So I figured I'd put
that up there too.

382
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,640
And you can hover over these
and see exactly the exact

383
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,590
details of all of these.

384
00:15:54,590 --> 00:16:02,200
You can say, OK, list price is
$319,900 for this place.

385
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,090
And it's going to take me 41
minutes to get to work.

386
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,630
So this was a really useful way
for my fiancee and I to

387
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,720
see all of these different
listings all at once.

388
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,400
So let's see how exactly
I draw that.

389
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,270

390
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,130
The first thing I'm doing here
is you're going to notice a

391
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,020
couple of different options
that are more for just the

392
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,950
bubble chart.

393
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,120
And so you have--

394
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm manually setting the labels
for these, as well as

395
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,930
setting a style on the bubble.

396
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,640
I thought the text on the bubble
was a little too big,

397
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,700
so I made it a little smaller.

398
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,880
And this is just one of the many
things you can customize.

399
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,750
I'm drawing a bubble chart this
time, instead of a line

400
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,890
chart or a scatter chart
or a timeline.

401
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,660
So I just call a bubble
chart instead.

402
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,370
You might also know this,
are people in here

403
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,890
familiar with jQuery?

404
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,050
Just, you've heard of it?

405
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,560
Yes.

406
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,470
Everybody's heard of jQuery.

407
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,750
All right.

408
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,490
Awesome.

409
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,610
jQuery is a library that
provides a number of

410
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,430
convenience methods, is one of
the many things it does.

411
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,250
And here, what it's doing is
it's actually making an XML

412
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,040
request for a blob
of JSON, that

413
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,069
actually has all the data.

414
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,560
And I'll show you what
that data looks like.

415
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,079
So this is just a JSON file
that I had generated.

416
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,750
It has the addresses, the
prices, it rips all these from

417
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,670
various real estate
listing websites.

418
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,230
You'll notice that the end of
each row here is a URL.

419
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,650
And I'm not really doing
anything with this URL.

420
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:32,100
On my chart here, once I decide,
OK, 358 Lexington

421
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,730
Street here is worth
looking at.

422
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,700
So how do I say, OK, I want
to go look at this?

423
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,950
How do I know?

424
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,510
So we actually added this
functionality, actions.

425
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,810
And so with the actions API, you
can actually go in and add

426
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,060
more interactive elements
to your tool tips.

427
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,210
In this case it would be really
useful if I could just

428
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,420
click on this, and then view
this on the listing website.

429
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,900
So if I click on that--

430
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,120
I'm not connected
to the internet.

431
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,420
All right.

432
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,940
That's OK.

433
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,500
It comes up with a beautiful
picture of the house, and

434
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,010
maybe a map, and how much it
costs, and the real estate

435
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,810
agent I would need to
get in touch with.

436
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,410
And this is something that's
really made it much easier for

437
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,480
us to find a place to live.

438
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,470
And this was not, I mean this
is not a lot of code.

439
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,850
And it's much, much nicer than
most of the tools out there

440
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,210
that I've found.

441
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,670
So, to add the action.

442
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,230
How do we do this?

443
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,610
This is a little bit different
than we've seen

444
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,620
in our other features.

445
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,750
What we're doing here is, after
we've constructed the

446
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,640
chart object, our bubble chart,
we're going to set an

447
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,420
action on it.

448
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,916
And the majority of stuff, the
juicy bits of this, is really

449
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,970
this action function here.

450
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,520
The action function says, when
I click on that little label

451
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,360
inside the tool tip, what
do we do with it?

452
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,210
And so all I do is I want
to get the selection.

453
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,560
I already have the URL that's
in the data table.

454
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,640
So I want to say, OK, based on
my selection, I want to get

455
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,960
the cell with the URL
from the row.

456
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,010
So we're going to get
the selection.

457
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,410
And then we're going to get the
value at the fifth column.

458
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,830
And then we're going
to open the URL.

459
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,810
And that's all there is to it.

460
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,660
I mean, it's just JavaScript,
so you can do anything you

461
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,120
want within that function.

462
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,220
And really, this was like an
incredibly useful tool when

463
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,980
searching for real estate.

464
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,600
It really helps to visualize
where everything is, how far

465
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,590
away everything is, rather than
just looking at pictures

466
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,110
of the inside.

467
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,450
You can really see a
lot of data all the

468
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,700
once with the bubble.

469
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,820

470
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,840
So that was a very
good experience.

471
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,290
Hopefully the closing
will go well.

472
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,550
The wedding.

473
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,650
The wedding there's a lot--

474
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,850
I have a very big family.

475
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,110
I have a big international
family.

476
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,930
They're coming from all
over the place.

477
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,670
And it's tough to visualize
stuff like this.

478
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,190
So we actually do offer
a geochart.

479
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,430
And the geochart's going to
show us where all of these

480
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,390
wedding guests are
coming from.

481
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,800
And we can see, OK, I've got a
lot of people from Greenland,

482
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,200
it looks like, and some Irish
relatives, and a couple of

483
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,140
people from the Ukraine, and
maybe one guy from Spain.

484
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,230
And you can map out all
the data you want.

485
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,170
And these will be geocoded
for you.

486
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,360
So let's take a look at how
we're constructing this data.

487
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,590
So I'm not actually providing
anything complicated for my

488
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,480
data table.

489
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,780
I'm providing just the
name of the country.

490
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,650
Common names here going to be
cached by the library, so you

491
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,660
won't need to make a network
request to figure out, OK,

492
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,630
what is Ireland?

493
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,590
Where is that on my map?

494
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,460
It'll actually just know that.

495
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,660
More complex names, if you want
to provide longitude and

496
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,590
latitude, it'll make a geocoding
request to the

497
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,940
Google Maps API.

498
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,710
And this is all done
automatically for you.

499
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,470
So here we're just saying the
region that the guests are

500
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,530
coming from, and then
the number of guests

501
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,670
coming from that area.

502
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,530
Here we need to load a different
package than we've

503
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,210
loaded before.

504
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,240
We're going to load the
geochart package.

505
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,450
And then we're going to
construct the geochart object.

506
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,790
So very, very simple to
create a geochart.

507
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,960
But if you look, this is
actually a Mercator

508
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,300
projection.

509
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,030
And a Mercator projection
is basically how

510
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,730
you're going to--

511
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,030
a map projection first of all,
is how you're going to take

512
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,880
the globe, and translate
it to a flat surface?

513
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,630
And here is the Mercator
projection.

514
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,420
And this Mercator projection
is very common.

515
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,200
I'm sure you've all seen
a map of the world

516
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,420
that looks like this.

517
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,070
And it was really designed
for marine navigation.

518
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,800
And that's pretty much it.

519
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,000
And that's pretty much
all it's useful for.

520
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,200
And if you look at Greenland,
it's giant.

521
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,890
It's bigger than Africa.

522
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,780
Mercator, you're going to take
something, and you're going to

523
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:52,680
stretch it out such that if you
were to go directly side

524
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,230
to side here, so you go from
Maine, you would end up

525
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,440
somewhere in France.

526
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,350
Exactly east.

527
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,740
But this isn't really too useful
for seeing things.

528
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,990
When I was a little kid, and
I knew my relatives from

529
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,490
Greenland, I thought they
must be super powerful.

530
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,850
Because Greenland must
be super powerful,

531
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,170
because it's giant.

532
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,650
But Mercator really isn't
appropriate here.

533
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,620
So we've added the ability
to have different map

534
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,440
projections.

535
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,690
So you can decide what is the
best way to show this data.

536
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,290
And this is a Kavrayskiy VII.

537
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,490
And this map projection is
going to give you minimal

538
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,990
distortion.

539
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,610
So here you can see, wow,
Greenland is a much more

540
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,910
reasonable size.

541
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,380
Australia is a much more
reasonable size.

542
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,660
Everything looks
in proportion.

543
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,690
And this projection is really
designed so that each of the

544
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,090
individual regions are
minimally distorted.

545
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,590
So to change my visualization
to have a different

546
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,450
projection, all I'm doing here
is adding another option.

547
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,120
And this option is just going
to say, OK, I want not the

548
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,930
default projection.

549
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,680
I want to specify
the Kavrayskiy

550
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,140
VII projection instead.

551
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,020

552
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,080
So we can go back, and
we can see a much

553
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,530
nicer view of the world.

554
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,800
I also have a lot of people
visiting from within the

555
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,830
United States.

556
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,180
You can see the view of the
United States here.

557
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,510
Again, it's a little
stretched out.

558
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,550
This is the Mercator
projection again.

559
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,510
This isn't really what the
United States looks like.

560
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,290
Everything's kind of distorted,
the further you

561
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,970
venture away from the equator.

562
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,490
But in order to construct this,
we're just passing the

563
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,430
state codes.

564
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,300
And most of these are
cached again.

565
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,370
So we're creating our data table
with all of the states

566
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,780
and the number of visitors.

567
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,550
In order to zoom in on a
specific region, we're just

568
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,150
going to provide that
in the options.

569
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,390
So in this case, we want
to view the US region.

570
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,500

571
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,200
And we have our Mercator
projection

572
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,110
of the United States.

573
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,360
But a more appropriate
projection for the United

574
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,650
States is the Albers
projection.

575
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,110
And this is actually what I'm
used to seeing when I see a

576
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,430
map of the United
States, is this.

577
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,010
So in order to specify this
projection, we're going to,

578
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,430
again, give it the projection
option.

579
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,000
But this one's a little
different.

580
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,560
This one you're able to
specify parallels.

581
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,780
And some projections
require you to

582
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,520
specify these parallels.

583
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,140
Where is the projection
essentially centered around?

584
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,820
So this might be 29 and 1/2, 45
and 1/2, that's appropriate

585
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,550
for the United States.

586
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,270
But it might not be appropriate
for the European

587
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,920
Union, for example.

588
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,270
So these are good ones.

589
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,320
It will choose these by
default, if you want.

590
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,460
But these are ones I wanted
to hand pick.

591
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,140

592
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,600
So again, we can see the
Albers, the equal area.

593
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,170
And we can actually go back
and compare a little.

594
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:49,070
So if you look at Minnesota
and Florida, and how they

595
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,770
really shift between the two.

596
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,140
And even that the distance,
you can see Maine and

597
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,360
Washington kind of
coming together.

598
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,590
It really demonstrates the
amount of distortion that each

599
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,450
of the projections
is making up for.

600
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,312

601
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:09,220
All right.

602
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,540
Get you guys out of here
and get you to lunch.

603
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,600
So our new features.

604
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,380
We had the new visualization in
the timeline visualization.

605
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,400
We added the ability to
add in trend lines.

606
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,730
We have actions, new
interactions

607
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,590
for our tool tips.

608
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,810
And map projections, for more

609
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,830
appropriately displaying geocharts.

610
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,900
And all of this is for free,
and you see this at

611
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,190
developers.google.com/chart.

612
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,950
And it's a simple
JavaScript API.

613
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,406
And that's about all I had.

614
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:45,350
[AUDIENCE CLAPS]

615
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,600
MITCHELL FOLEY: Thank you.

616
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,550

617
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,560
If anyone has any questions, I'm
happy to take questions.

618
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:59,810

619
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,985
AUDIENCE: Just a quick one.

620
00:26:00,985 --> 00:26:03,960
Ken Anderson from University
of Colorado.

621
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,280
I've been really excited to
learn more about Dart while

622
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,950
I've been here.

623
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:11,260
And I'm wondering what is the
timeline, or are there plans

624
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,190
in place to integrate services
like these in to Dart?

625
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,260
Because right now, I don't know
how easy it is to call

626
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,110
existing JavaScript libraries
straight from Dart.

627
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,370
MITCHELL FOLEY: So, I know of
no way currently, with Dart.

628
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,770
We haven't discussed this
with our team at all.

629
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,480
I will say that we have worked
a lot with GWT, Google Web

630
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,370
Toolkit, so we do have GWT
wrappers for all of these.

631
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,840
But as far as Dart, if you can
call JavaScript code from

632
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,950
Dart, then you'll be able
to call this from Dart.

633
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,360
But there are no specific
Dart wrappers.

634
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,260
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

635
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,980
AUDIENCE: Timothy Wall
with CloudLock.

636
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,140
I'm looking forward to seeing
the timeline come out.

637
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,340
I've currently got a
visualization based on Google

638
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,230
App Engine costs over time.

639
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,710
MITCHELL FOLEY: OK.

640
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,030
AUDIENCE: So we can see the
usage and spiking of costs.

641
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,490
And we also have that mapped
in with another data source

642
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,940
that shows sort of what's
going in the

643
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,900
application at the time.

644
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,480
So we end up having a
lot of events there.

645
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,540
And the default formatting for
injecting, I guess they're

646
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,570
called annotations, into the
graph is rather limited.

647
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,780
Do you have any plans, or is
there anything upcoming to

648
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,330
allow more customization of the
annotations that are put

649
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,020
on a given visualization?

650
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,620
MITCHELL FOLEY: We're absolutely
looking into adding

651
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,000
more customizations
all the time.

652
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,070
My recommendation would
be to complain on the

653
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,290
public mailing list.

654
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,060
We really do listen to
everything on all of the

655
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,000
mailing lists that we receive.

656
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,050
We have had some complaints
from--

657
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,790
well, had some feature
requests, to add more

658
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,710
annotations.

659
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,350
I don't think I can talk about
specific schedules or promise

660
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,660
anything right now.

661
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,210
AUDIENCE: I noticed with the
action, it looked like the

662
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,780
specific data around that
had been formatted in

663
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,460
a particular way.

664
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,810
I don't know if that was
customized or if that's the

665
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,940
default presentation.

666
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,240
MITCHELL FOLEY: That was
actually the default

667
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,000
customization.

668
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,980
I was running that exact code
to make that presentation.

669
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,150
I think I might have changed the
size a little bit for the

670
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:07,415
presentation.

671
00:28:07,415 --> 00:28:10,480
But other than that, that
was the default.

672
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,990
There is some customization.

673
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,710
And we're always looking to
improve the customizability of

674
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,740
our product.

675
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,910
Yep.

676
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,500
AUDIENCE: So I know you said the
colors are chosen kind of

677
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,820
based on what pops the most.

678
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,310
Is there any way to override
that for branding purposes for

679
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,820
certain companies who
want to use their

680
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,220
colors in their logo?

681
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,660
MITCHELL FOLEY: Absolutely.

682
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,420
It's not always appropriate
to use the default colors.

683
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,250
For example, sometimes red,
you'll want to be indicating a

684
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,860
high number, like with
temperature.

685
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,160
But sometimes you want
it to be a low

686
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,010
number, like with money.

687
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,720
So yes, there are ways.

688
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,340
And read all about them on
developers.google.com/charts.

689
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,530
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

690
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,295
MITCHELL FOLEY: No problem.

691
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:52,680
AUDIENCE: Hi.

692
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,210
Is there any intention to make
this available within Android

693
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,130
apps, rather than
just on the web?

694
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,210
MITCHELL FOLEY: Mobile is
a very important part of

695
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,880
Google's strategy as a whole.

696
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,860
Right now, these charts
will output to SVG.

697
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,280
We are actively working
to make them better.

698
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,610
Adding in support for touch
events, for example.

699
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,415
But they will render just
fine right now on

700
00:29:16,415 --> 00:29:18,592
a native web browser.

701
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:19,018
AUDIENCE: OK.

702
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:19,870
Thanks.

703
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,270
MITCHELL FOLEY: Thanks.

704
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,260
AUDIENCE: You showed a number
of the, for example, the

705
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,640
timeline charts.

706
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,670
Is there a way to have two of
the charts kind of stacked one

707
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,230
above each other?

708
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,150
So using your example again,
showing not just your blood

709
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,720
pressure chart, but showing that
over the timeline chart,

710
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,820
and being able to have a
vertical line move between

711
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,620
them to show where you are
looking at any given point?

712
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,240
MITCHELL FOLEY: So we do have
the ability for you to add an

713
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,030
arbitrary number of charts
onto a page.

714
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,690
As far as adding a line right
down the middle, we don't have

715
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,230
support for that yet.

716
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,820
But we do have the ability to
build dashboards, where you

717
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,840
can transform your data,
for all of your

718
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,460
charts, all at once.

719
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,930
So you can have the data
change the range.

720
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,405
So you can go through
time like that.

721
00:30:05,405 --> 00:30:05,720
AUDIENCE: OK.

722
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,140
MITCHELL FOLEY: But as far as
the line, that specific way of

723
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,320
showing that story,
we don't yet.

724
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,420
AUDIENCE: So, putting multiple
charts on a page at the time,

725
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,730
that's just a matter
of putting in two

726
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,840
divs and having them--

727
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,180
MITCHELL FOLEY: Absolutely.

728
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,150
AUDIENCE: More or less aligned
with each other.

729
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,190
MITCHELL FOLEY: Yes.

730
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,940
AUDIENCE: OK.

731
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,340
MITCHELL FOLEY: Yep.

732
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,030
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

733
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,420
MITCHELL FOLEY: No problem.

734
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,000
AUDIENCE: I'm excited about the
timeline charts as well.

735
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,450
I was wondering if there's
a way to specify your

736
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,950
own metric for time?

737
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:34,140
Like if you wanted to do
geologic epochs or something

738
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,420
like that, and still
use those tools.

739
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,530
MITCHELL FOLEY: So in addition
to passing in dates, you can

740
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,410
just pass in numbers.

741
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,880
It will try to convert those
to dates, and it does a

742
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,130
reasonably good job.

743
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,230

744
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,380
I guess beyond that,
there's not a lot.

745
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,350
It will display no matter what
numbers you put in there.

746
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,270
So there's that.

747
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,000
I would recommend, once it's
released, play around with it,

748
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,480
and see if it fits your needs.

749
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,690
And if it doesn't,
let us know.

750
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,440
Really let us know.

751
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:05,670
AUDIENCE: OK.

752
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,880
MITCHELL FOLEY: We're always
looking for more feedback.

753
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,660
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

754
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,840
MITCHELL FOLEY: Thank you.

755
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,190
AUDIENCE: Hi.

756
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:16,400
I think Google Visualization
API is a static chart by

757
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,970
static data, from my
understanding.

758
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:24,600
So do you have a plan to develop
real-time chat by

759
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,560
updating Ajax or WebSockets,
something like that?

760
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:28,690
MITCHELL FOLEY: I'm sorry.

761
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,650
Could you repeat the question?

762
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,490
AUDIENCE: So do you
have a plan to

763
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,810
develop a real-time chart?

764
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,750
I think Google chart is
static chart, I think.

765
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:43,330
Do you have plans of updating
by the Ajax or WebSockets,

766
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,740
visualize in real time?

767
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,790
MITCHELL FOLEY: We don't provide
that, however you can

768
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,850
just update the chart.

769
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,700
So if you write a--

770
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,500
if you have it at
a set interval

771
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,200
on a page, for example.

772
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,520
And you're saying,
redraw the chart.

773
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,072
So you can see, let me
go back to some code.

774
00:32:01,072 --> 00:32:01,882
AUDIENCE: You have
transformations on

775
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:03,502
charts, don't you?

776
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:04,480
MITCHELL FOLEY: Absolutely.

777
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,450
So right here, where we're
going chart.draw--

778
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:07,920
AUDIENCE: Ahh.

779
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,590
MITCHELL FOLEY: --you can save
that chart object and just

780
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,110
call chart.draw again,
with different data

781
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,150
and different options.

782
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

783
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,300
MITCHELL FOLEY: And we actually
do have animation

784
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,520
transitions between
those two states.

785
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:18,950
AUDIENCE: OK.

786
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,730
Thank you.

787
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,020
MITCHELL FOLEY: Thank you.

788
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,020
AUDIENCE: In fact, a similar
question here.

789
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,980
The use case is like a livestock
price scenario where

790
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,390
there's data that streams--

791
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:33,480
comes in every minute or two,
and instead of reloading all

792
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,770
the JSON data table, is there
a way to just feed the delta

793
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,160
that we have for the last
minute into the chart?

794
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,780
MITCHELL FOLEY: You
could certainly

795
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,070
add onto a data table--

796
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,300
AUDIENCE: OK.

797
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,770
MITCHELL FOLEY: Once
you've finished

798
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,300
constructing the data table.

799
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,740
AUDIENCE: And then I
will do draw again?

800
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,270
MITCHELL FOLEY: Yes.

801
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,900
So you can say, OK, add this
data, remove this data, and

802
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,560
then redraw.

803
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,480
Or just add data, or
just remove data.

804
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,430
Whatever you'd like to do.

805
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,000
AUDIENCE: If I just add data,
it won't draw automatically?

806
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,960
I have to programmatically
call the draw?

807
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,340
MITCHELL FOLEY: Correct.

808
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,330
You just have to have that
one extra call where it's

809
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:01,880
chart.draw.

810
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,000
AUDIENCE: I see, thank you.

811
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,252
MITCHELL FOLEY: Thank you.

812
00:33:04,252 --> 00:33:04,650
AUDIENCE: Hi.

813
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,650
I was wondering if you have any
options to download the

814
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,720
data table on the client?

815
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,610
MITCHELL FOLEY: You
can convert data

816
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,520
tables to a JSON string.

817
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,340
And so you can expose that
functionality to your users.

818
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,190
And then you can actually
provide just a JSON blob to

819
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,070
the data table to reconstruct
it in a different context.

820
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,530
AUDIENCE: OK.

821
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,070
Thanks.

822
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,690
MITCHELL FOLEY: Thank you.

823
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,570
AUDIENCE: Hi.

824
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,520
I was looking at the scatter
graph, and I was wondering if

825
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,410
there is an option to
provide threshold.

826
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,790
For example, you had blood
pressure, and I want to look

827
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,510
at blood pressure beyond
certain numbers.

828
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,280
Say 140, red.

829
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,720
And below a certain number, bad,
it's low blood pressure.

830
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,910
So can you visualize that in
the scatter graph or some

831
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,070
other form of graph?

832
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,450
MITCHELL FOLEY: Yes.

833
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,570
So I mentioned, in addition to
providing just the raw data

834
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,070
table, you can also
set attributes.

835
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,650
And one of the things
you can set is--

836
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,150
my goodness, I forget the
term that we use off

837
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,450
the top of my head.

838
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,230
But you can--

839
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,000
ah, roles.

840
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,390
You can assign roles.

841
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,110
And so you can assign a scope
role to a piece of data and

842
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,370
say, this is out of scope
or this is in scope.

843
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,389
And it will color that
data appropriately.

844
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,320
So if you want to only highlight
the ones that are

845
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,929
within the range, you can
assign a scope role

846
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,522
to do that for you.

847
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:18,914
AUDIENCE: OK.

848
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:19,699
Thank you.

849
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,702
MITCHELL FOLEY: Thank you.

850
00:34:21,702 --> 00:34:26,949
AUDIENCE: Are these controlled
ADA compliant?

851
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:27,810
MITCHELL FOLEY: I'm sorry,
say that one more time.

852
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,790
AUDIENCE: The timeline and
all this visualization

853
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,130
controllers, are they
ADA compliant?

854
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,020
ADA compliant, section 503.

855
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,270
The accessibility?

856
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,270

857
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:39,909
MITCHELL FOLEY: No.

858
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,150
Not yet.

859
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,699
We are working on-- there's
actually some really exciting

860
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,100
things that we're working
on right now.

861
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,980
AUDIENCE: OK.

862
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,130
MITCHELL FOLEY: They are not
finished, but we are thinking

863
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,675
about accessibility, and we'll
hopefully have a better answer

864
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:53,940
for you shortly.

865
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,350
AUDIENCE: OK.

866
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:54,710
Thank you.

867
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,396
MITCHELL FOLEY: Thank you.

868
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:57,770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

869
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,860
When I look at all the
[INAUDIBLE], like just give

870
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,050
"Ireland" and map Ireland
automatically, it looks really

871
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,430
like Fusion Table.

872
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:06,780
MITCHELL FOLEY: Mm hmm.

873
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,230
AUDIENCE: Functionality.

874
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,770
What's the plan in the future
between Fusion Table and

875
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:15,460
releasing all of
those features?

876
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,980
MITCHELL FOLEY: Could you say
that one more time please?

877
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,270
AUDIENCE: What's a roadmap
behind it having all those

878
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,210
features for [INAUDIBLE]
developers to

879
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,620
integrate in the website?

880
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,300
And right now going through
Fusion Table, to have the same

881
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,890
results and same story at
the end of the day?

882
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,810
MITCHELL FOLEY: Are you asking
about Fusion Tables?

883
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,280
AUDIENCE: Yes.

884
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,150
MITCHELL FOLEY: I honestly
don't know too much about

885
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,400
Fusion Tables.

886
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,450

887
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,882
Does anybody have any idea?

888
00:35:41,882 --> 00:35:42,866
AUDIENCE: It's a
Google product.

889
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:45,330
It comes from Google, too.

890
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,390
MITCHELL FOLEY: Believe it or
not, they don't consult me on

891
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,400
everything.

892
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,880
I have my charts and graphs
and stuff, but I actually

893
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,000
don't know too much about Fusion
Tables, I'm very sorry.

894
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,164
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

895
00:35:56,164 --> 00:35:57,120
MITCHELL FOLEY: Yes?

896
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,280
AUDIENCE: So, if I want to set
the scale on the chart on the

897
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,290
side, do I have other ways to
do besides just a static

898
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:10,250
linear chart that encompasses
all the data?

899
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,225
Can I have data that's off the
chart and just have that sort

900
00:36:13,225 --> 00:36:17,080
of disconnected and appear
above it, and say this is

901
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,550
constrained to between
80 and 120, or

902
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,420
whatever the values are?

903
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:20,860
MITCHELL FOLEY: Yes.

904
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,420
AUDIENCE: And also, can you
do a non-linear scale?

905
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:23,850
MITCHELL FOLEY: Yes.

906
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,380
AUDIENCE: Can I do a

907
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,535
logarithmic scale, for example?

908
00:36:25,535 --> 00:36:25,810
MITCHELL FOLEY: Yes.

909
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,960
Both of those, absolutely.

910
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,380
You can set the axis
scale yourself.

911
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,940
You can set the start and
end points for anything.

912
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,500
You can also set custom
logarithmic scales for

913
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,460
everything.

914
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,110
Including the points at which
you want to show on the axis.

915
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,920
All of that's documented
on the site.

916
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,350
AUDIENCE: OK.

917
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,020
Thanks.

918
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,260
MITCHELL FOLEY: Thank you.

919
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,330
AUDIENCE: I am really excited
to hear about

920
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,170
1.1 coming out soon.

921
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,480
I was wondering if there were
any other new charts in 1.1,

922
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,816
or if there were any other new
releases with new charts in it

923
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:58,420
in the upcoming roadmap?

924
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,670
MITCHELL FOLEY: So right
now, the only brand new

925
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,600
visualization is the timeline.

926
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,260
We do want to eventually
provide even more

927
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,380
visualizations.

928
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,160
As far as 1.0 versus 1.1,
1.0 is always the

929
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,440
current stable version.

930
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,410
1.1 is always the
beta version.

931
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,170
So eventually we'll merge
1.1 to be 1.0.

932
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,910

933
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,230
It's our numbering scheme.

934
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,700
I don't know what to tell
you about that.

935
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,530
AUDIENCE: So when's the
next 1.1 coming?

936
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,410
MITCHELL FOLEY: In
about a week.

937
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,930
In about a week, you'll be able
to play around, you'll

938
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,840
have timelines on 1.1, and be
able to play around with that.

939
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,530
Hopefully another month after
we get the testing and any

940
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:42,150
bugs fixed, we'll get that out
in maybe a month or so after.

941
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,310
AUDIENCE: OK.

942
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,695
So are there any more new charts
coming in the next six

943
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:47,936
to 12 months?

944
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:48,882
MITCHELL FOLEY: Yes.

945
00:37:48,882 --> 00:37:51,250
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

946
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

947
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,730
MITCHELL FOLEY: Thank you.

948
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,250
Any more questions?

949
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,160
OK, well, if there's not, I'm
happy to stick around for a

950
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,440
couple minutes.

951
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,030
Thank you for coming, and
enjoy your lunch.

952
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,427
