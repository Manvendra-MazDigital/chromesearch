1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,455

2
00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:01,880
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Hey everyone.

3
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,630
My name is Aparna.

4
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,305
I'm a Product Manager
at Google.

5
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:07,000
I have Roy and Iein with me.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,300
We are from the Knowledge Team
at Google, so this is the

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,240
first time our team is doing
these developer sessions at

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,600
I/O around structured
data and knowledge.

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,900
So we hope you like it, and let
us know what you think for

10
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,430
the next year.

11
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,300
So our talk today is about
bringing relevant information

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,640
from the inbox to the search box
and new experiences like

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,720
Google Now.

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,830
How many of you use Google
Now or have tried it?

15
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,340
OK, all right.

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,980
And we're going to talk about
how both as users, you can see

17
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,110
some of the new features we
are building and kinds of

18
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,740
problems that we are trying to
solve, but also from the

19
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,500
developer angle.

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,870
Like I said, we'll start with
the user experience.

21
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,760
We'll give you a sense of the
user problems we're trying to

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,330
solve, features we're building,
maybe throw in a few

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,070
demos, and then switch gears
and say, OK, how can you as

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,050
developers be part of
this experience?

25
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,220
How many of you attended the
keynote yesterday morning?

26
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,950
How many of you saw
the search, the

27
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,310
conversational search?

28
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,910
How many of you thought
it was not bad?

29
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,580
Really good?

30
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,650
OK.

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,600
So you saw Amit and Johanna
give you a glimpse of the

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,300
future of search and
where we are going.

33
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,730
And in this talk, I'll go a
little bit deeper and show you

34
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,780
some of these examples of how
we are pushing the edge in

35
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,670
terms of saying, look, the
future of search is being

36
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,090
conversational and
an assistant.

37
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,420
So for the next few moments, I'm
going to treat this half

38
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,470
of the room as my user
half and this half as

39
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,010
my developer half.

40
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,170
So a quick question
to the user half.

41
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,880
How many of you look
for information

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,515
in your emails often?

43
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:47,060

44
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,660
And question for the
developer half.

45
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,880
Do you send information to
your users, important

46
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,750
information, in the emails &mdash;

47
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,050
confirmations, notifications,
stuff that you

48
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,300
want them to remember?

49
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,570

50
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,520
So here's the problem.

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,690
You guys are sending information
to these guys, but

52
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,810
then what's happening is this.

53
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,259
So is the person next to you, so
is that guy behind you, and

54
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,190
that woman in the back, she's
sending email too.

55
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,480
And before you know it, these
guys are getting flooded with

56
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,470
all of these emails and
important information, but

57
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,560
it's really impossible for you
to find that one single

58
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,520
nugget, one single answer, one
single piece of information

59
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,850
that you need at the
time you need it.

60
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,560
And to make it really concrete,
let me give you a

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,070
specific personal example.

62
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,750
So this morning I woke up, I
had one simple question.

63
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,650
What hotel am I staying at?

64
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,145
So you see I have a flight
coming up tomorrow morning, an

65
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:41,660
early morning flight, and I
have this talk, and I have

66
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,050
another event this evening.

67
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,140
I figured I should just stay
the night in the city.

68
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,680
So I wanted to mention my hotel

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,090
information to my husband.

70
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,980
It took me five steps just
to get to that answer.

71
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:00,320
So first step, you can't see
this here, but I'll talk you

72
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,950
through it.

73
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,800
The first step is I had to
actually swipe past all these

74
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,550
goddamn apps on my phone
and then open Gmail.

75
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,040
The second step, I had to map
the natural question that

76
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,920
popped up in my head.

77
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,180
I had to say, what hotel
am I staying at?

78
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,460
And then turn this into this
robotic set of keywords that I

79
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,330
thought Google could
understand.

80
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,890
So I had to say, OK, maybe I
should say "hotel" and the

81
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,140
provider that actually
sent me that email.

82
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,840
That's the second step.

83
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,680
And then third step, I basically
had to say, well,

84
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,590
now I have to make sure that I
peck at my keyboard and type

85
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,470
these queries on a tiny device,
and make sure that I'm

86
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,040
not doing any typos because it's
a pain to type it again.

87
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,090
Fourth step, then I see a bunch
of these email results.

88
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,590
They all look the same, and I
have to make a guess and say,

89
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,440
maybe one of these emails
has an answer.

90
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,230
Then comes the final step and
say, OK, I click open the

91
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,280
email, wade past all the
information, all the words

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,970
that I don't quite need, just to
get that one single answer

93
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,560
which says, it's the
Marriott next door.

94
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,470

95
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,010
Five steps just to get
to that answer.

96
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,430
We think it should be much
easier, and those of who saw

97
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,170
the keynote know that one of the
ways that we want to make

98
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,370
it easier is say, you
ask a question &mdash;

99
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,730
in fact, you speak your
mind to the phone &mdash;

100
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,000
and we get you the answer.

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,089
One single step.

102
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,520
Because by the time I'm done
with these five steps this

103
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,430
morning, my husband was on the
fifth page of Hacker News.

104
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,920
I want it to be in
one single shot.

105
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,800
So we said, OK.

106
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,130
This morning, I came in and
said, team, we must fix this.

107
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,180
And in the last few hours,
we've basically solved

108
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,030
everything.

109
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,280
Kidding, of course.

110
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,240

111
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,740
If you think about it, going
from a question to an answer

112
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,850
in one step requires us to be
solving really hard problems

113
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,800
from the technical side.

114
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
First hard problem we'll
have to solve is speech

115
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,850
recognition, understanding
what you're

116
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,300
saying to the phone.

117
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,090
The second hard problem we'll
have to solve is understanding

118
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,010
natural language.

119
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,260
It's hard enough to
understand speech.

120
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,040
Then we have to add
natural language.

121
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,400
And then the third hard problem
we have to solve is

122
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,730
semantic understanding, or
understanding structure enough

123
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,660
to say, when you say, what hotel
am I staying at, we mean

124
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,260
that there's a hotel, there's
a name to the hotel, and

125
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,450
there's an address, and
there's a phone

126
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,090
number and so on.

127
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,910
Very structured information.

128
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,440
These are hard problems, but
I'd much rather let Google

129
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,640
solve these hard problems
than me as a user.

130
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:36,430

131
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,640
Like I said, speech, natural
language, structured data

132
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,960
understanding.

133
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,710
Now, why is it an important
problem to solve?

134
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,030
If you think about it, during
the course of a typical day &mdash;

135
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,080
not a day that you're at Google
I/O, a typical day &mdash;

136
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,360
you have lots of questions,
and you want fast answers.

137
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,330
Imagine if each of these
questions took several steps,

138
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,510
you'd be spending a lot of time
just futzing around with

139
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,670
the data that you have.

140
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,220
And you see some of these
questions here.

141
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,070
Some of these questions are
coming from our Knowledge

142
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,090
Graph, and they can be answered
from the Knowledge

143
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,430
Graph that we're building.

144
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,840
And if you attended some of
the structured data talks

145
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,440
earlier today, you know we're
investing in building out this

146
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,200
Knowledge Graph, understanding
things, understanding

147
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,660
places, and so on.

148
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,850
500 million entities
and growing.

149
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,910
But then, not all answers
come from that, right?

150
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,920
So some of these answers
do come from your own

151
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,940
information, let's say your
emails or your calendar.

152
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,150
And we want to be able to help
you go from the question to

153
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,070
answer in one step for those
answers as well.

154
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,640

155
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,810
In some cases &mdash;

156
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,420
not all cases, but in some
cases, when the context is

157
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,850
right, in fact, we actually
shouldn't even have to wait

158
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,560
for you to ask that question.

159
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,310
You have a special order that
you're waiting for, or you

160
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,490
just ordered it and
that shipped.

161
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,930
You should just be able to say,
look, the package that

162
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,980
you're waiting for has shipped,
and this is Google

163
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,040
Now for those of you who
are trying it out.

164
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,450
Let me actually switch gears to
a demo so we can actually

165
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,400
show some of these in action.

166
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,435
I'm going to first dare the
Wi-Fi gods here and see if we

167
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:13,040
can pull it off, the Voice
Search on a phone.

168
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,930
So as I mentioned earlier, I
have this flight coming up

169
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,400
tomorrow morning, and I have a
lunch meeting with a client,

170
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,110
and I just don't want
to be late to it.

171
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,720
So I can say something like,
when is my restaurant

172
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,970
reservation?

173
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,880

174
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,490
COMPUTER VOICE: You have a
reservation for Agnelini

175
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,830
Osteria, 1200 hours
PM tomorrow.

176
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,020
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So I can
see that I see the restaurant

177
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,810
reservation right away.

178
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,370
I don't have to futz
with my phone.

179
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,880
The answer comes
up right away.

180
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,790
And then I say, OK, so it's at
12 o'clock, it's not too bad.

181
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,510
But then, wait.

182
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,620
When does my flight get there?

183
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,750
So I can ask something like,
when does my flight land?

184
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,900

185
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,240
COMPUTER VOICE: Virgin America
Flight 1930 from SFO to LAX

186
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,640
arrives at 9:03 AM tomorrow.

187
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,950
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: I
can hear the answer.

188
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,810
I can also see the answer
right away.

189
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,050
And then say, OK, look, unless
I'm paranoid, I have plenty of

190
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,770
time to get to the restaurant.

191
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,900
But I am paranoid, so I'm going
to wonder, is there

192
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,650
traffic between the airport
to the restaurant?

193
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,180
So I can now say something like,
how far is it from LAX

194
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,430
to Angelini Osteria?

195
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,660

196
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,220
COMPUTER VOICE: The drive from
Los Angeles International

197
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,500
Airport to Angelini Osteria
is 12.6 miles.

198
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,400
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So I
can see it's 12.6 miles.

199
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,200
It's 30 minutes, even
in peak LA traffic.

200
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,100
I still have plenty of time.

201
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,520
A couple of things I want to
highlight here in terms of

202
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,340
what's happening behind
the scenes.

203
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,270
The reason why, from this
question, I could just get to

204
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,180
the answers in one step is
that Google is able to

205
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,970
understand when I say "my
flight" or "my hotel," it's

206
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,040
able to understand based on
the context that, hey, you

207
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,100
have a flight coming up, you
have a hotel reservation, and

208
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,350
use that information
to get the answer.

209
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,340
The second thing worth noting
here is that each of these

210
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,410
responses that Google is
giving back is very

211
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:02,870
structured.

212
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,250
So when you have the restaurant
reservation, it's

213
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,300
actually telling you the most
important things that you'd

214
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,480
want to know, like what time it
is, where it is, and even

215
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,430
get directions to get there.

216
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,680
Let's try a couple
more things.

217
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,150

218
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,790
What's on my schedule
this weekend?

219
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,350

220
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,210
COMPUTER VOICE: You have a
ticket for "Iron Man Three" at

221
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,360
9:30 PM tomorrow.

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,870
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
All right.

223
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,610
So I can see that I have a movie
that my husband's taking

224
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,520
me tonight to make up for all
the long hours at work making

225
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,760
these demos work.

226
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,390
And I can also see again, to
reinforce the point, so when I

227
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,390
ask this question, what I want
to know are the most obvious

228
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,620
pieces of information that
I need as a user.

229
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,675
If I have a movie coming up, I
want to know the most obvious

230
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:51,470
things, which is what time it
is, where it is, and even

231
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,310
directions to get there, and
we're able to actually present

232
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,750
that structured information.

233
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,780
I can also see that there's
another event which is just my

234
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,240
usual regular yoga class
on Saturday.

235
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,720
It's coming from my
Calendar event.

236
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,590
I can also say, oh yeah, I
have this brunch with my

237
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,670
friends, again, like
where and when.

238
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,530
And I can say, oh yeah, there's
this event invitation

239
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,905
that I have for somebody's
birthday at my neighbor's.

240
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:19,470

241
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,960
This is a multiscreen
experience.

242
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,480
I just showed you on the phone,
I can speak these

243
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,710
questions and get an answer on
the phone, because usually

244
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,510
that's where you are
on the go, you want

245
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,870
the questions answered.

246
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,560
But I could just as well type
it in or even speak on the

247
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,330
laptop or desktop here.

248
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,750
In fact, why don't I actually
switch gears and show you a

249
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,840
couple examples just so you
know this is available

250
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,790
anywhere on Google.

251
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,120
So here I have my laptop.

252
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,070
I'm signed in.

253
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:56,740
I could say something like,
I could just type in.

254
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,420
And I see the same answer.

255
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,180
Because I typed in, I just see
the answer as a result.

256
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,500
Notice that I actually said a
slightly different thing.

257
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,080
I said, "when does my flight
leave," versus "when does my

258
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,840
flight land," and Google is
able to understand that.

259
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,770
I could also, again, speak
this on my laptop.

260
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,695
I could basically say, when
does my flight leave?

261
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:26,400

262
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,360
Let me try that again.

263
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,280
OK, Google.

264
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,530
When does my flight leave?

265
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,640

266
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,010
COMPUTER VOICE: Virgin America
flight 1930 from SFO to LAX

267
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,180
leaves at 8:00 AM tomorrow.

268
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,330
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: And
so you notice that I can

269
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,830
basically speak to Google on
the laptop or on the phone.

270
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,300
I could also type it in.

271
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,990
Let me show you another
example.

272
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:55,860
I can basically say something
like, "my reservations."

273
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,930
And so right away, you see I
have a hotel reservation

274
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,050
coming up, the very one that I
was talking about earlier.

275
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,170
And again, I see all the
information that I need to be

276
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,930
able to act on that
information.

277
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,620
I have the restaurant
reservation coming up.

278
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,990
And I can type this in, and
again, Google understands when

279
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,120
I say "my," what do I mean when
I say "my reservations"

280
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,440
or "my hotels" and so on.

281
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,690

282
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,130
Let's switch gears.

283
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:27,340

284
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,590
So if you're a developer,
around this time, you're

285
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,750
thinking maybe a
couple things.

286
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,700
One, as a user, how
can I get to play

287
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,310
with these new features?

288
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,770
These are opt-in experiences
that we are actually building,

289
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,690
and we're building features
on top of it.

290
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,440
So at the end of the talk, I'm
going to give you instructions

291
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,340
on how to get in on the field
trial as a user on the how do

292
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,940
I actually ask Google for
information about myself,

293
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,240
about my own world?

294
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,460
Those of you who haven't tried
Google Now, you can actually

295
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,210
go to the Play Store and
download it and see some of

296
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,910
these contextual cards show up
as well so that you don't even

297
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,340
have to search for these.

298
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,920
On the day of the stay, you
should just get the hotel

299
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,660
information.

300
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,520
But as a developer, you're
wondering the other thing,

301
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,620
which is, if this is the new
Google, how can I be part of

302
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,150
this experience, and where
do you fit in here?

303
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,380
And here's the question that's
the most obvious one, which

304
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,070
is, you have all these
unstructured pieces of

305
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,020
information, and we need to be
able to turn these into really

306
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,430
structured answers.

307
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,630
And how does that happen,
and how do

308
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,130
developers be part of it?

309
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,390
And this is where email
markups come in.

310
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,820
The idea is very simple.

311
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,510
So for each of these use cases &mdash;
let's say the flight

312
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,230
or the hotel or the events &mdash;

313
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,250
we're saying, OK look.

314
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,340
For the user, these are the five
or six or 10 pieces of

315
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,640
information that are
really important.

316
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,180
So let's define a schema, a
vocabulary, for each of these

317
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,320
use cases and say, OK, for a
flight, we should be able to

318
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,470
define these particular
fields.

319
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,660
And you as the developer can
simply mark up the emails that

320
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,570
you already send your users and
say, this particular piece

321
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,130
of information is a passenger
name, this particular thing is

322
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,515
a reservation number,
and so on.

323
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:13,160

324
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,780
For a flight, for example, as a
user, I might type in, "when

325
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,710
is my next flight," and I want
to see the most basic pieces

326
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,180
of information.

327
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,380
The most obvious thing I just
want to know is which airline

328
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,830
am I flying on and what
flight number it is.

329
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,470
Some of the other pieces of
information I might want is

330
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,450
what time it is departing so
I'm not late, where it is

331
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,180
departing from, which airport,
and the same thing on the

332
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,230
landing side.

333
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,410
What airport is it landing at,
and what time it's landing at.

334
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,790
So on the right hand side here &mdash;
so left hand side is

335
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,830
what the user sees, and on the
right hand side, what you see

336
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,700
here is a very simple data
model, a schema, that says,

337
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,360
look, these are the pieces of
information that you want your

338
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,700
users to see so you can define
and you can basically mark up

339
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,750
your email along these
pieces of the schema.

340
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,510
So you have reservation number,
you have the flight

341
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,620
number, you have the airline's
name, departure time, arrival

342
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,850
time, and so on.

343
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,110
Really simple.

344
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,450
But this is for a flights
use case.

345
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,610
For a different type
of use case, like

346
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,860
an event, for example.

347
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,520

348
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,780
It'll take some time to load.

349
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,480

350
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,040
So let's say you
have an event.

351
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,820
Again, the user comes
into Google.

352
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,730
They can say, when is
the Giants game?

353
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,690
And we know, for example, that
they have a Giants game coming

354
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,160
up, and we can show the
structured answer here.

355
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,520
And if you see that answer,
again, the most important

356
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,080
pieces of information, what time
it is and where it is.

357
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,850
That's it.

358
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,020
So the right hand side, you
again have the most basic

359
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,040
pieces of information that you
as a developer can simply mark

360
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,570
up against information
you send.

361
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,830
When does it start and what's
the name and where is it?

362
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,335
This is for an events
use case.

363
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:57,360

364
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,080
Another one would be a hotel,
which we'll go into detail

365
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,520
with Roy's hands-on demo here.

366
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,770
Loading.

367
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,190

368
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,930
So another one can be a
restaurant reservation where

369
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,730
again, the basic pieces
of information.

370
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,010
Again, we start with the user
experience and say, what are

371
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,760
the pieces of information you as
a user would want, and then

372
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,050
work backwards and say, what
should be the fields in the

373
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,460
schema that you as a developer
should add?

374
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,600
Now, these are just an initial
subset of use cases that we

375
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,570
started out with.

376
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,980
Because we said, OK, we want
to start helping users, and

377
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,130
the most obvious pain point
we saw was travel.

378
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,480
Instead of futzing around with
the phone, we really wanted to

379
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,970
say, OK, through Google Now and
through these answers, we

380
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,550
want to start helping
the users.

381
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,300
But this is not the
comprehensive set here.

382
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,570
And I think this is one thing
where your inputs, your

383
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,250
creativity, your ideas would
be really useful, and we're

384
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,930
hoping that we can actually set
aside some time today to

385
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,210
discuss those.

386
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,060
What would be your example
of a use case?

387
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,300
What are some things that you
share information, that you

388
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,810
send information to users and
you don't want it lost in the

389
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,890
mix, gathering dust
in the inbox?

390
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,930
And how can we pick those
examples &mdash; define the schema,

391
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,829
define the vocabulary
for those examples &mdash;

392
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,205
and then start building
new features?

393
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:16,800

394
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,700
So these are some really early
partners that we've actually

395
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,930
been working with in terms of
implementing markups, where

396
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,079
they're able to go from
unstructured information that

397
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,060
they send their users today to
these structured answers and

398
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,180
Google Now cards in
one single step.

399
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,070
Once they mark up these emails &mdash;
and we even have

400
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,010
tools that can help
with the markup &mdash;

401
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,870
and once they're able to do
the markup, they're done.

402
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,220
And what happens is the rest
of the hard work, they're

403
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,330
leaving to Google.

404
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,070
Bringing up this information
at the right time, doing

405
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,570
speech recognition, doing
natural language

406
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,900
understanding, the grunt
work there can be

407
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,460
dealt with by Google.

408
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,020
All you have to do as a
developer is basically take

409
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,450
the information you send already
and mark it up with

410
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,220
these basic pieces of
information, and you're done.

411
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,220
Now, I'm going to ask Roy to
actually walk you through a

412
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,930
couple of these examples, just
so you get a sense of how to

413
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,370
get started on these
as a developer.

414
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,040
Roy?

415
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,350
ROY LIVINE: Thanks, Aparna.

416
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,010
So let's say that you're an
online travel agency, and you

417
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,030
would like to get reservation
information available to users

418
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,830
through Google Now or through
answer in search.

419
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:30,110

420
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,230
So let's walk through the
process that booking.com, an

421
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,890
early adopter of our platform,
would have to go through if

422
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,440
they did this markup today.

423
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,390

424
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,770
So earlier this morning in the
Google Tools for Structured

425
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,420
Data, we introduced a really
new, cool tool called

426
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,910
Structured Data Markup Helper,
courtesy of these two

427
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,130
gentlemen in the first row.

428
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,830
So I will use this tool to
walk you through how

429
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,420
booking.com would mark
up their email.

430
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,610
So this is how the
tool looks like.

431
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,900
And as you can see, as Aparna
mentioned, we support four

432
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,590
different verticals, event
reservation, flight

433
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,510
reservation, lodging
reservation, and restaurant

434
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,490
reservation.

435
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,420
Since booking.com sends hotel
confirmation emails, I'm going

436
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,220
to click on the Lodging
Reservation.

437
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,710
So the input for this tool
is basically the

438
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,580
raw HTML of the email.

439
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,210
Now, I already prepared the
raw HTML of just a random,

440
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,990
regular booking.com hotel
reservation email.

441
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,620
I'll paste it in this box and
click on Start Tagging.

442
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,350

443
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:48,905
Take a few seconds to load,
more than a few seconds.

444
00:19:48,905 --> 00:20:03,570

445
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,145
Let's just open another page.

446
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:08,368

447
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:10,490
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Blame
it on the Wi-Fi.

448
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,200
ROY LIVINE: Yeah.

449
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,180
AUDIENCE: It's going, Roy.

450
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,060
ROY LIVINE: It's going?

451
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,660
There it is.

452
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,670
OK, let's do it quickly
once again.

453
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:27,830

454
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,080
There you go.

455
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:44,980

456
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,970
Don't go away, please.

457
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,220
Bear with me.

458
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,800

459
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,740
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Do
you want to hard-wire?

460
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,990
ROY LIVINE: Yeah, that should
be a good idea.

461
00:20:51,990 --> 00:21:14,690

462
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,810
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
There you go.

463
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,430
ROY LIVINE: OK.

464
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,030
So on the left hand side, you
can see what the users see

465
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,590
when they go to their
Gmail client.

466
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,840
It's just the email.

467
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,020
And on the right hand side, you
see the list of all the

468
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,350
fields that we support
for markup.

469
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,770
Now, our UI requires some of
the fields, and you can see

470
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,790
that the tool calls these out.

471
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,620
There are eight or nine
required fields here.

472
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,090
Let me quickly walk you through
the process of marking

473
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:44,010
up, and I'll show you
how easy it is.

474
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,480
We'll start with the
reservation number.

475
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,050
That's the first one.

476
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,510
I'll just click on the
reservation number, choose the

477
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,430
right field, and once I click,
you can see that the value is

478
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,600
updated on the right
hand side.

479
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,130
Let's quickly walk through
the rest of the fields.

480
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,560
Lodging name would be San
Francisco Marriott.

481
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,170

482
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,420
Street address.

483
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,655

484
00:22:09,655 --> 00:22:11,030
AUDIENCE: Can you [? zoom in ?]
a little bit?

485
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,260
ROY LIVINE: Yeah.

486
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,730
That's a good idea.

487
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,480
How is that?

488
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,730
OK.

489
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:29,260

490
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,955
The city would be
San Francisco.

491
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:34,660

492
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,180
State, California.

493
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:41,210

494
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:47,175
Country and postal code.

495
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:51,920

496
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,480
Under name, that would be me.

497
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,650

498
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,780
And last is check-in time.

499
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:05,700

500
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,410
That's it.

501
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,100
So I'll just want to review
these to make sure that I

502
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,680
didn't forget any of
the fields, and it

503
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,032
looks like I didn't.

504
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:17,010
I'll click on Create HTML, and
what you see here are the few

505
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,050
lines that you'll have to
add to the top of your

506
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,360
email, and that's it.

507
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,660
Basically, your markup
is done.

508
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,370
It's as simple as that.

509
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,730
I think it's a good time to
mention that we support two

510
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,040
kinds of formats.

511
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,590
The traditional HTML we have
been supporting since we

512
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,090
introduced rich snippets.

513
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,260
And also, we decided to support
another format, JSON

514
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,430
LD, which some people feel
that it's easier to

515
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,590
understand, easier to implement
and to read.

516
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,860
If you do want to use JSON LD,
that's the default here.

517
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,540
And if you want to use microdata
HTML, you just have

518
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,690
to choose it.

519
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,980
What you see here on the right
hand side is just the raw HTML

520
00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:01,960
with these few lines of HTML
markup added to the raw email.

521
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,580
There it is.

522
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,370
So just to recap, it's super
easy to implement this.

523
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,820
The tool that I just showed
you, the Markup Helper, is

524
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,280
already available in our
developer website.

525
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,030
And Iein's team also created
a validation tool.

526
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,860
Once you start to play with the
markup, you can copy the

527
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,130
markup that you created, paste
it into the Validation Tool

528
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,030
that's also in our developer
website, and see if you

529
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,250
actually marked up right.

530
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,650
And if you didn't, it'll tell
you what you did wrong so you

531
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,430
can fix it.

532
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,280
That's really easy.

533
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,910
Literally less than one day of
work for one engineer, and

534
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,240
this markup is done.

535
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,680
I hope you found it useful.

536
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,523
Thank you, and I'll hand
it over to Aparna.

537
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:49,958
[APPLAUSE]

538
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:57,290

539
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,120
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So this
is the link that Roy was

540
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,070
talking about.

541
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,510
I want to step back and recap
what you just saw because I

542
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,120
think it's a big shift for where
Search is going, and

543
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,320
it's worth thinking about what
this means for you as users as

544
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,500
well as developers.

545
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,290
As users, I think the way to
think about this is the future

546
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,410
of Search is actually going
from questions to

547
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,130
answers in one step.

548
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,260
Behind the scenes, there's a
lot going on, but the main

549
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,640
point is you shouldn't have to
worry about it as users.

550
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,960
Let Google do the hard
work, and you

551
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,870
should get your answers.

552
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,630
And these answers, and the
answers that we focused on in

553
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,950
this session, for sure are for
answers about your own world,

554
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,960
your own information, but
they're answers from the rest

555
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,800
of the world from the
Knowledge Graph

556
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,590
that figure in, too.

557
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,950
I think in the same way, as
developers, what we want to

558
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,300
try and do is, how can you
actually make sure that the

559
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,370
information that you're sending
these users today,

560
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,240
it's lying in their inboxes, how
can we make sure that we

561
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,710
bring up the relevant
information into the search

562
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,020
box and into Google Now,
again, in one step?

563
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,280
So you should leave the rest
of the hard work to Google.

564
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,492
Actually, if you can just do the
markup on the emails that

565
00:26:02,492 --> 00:26:06,670
you already send users, you're
basically good to go.

566
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,530
I'll leave you with two
concrete next steps.

567
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:13,510
One, as users, if you haven't
tried either Google Now or the

568
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:17,080
Search field trial, we have an
opt-in experience where once

569
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,940
you opt into this experience
at this short link here,

570
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,370
g.co/searchtrial, you will be
able to basically start

571
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,770
playing with this and
experimenting with features

572
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,740
that I just demoed.

573
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,640
You should be able to say,
when is my flight?

574
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,970
What's my schedule?

575
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,150
Show me emails from my friend.

576
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,370
So examples like that.

577
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,580
And then the second thing, as a
developer, one concrete next

578
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,420
step is we have actually an
entire developers' website

579
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,450
dedicated to going through all
of this in detail, all the

580
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,450
tools and the documentation
on the schema that we've

581
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,960
developed for these
initial use cases.

582
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,050
But also, we're actually
starting a small pilot program

583
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,710
to sign up partners.

584
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,210
Some of these partners are
on board, as you saw.

585
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,380
But definitely, sign up to be
part of the program and work

586
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,130
together with us so that you can
see how to start surfacing

587
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,310
in Google Now and search.

588
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,750
Thank you.

589
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,550
[APPLAUSE]

590
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,150
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So I think
we have maybe time for

591
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,450
Q&A if you want to raise
any questions.

592
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,820
Otherwise, we're also back
in the Sandbox area where

593
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,860
Knowledge is, and you can come
talk to us about any of these

594
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,595
questions in detail.

595
00:27:23,595 --> 00:27:25,900
And if there's anything you know
from this talk, we love

596
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,150
answering questions.

597
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,830

598
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,105
AUDIENCE: Hi.

599
00:27:31,105 --> 00:27:33,970
I wonder if you could comment on
the roadmap for new schemas

600
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:39,420
and whether there's a schedule
of coming schemas.

601
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:39,640
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Sorry.

602
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,880
Can you say that again?

603
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,820
AUDIENCE: I wonder if you could
comment on the roadmap

604
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,680
for schemas.

605
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,110
Right now, I saw I think
four examples.

606
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:51,010
I think yesterday we saw some
examples of media and music.

607
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,300
Is there a roadmap
for schemas?

608
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,900
Is there a schedule?

609
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,000
If you could comment on the
plans of the future.

610
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,090
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So the
question was yesterday in the

611
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,550
keynote, you saw some of these
other examples of your own

612
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:07,330
information being very easy,
like one of the specific demos

613
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,800
we saw was, show me
my pictures from

614
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,160
New York last year.

615
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,800
And instead of, again, futzing
through albums and albums,

616
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,555
we're just basically doing the
hard look and saying, look,

617
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:18,950
here you go.

618
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,840
And today, you saw these other
kinds of examples.

619
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,700
And the question was,
is there a roadmap?

620
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,370
What's the bigger
picture here?

621
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,990
The way we think about this
problem, again, is starting

622
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,660
with the user and saying, what
are the typical daily

623
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,790
information needs
that a user has?

624
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,260
Now it turns out, we actually
did a bunch of user studies

625
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,710
around this.

626
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,000
We found that some of
these user needs are

627
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,140
about the real world.

628
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,440
They say basically, how is the
traffic to this place, or

629
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,100
what's the GDP of
that country?

630
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,510
Is the restaurant open?

631
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,090
But many of these questions,
what we found from our user

632
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,660
studies, are about their
own information.

633
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,570
Especially as that information
keeps growing, their need to

634
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,810
find that information grows.

635
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,740
So some of this information
is photos, is media.

636
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,680
Other pieces of information are
in their emails, typically

637
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,890
events and other travel-related
questions.

638
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,920
There are other verticals
or use cases that we've

639
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,530
identified, and we're starting
to work on them.

640
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,340
And the reason we've actually
done a field trial of these is

641
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,230
to say, OK, let's put it in
front of our users for the use

642
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,740
cases that we can start
unlocking and see how the

643
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,260
reaction is.

644
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,610
How do people actually use
this, and how do people

645
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,670
actually find this information
useful?

646
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,950
So over the next few months and
until the end of the year,

647
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,680
we're going to start expanding
these use cases.

648
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,270

649
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:34,830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

650
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,060
So you've showed how we can
register information that's

651
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,440
later recalled from Google
Now or through the

652
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,870
Google search tools.

653
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,290
Are there other interfaces &mdash;

654
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,430
are there programmatic
interfaces &mdash; to allow

655
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,740
developers to be able to pull up
that information that maybe

656
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,020
was registered by other
applications?

657
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,270
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: That's
a good question.

658
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,900

659
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,500
So the question, as I
understand it is,

660
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,780
look, this is great.

661
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,810
One obvious surface is through
the search tools and Google

662
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,250
Now, but are there other APIs
for developers to actually

663
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,900
surface that information?

664
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,250
I think the way to think about
this is, again, componentizing

665
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,170
these pieces of information.

666
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:22,770
For example, once Chrome gets
the microphone icon, then

667
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,230
through the Chrome APIs, you
should basically be able to

668
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,830
say your own website
should get you the

669
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,080
capability to do voice.

670
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,220
And again, you should rely on
Google to do the hard work in

671
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,560
terms of actually having the
underlying technology, but

672
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,900
then you should just worry
about the responses that

673
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,120
you're going to generate
for the user.

674
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,870
So the way I think about the
problem is more, what's the

675
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,410
most obvious surface where the
users are actually looking for

676
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,520
this information?

677
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,460
Start there.

678
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,570
Help them there.

679
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,790
And then figure out if there
are other places

680
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,102
that we can help them.

681
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:58,780

682
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,860
AUDIENCE: So I was interested
in the Schema Helper.

683
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,880
You showed only four helpers
that were specifically tied to

684
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,310
events and reservations.

685
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,950
Are there any plans of
adding more such

686
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,340
helpers in the near future?

687
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:13,640
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Yes.

688
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,770
Do you have any ideas on what
kinds of other use cases?

689
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,262
AUDIENCE: For example,
products.

690
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:20,470
If you sell products, then you
could send the schema for a

691
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,110
product on the email.

692
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,320
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Yes.

693
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,320
So the question is in the Helper
tool, you saw we had a

694
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,490
few use cases &mdash;

695
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,710
events, hotels, flights,
restaurants.

696
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,540
The question was, well, why
don't we have helpers for

697
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,500
other use cases?

698
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
This is exactly the kind of back
and forth conversation

699
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,520
we'd love to have in the
developer community which is,

700
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,030
what are the other use cases?

701
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,800
Products would be a really
good one, where there's a

702
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,470
purchase order, for example.

703
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,380
AUDIENCE: So it will work
as a conversation?

704
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,700
We ask and you develop?

705
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,660
Or will we have APIs to build
our own helpers and maybe add

706
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,730
them to the tool?

707
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,150
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: In the
beginning &mdash; and Justin, feel

708
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,920
free to jump in here.

709
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,910
MALE SPEAKER: One comment.

710
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,375
I saw before for email-oriented
schemas

711
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,345
[INAUDIBLE]

712
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:07,086
conditional schemas that are
more [INAUDIBLE] oriented.

713
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:08,336
[INAUDIBLE].

714
00:32:08,336 --> 00:32:14,030

715
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,006
So we don't have current plans
to open up [INAUDIBLE]

716
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:17,998
schema process.

717
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:20,974
[INAUDIBLE]

718
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:24,450
it would be challenging,
but [INAUDIBLE].

719
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,700
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

720
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,710

721
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,410
AUDIENCE: Hi.

722
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,620
My name is Tim.

723
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,890
Question.

724
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,620
How does it define what
information is shown on the

725
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,350
main part of the search and
which one is shown on the

726
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,200
right side?

727
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,640
So for example, if I look for
flight information, it

728
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,860
currently displays in the main
search area, and some

729
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,760
information is shown
on the right.

730
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,560
And related to that is,
what if you have

731
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,230
multiple matching results?

732
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:58,760
So I have multiple flights in
different sites, or it could

733
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,870
be products or whatever.

734
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,140
How is that being handled?

735
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,720
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So two
parts to your question.

736
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,500
One is, when do we basically
figure out, how do we figure

737
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,740
out and what's the logic in
terms of when we bring up the

738
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,080
information front and
center versus when

739
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,360
we think it's auxiliary.

740
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,330
And what you are referring to is
in fact in the field trial.

741
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,510
For certain queries or certain
questions, we think there is a

742
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,300
very strong explicit intent.

743
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,350
For example, if you say, "When
does my flight land," I mean,

744
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,330
there's no question that you're

745
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,800
asking about the flight.

746
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,740
But if you said "Virgin America"
because you wanted to

747
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,040
basically look up the customer
service number, we don't want

748
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,660
to get in the way.

749
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,650
Again, this is Google,
this is search.

750
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,140
We definitely don't want to be
getting in the way between

751
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,500
your question and answer, and we
want to be doubly sure that

752
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,640
we understood the intent
of your question.

753
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,290
So if your question is, when is
my flight, then we'll say,

754
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,500
OK obviously, you're looking for
the flight, so let's give

755
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,190
you that answer and get
out of the way.

756
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,890
But if your question starts
with "Virgin America" or

757
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,570
"Virgin America Customer Service
Number," then we think

758
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,350
that if this information is
helpful, then we basically

759
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,670
give you in the auxiliary
in the right hand side.

760
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,240
But in general, we try to
actually get closer and closer

761
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,690
to your explicit intent
as much as possible.

762
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,875
And this is where the natural
language helps because when

763
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,540
you're expressing questions or
queries in natural language,

764
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,360
there's very little doubt
what you mean.

765
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,030
So for example, if you wanted
to know the customer service

766
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,449
number, if you're able to say
this to Google, you would.

767
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:26,270
If you're able to say to Google,
what's the customer

768
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,840
service number of Virgin
America, you would.

769
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,760
And that's hard.

770
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,340
It takes some early steps,
but the natural language

771
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,889
technology is not
fully there yet.

772
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:40,340
And the other thing you
mentioned was around, how do

773
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,429
we make sure that the
information is represented?

774
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:43,850
AUDIENCE: No.

775
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,679
I mean, I could have more
than one match.

776
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,600
So one example is the data about
contacts you're showing

777
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,630
on the right side now.

778
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,130
What if you have multiple
matches or multiple

779
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,110
applications that provide
the same information?

780
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,580
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Yeah,
and we love that use case

781
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,310
because it actually
shows off &mdash;

782
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,630
so in fact, in the demo if
you saw, I typed in "My

783
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,260
Reservations," and I had a hotel
reservation, I had a

784
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,055
restaurant reservation.

785
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:10,550
We showed both of those
because you said, "My

786
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,370
reservations." Or if you said my
flights, and you're a busy

787
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,420
bee, and you have five flights
coming up in the next month,

788
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,960
we basically want to give you
all the information you need.

789
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,600
And in fact, I can show you how
each of these pieces of

790
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,310
information, you can expand and
say &mdash; and I can certainly

791
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,270
show you the link later &mdash;

792
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,720
but expand the information in
place so that you could see

793
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,370
all the relevant information
about a flight and go on to

794
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,800
the next one and so on.

795
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,410
So the way we basically figure
out is based on the query that

796
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,110
you have &mdash; if you said "My
flight tomorrow," it'll give

797
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,260
you just that.

798
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,410
But if you said "My flights
next month," then we

799
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,090
understand that and say
here, all of it.

800
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,340
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

801
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,380

802
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:49,610
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

803
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,550
Just another quick one.

804
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,360
So you mentioned about multiple

805
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,350
events around something.

806
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:57,380
What about events that
change information?

807
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,300
My reservation changes,
things like that.

808
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,180
How do I, as a developer, go
back and update it so I'm not

809
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,540
having outdated information
shown to users?

810
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,550
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: That's a
really good point because I

811
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:14,920
think in all of these use cases,
reservations or events,

812
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,340
and that's precisely why
markup is helpful.

813
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,950
So once you actually give the
email and you're able to mark

814
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,910
up the updated email that you
send the users, we're able to

815
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,040
figure it out and say, OK, this
is obviously the latest

816
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,720
information here.

817
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,710
ROY LIVINE: So if you think
about it, our API is actually

818
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,470
the emails that you're
sending out.

819
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,560
If you want to update the
reservation, just send an

820
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,070
email, and we will do all
the heavy lifting.

821
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,280
We'll understand that this
is actually the previous

822
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,500
reservation if you provide the
confirmation number, and then

823
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,750
we will be able to update
the card in Search

824
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,090
and in Google Now.

825
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,640
So really, the emails
are your APIs.

826
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,460
AUDIENCE: So the assumption is
that that should be taken care

827
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,980
of as long as we have sent some
sort of a follow-up tied

828
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,780
to some kind of key?

829
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,200
ROY LIVINE: Exactly.

830
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,970
And you mark up.

831
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,140
You'll have to mark up so that
we can understand and dedupe.

832
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

833
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:06,610

834
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:10,940
AUDIENCE: So this is maybe a
different kind of use case.

835
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,300
At one point, Google, I think,
had a tool that would index

836
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,670
all the information on my
computer because you can't

837
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,570
remember all the stuff
that's in there.

838
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:25,000
And I don't know whether that
tool even still exists, but I

839
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,030
wind up keeping things in my
inbox as a reminder of things

840
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,600
I need to do.

841
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:35,570
Or I even send myself emails
just to remind me of something

842
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:40,400
to do or to keep track of a
small piece of information

843
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,380
that otherwise would be lost.

844
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:47,590
Because at least if it's in my
Gmail, I can search on it.

845
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:52,940
But for instance, I can't find
that out if I'm away from

846
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,650
home, and I just
have my phone.

847
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:59,660
But have you ever thought about
that aspect of this?

848
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,130
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So there
are two parts to what you're

849
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,460
asking, and the question or the
topic that you've brought

850
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,920
up is, my inbox has a
lot of information.

851
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,460
Some of it is very actionable
in terms of the information

852
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,430
that I need for a flight, but a
lot of it is just my backup

853
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,580
to my brain, just information
that I've sent there, and I

854
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,080
know it's safe, and I know
it's in the inbox.

855
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,590
It won't go away.

856
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,080
I could come back to it.

857
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,430
Are we doing anything
better there?

858
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,710
So there are two parts here.

859
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,340
One is if you have attended
the other talk we had

860
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,770
yesterday around actions and
inbox, so one of the things

861
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,940
we're trying to make is make
the inbox more alive.

862
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,880
So for example, don't
let the to do list

863
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,030
gather dust in the inbox.

864
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,980
Actually resurface it at
a time that's most

865
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,940
appropriate to you.

866
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,640
The second part of it is, in
fact, we just launched a new

867
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,470
version of Google Now yesterday
in the latest

868
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,300
release of the client,
and we have a

869
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,900
feature called Reminders.

870
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,120
And the idea is really simple.

871
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,540
You should be able to tell
Google, hey, remind me to call

872
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,395
mom when I get home, and have
that be surfaced as

873
00:39:01,395 --> 00:39:02,870
a Google Now card.

874
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,350
And down the line, we want to
be able to actually use

875
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,650
information, again, in your
inbox because you told us

876
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,930
that's important, and use that
to, again, resurface good,

877
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,355
actionable to do lists for
you in Google Now.

878
00:39:13,355 --> 00:39:16,025

879
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:18,440
AUDIENCE: It's sort
of an ordeal to

880
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,990
give myself that reminder.

881
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,660
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Right, exactly.

882
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,530
You shouldn't have to.

883
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,780
Yes, exactly.

884
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:32,060

885
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,940
Last question.

886
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,540
Make it good.

887
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,920
AUDIENCE: So I'm thinking
about attachments.

888
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,650
So a lot of us have attachments,
text documents,

889
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,010
that have information that we
want to look for, but the mail

890
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:45,130
would just have an attachment,
and there's no way &mdash;

891
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,110
I would need to figure out a
good keyword to look for that

892
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:53,090
mail, remember who that person
sent that mail to search for a

893
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,530
keyword that's in
the attachment.

894
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,610
So is there work?

895
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,430
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: We don't
have anything at this point,

896
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,730
but I think definitely, that's
one of the things we do see is

897
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,190
that a lot of the information is
actually in these auxiliary

898
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,780
parts of the email,
and we should be

899
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,890
able to actually surface.

900
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,560
And the way to think about this
is we just don't want the

901
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,490
work to be in your head and
make it easy for you to

902
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:19,075
actually pretty much give us a
few shorthands saying, OK, who

903
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:20,340
is this from?

904
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,440
What is this about?

905
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,590
And then we should
do the hard work.

906
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,800
AUDIENCE: Just show
some metadata.

907
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,890
That will make it easier for the
user to search for things.

908
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,820
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Nothing
yet, but definitely something

909
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,700
we're thinking about.

910
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,870
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

911
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,290
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: We're out
of time, but again, we're

912
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,210
in the Sandbox area.

913
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,770
Any questions, thoughts, ideas
around new use cases, come

914
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,070
talk to us.

915
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:38,670
Thanks.

916
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,920
[APPLAUSE]

917
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,785
