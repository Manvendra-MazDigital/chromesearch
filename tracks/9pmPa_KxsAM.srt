[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,687
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

3
00:00:06,687 --> 00:00:08,635
Senior Vice President,
Vic Gundotra.

4
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:15,470

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,520
VIC GUNDOTRA: Well, good
morning and hello.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,350
And on behalf of Google, let me
extend our warmest welcome

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,560
to the 6,000 of you here in
attendance as well as the over

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,520
40,000 who have joined us in 440
viewing parties across 90

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,920
countries worldwide.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,780
And to the over one million
who are watching live on

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:52,160
YouTube right now, welcome to
the sixth annual Google I/O.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,240
Our platform and services teams
have worked incredibly

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,880
hard to get to this point.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,630
And I hope you're going to be
delighted by some of the

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,630
surprises we have in store
for you this morning.

16
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,459
But as that opening
video showed, it's

17
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,220
really not about us.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,510
It's about you, developers,
who are building the most

19
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,540
amazing and magical experiences
that make those

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,330
platforms and services
come alive.

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:21,010
So when we say thank you, we
really sincerely mean it.

22
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,900
Your support, your enthusiasm,
your building of apps for our

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,290
platform and services has
been deeply appreciated.

24
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,460
And we hope that the things
that you'll see at this

25
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,160
conference will continue to
inspire you and that we at

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,630
Google will continue
to earn your trust.

27
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,150
So with that, let's get
this keynote started.

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,932
Please join me in welcoming
my friend Sundar Pichai.

29
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:58,580
[APPLAUSE]

30
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,710
SUNDAR PICHAI: Thank you, Vic.

31
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,270
It's incredibly exciting
to be here.

32
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,500
Welcome to Google I/O. I think
we are in the middle of one of

33
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,449
the most pivotal moments
in personal computing.

34
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,470
We are going through one of the
most innovative phases in

35
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,240
personal computing.

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,350
Most of you in this audience
have lived through the PC

37
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,690
revolution.

38
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,140
An incredibly important
revolution in our lifetime.

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,560
It started around 1980.

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,900
But if you take a look back, for
over 25 years most people

41
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,200
in the world used one operating

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,670
system, which was Windows.

43
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,090
And in terms of hardware form
factors, it evolved from

44
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,790
desktops to laptops over
a long period of time.

45
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,480
But fast forward to about
seven years ago.

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,030
With the advent of smartphone,
there's been an explosion of

47
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,780
devices, phones and tablets and
increasingly newer types

48
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,820
of devices.

49
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,780
People are adopting these
devices at an amazing pace

50
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,410
because it has a profound
impact on

51
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,380
their day to day lives.

52
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,670
Nothing captures this moment
as the picture behind me.

53
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,190
These are two pictures in
the same location in

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,240
Saint Peter's Basilica.

55
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,260
The one on the left is a the
funeral of Pope John Paul II.

56
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,030
The one on the right is the
announcement of the new Pope

57
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,536
Francis recently.

58
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,740
For sure, different moments,
the one on the

59
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,390
left this more somber.

60
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,560
But you can see there is one
person way ahead of their time

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,790
with a clam shell phone trying
to take a picture.

62
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,140
But you look at the one on the
right, a sea of phones

63
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,780
capturing that moment.

64
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,850
The world has changed pretty
dramatically just in a span of

65
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,120
six to seven years.

66
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,130
Increasingly people are using
many, many different types of

67
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,990
computing devices.

68
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,720
It's not just desktops, phones,
and laptops anymore.

69
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,860
It's watch with displays.

70
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,990
Its thermostats with displays.

71
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,070
Maybe a car console has a
display and maybe something

72
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,720
like Google Glass.

73
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,700
When you look at all these
computing devices, it's a

74
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,580
multi-screen world.

75
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,220
These are all small displays
with a lot of

76
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,830
computing power in them.

77
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,360
In addition to that,
they have sensors.

78
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,380
They can listen.

79
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,260
They can feel.

80
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,769
They can hear.

81
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,160
And the amount of computing
power in these screens is

82
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,860
incredible.

83
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,650
And users are really adopting
these computing devices.

84
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,600
We at Google are incredibly
excited.

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,140
This is why we view this as
one of the most important

86
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,570
moments in computing.

87
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,460
And we're working very,
very hard to continue

88
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,080
this journey forward.

89
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,140
The reason is at the heart of
this journey is the impact we

90
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,250
can have on people
around the world.

91
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,720
That's what this journey
of personal computing

92
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,740
is about for us.

93
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,150
We are very, very fortunate at
Google to have two platforms,

94
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,840
two large open platforms, two
fast growing platforms, two

95
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,850
scalable platforms completely
designed for developers like

96
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,190
you to build amazing

97
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,940
experiences, Android and Chrome.

98
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,780
Android started with a simple
goal of bringing open

99
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,440
standards to the mobile
industry.

100
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,390
Today it is the most popular
mobile operating

101
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,192
system in the world.

102
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:28,100
[APPLAUSE]

103
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,790
SUNDAR PICHAI: Chrome, again,
started as a simple journey to

104
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,310
make the web much better, both
as a platform for developers

105
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,320
and as an experience
for users.

106
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,150
The goal was to design
a simpler,

107
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,240
safer, and faster browser.

108
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,370
And today it is the
most popular

109
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,764
browser used in the world.

110
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:52,060
[APPLAUSE]

111
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,740
SUNDAR PICHAI: Android and
Chrome, as I said earlier, are

112
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,890
really designed for people
to build amazing

113
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,620
experiences on top.

114
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,050
We at Google are working hard
on top of these platforms.

115
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,920
We call this the
best of Google.

116
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,660
We are building products like
search, Maps, YouTube, Google

117
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,570
Now, and many more new things
which you will hear about

118
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,650
later today.

119
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,150
So we are working hard on top of
these platforms to push the

120
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,030
journey of computing forward.

121
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,730
But what really excites is that
developers like you can

122
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,870
build thousands of third party
applications, great

123
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,126
applications which really make a
difference on top of Android

124
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:28,000
and Chrome.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,460
And that's what a lot of
this keynote is about.

126
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,370
What are we doing on top of
these platforms so that you

127
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,240
can continue doing the
great work you do?

128
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,350
With that, let's get started.

129
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,730
We're going to talk
about Android.

130
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:47,230
So two years ago we announced
we had over 100 million

131
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,952
activations of Android.

132
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:51,920
We were incredibly excited at
the rate of the of growth.

133
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,660
And a year ago at Moscone we
celebrated the fact that we

134
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,180
have four 400 million
activations of Android.

135
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,000
The momentum has been
breathtaking since then.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,298
So let's take a look
at where we are.

137
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:08,286
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

138
00:07:08,286 --> 00:08:09,914

139
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:16,960
[APPLAUSE]

140
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,430
SUNDAR PICHAI: 900 million.

141
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,640
It's an extraordinary
achievement.

142
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,160
But it's an extraordinary
ecosystem achievement.

143
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,580
We couldn't have gotten there
without the help of a lot of

144
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,540
you in the audience and people
around the world, developers

145
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,800
around the world.

146
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,880
We are incredibly humbled by
where we have reached.

147
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,730
But we have to remember there
are over 7 billion people on

148
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,830
this planet.

149
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,490
So we have a long way to go.

150
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,669
And we think the journey is
just getting started.

151
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,360
So if you look, we're going
to put a map of the world.

152
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,820
And we're going to highlight
for you areas of the world

153
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,970
where the penetration of Android
is less than 10%.

154
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,790
And as you can see, while we're
growing very, very fast,

155
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,920
most of the world, the countries
in green here

156
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,610
represent over four and
a half billion people.

157
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,010
And the penetration of Android
is less than 10%.

158
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,610
But it is growing
very, very fast.

159
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,910
So a lot of this journey is
about bringing that next four

160
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,600
and a half billion people online
and making a difference

161
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,310
in their lives.

162
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,610
So we're going to talk a lot
about what we are doing in

163
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,260
Android both for developers
and users to

164
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,940
continue this momentum.

165
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,450
And to get started, I'm going to
invite Hugo onto the stage.

166
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:37,500
[APPLAUSE]

167
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,600
HUGO BARRA: Good morning,
everyone.

168
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,130
Thank you, Sundar.

169
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,140
How are you guys doing
this morning?

170
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,900
[CHEERING]

171
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,440
HUGO BARRA: Great.

172
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,400
You guys just heard about the
spectacular Android ecosystem

173
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,050
momentum all around the world.

174
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:57,220
Well it's also been an amazing
year for Android developers.

175
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,880
Here's a pretty insane
number for you.

176
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:06,450
Google Play has just crossed
48 billion app installs.

177
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:06,900
That's right.

178
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,570
48 billion app installs.

179
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,710
That's a huge number.

180
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,870
[APPLAUSE]

181
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,984
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

182
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:13,900
[APPLAUSE]

183
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,540
HUGO BARRA: And two and a half
billion installs in the last

184
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,320
month alone.

185
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,800
But even better than that, over
the last four months,

186
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,980
this year, we've already paid
out more money to Android

187
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,460
developer's on Google Play
than in all of last year.

188
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,920
And revenue per user &mdash;

189
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,713
thank you.

190
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:37,030
[APPLAUSE]

191
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,730
HUGO BARRA: And revenue per
user, which is a pretty

192
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,100
important stat for all of us, is
two and half times what it

193
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,510
was just a year ago globally.

194
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,250
So you guys, Android developers,
are really the

195
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,350
heart of this ecosystem.

196
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,920
And I think that
you know that.

197
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,990
We've been in this incredible
journey together for over five

198
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,270
years now since the first
Android SDK came out.

199
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,230
And as Vic said, Google
I/O is all about you.

200
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,170
And we're here to show
that we're listening.

201
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,880
And we're here because we really
want you to thrive.

202
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,530
So let's go.

203
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,710
Let's get started here.

204
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,550
The first thing we want to do is
give you a preview of some

205
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,750
exciting developer tools and
services that we're announcing

206
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,570
here at I/O. And, of course,
you'll get to see these in

207
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,440
great detail in the 52 Android
sessions and code labs that

208
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,070
we've put together just for you
over the next three days.

209
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,100
All right, so first off is
Google Play services.

210
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,190
A few months ago we launched
Google Play services as a

211
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,090
layer built and managed
by Google on top

212
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,480
on the Android platform.

213
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,310
It includes API that we at
Google use to build our own

214
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,430
apps like Google Maps
and Google Now.

215
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,940
And we're making these APIs
available to you so that you

216
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,720
can make your apps
even better.

217
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,860
Google Play services
are distributed

218
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,170
via the Play Store.

219
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,410
And it's automatically updated
directly by Google

220
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,300
independently of operating
system versions.

221
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,800
This means you have access to
the latest APIs consistently

222
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,260
on all devices.

223
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,200
[APPLAUSE]

224
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,360
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

225
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,500
Now, one of the first API's that
we launched as part of

226
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,530
Google Play services was the
Google Maps Android API v2.

227
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,680
Many of you already use
it in your apps.

228
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,890
You're looking here at
the Expedia app.

229
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,670
And you can see this is a major
user experience upgrade

230
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,230
compared to the original Android
platform Maps API.

231
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,910
It allows you to build Google
Maps directly into your app,

232
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,960
amazing vector based maps, full
3D movement and rotation,

233
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,790
and 3D building profiles.

234
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,310
Looks really, really great.

235
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,500
Now, location is a key input
to so many apps.

236
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,800
The Google Maps API is, of
course, a huge part of this.

237
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,490
But today we're going to take
it one step further by

238
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,750
launching three new
location APIs as

239
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,870
part of Google services.

240
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,650
A first API is called Fused
Location Provider.

241
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,590
We've completely rewritten our
locations algorithms, taking

242
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:18,340
advantage of all the sensors so
that location is now faster

243
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,400
to acquire.

244
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,910
It's more accurate.

245
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,790
And we're also adding a new low
power location mode that

246
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,020
uses less than 1% of
battery per hour.

247
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:35,740
[APPLAUSE]

248
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,310
HUGO BARRA: The second new
location API that we're

249
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,360
announcing today
is Geofencing.

250
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,560
Geofencing lets you define
virtual fences around

251
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,110
geographic areas.

252
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,870
And those trigger when
the user enters

253
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,690
or exits these areas.

254
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,200
You can have up to 100 geofences
simultaneously

255
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,850
active per app.

256
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,680
This has been a big
ask from you guys.

257
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,090
There you go.

258
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,320
That's what I thought.

259
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,494
[APPLAUSE]

260
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:03,720
HUGO BARRA: So I thought
you would like that.

261
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,250
The third new location API that
we're announcing today is

262
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,640
Activity Recognition.

263
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,170
There's been a lot of interest
from the developer community

264
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,330
for apps that help users track
their physical activities.

265
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,990
This new API, Activity
Recognition, uses

266
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,960
accelerometer data and machine
learning classifiers to

267
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,670
automatically figure out when
the user is walking, cycling,

268
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,710
or driving.

269
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,110
And we do it in a really battery
efficient way without

270
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,140
even turning on the GPS.

271
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,390
So we think there's going to
be a whole new category of

272
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,390
awesome apps that take
advantage of this new

273
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,640
capability.

274
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,330

275
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,670
So let's keep going.

276
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,310
Another Google Play services API
that we launched a couple

277
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,260
months ago was Google+
Sign-in.

278
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,940
And as many of you know, that
lets people sign into your app

279
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,620
with their existing Google
credentials so that you don't

280
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,120
have to create a new account
name space and users don't

281
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,280
have to remember yet
another passport.

282
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,420
Today we're expanding that
capability by introducing

283
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,200
cross platform single sign-on.

284
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,840
It's really exciting.

285
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,090
And I want to show you
that right now.

286
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,790

287
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,280
So Jai is here in The
Fancy Web site.

288
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,030
He's on his computer.

289
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,130
He has not created
a Fancy account.

290
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,040
But he is signed into Google.

291
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,700
And when he tries to fancy,
let's say, this margarita

292
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,980
maker, he's prompted to
create an account.

293
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,760
He's going to choose Google+
as his Sign-in method here.

294
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,540
Now here's the interesting
part.

295
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,650
He's getting an option to
automatically install the

296
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,910
fancy app on his
Android tablet.

297
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,940
That's pretty cool because now
he doesn't have to remember to

298
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,810
go find it and install
it later.

299
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,150
It just does it all for him.

300
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,950
So he's fancied his mixed
drink machine here.

301
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,660
Now let's switch over to his
tablet and take a look.

302
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,160

303
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,870
Now, Jai should have gotten
the notification &mdash;

304
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,680
there it is &mdash;

305
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,880
that says the app was
automatically

306
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,030
installed on his tablet.

307
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,630
This actually just happened.

308
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,400
And we &mdash;

309
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,600
thank you.

310
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,400
[APPLAUSE]

311
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,390
HUGO BARRA: And when he opens
the app here, because he's

312
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,240
already signed in on The Fancy
Web site, he's automatically

313
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,180
logged into the Fancy on
his Android tablet.

314
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,416
Isn't that cool?

315
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,730
[APPLAUSE]

316
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,660
HUGO BARRA: So he goes to the
My Collection section, which

317
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,340
shows things that he's fancied
before, there it is.

318
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,940
That's your margarita
machine, Jai.

319
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,630
That's pretty cool.

320
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,068
So that's cross-platform single
sign-on in action.

321
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:44,420
[APPLAUSE]

322
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,550
HUGO BARRA: So let's keep going

323
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,930
with Google Play services.

324
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,940
Last year at I/O we announced
Google Cloud

325
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,950
Messaging, or GCM for short.

326
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,840
GCM is a service that's managed
by Google that lets

327
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,990
you seamlessly push data
from your servers to

328
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,480
your Android apps.

329
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,560
GCM was super well
received by the

330
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,160
entire developer community.

331
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,460
60% of the top 100 apps
in Play Store

332
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,470
today are using GCM.

333
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:16,069
We're delivering 200,000 GCM
push messages every second.

334
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,504
That's 17 billion
messages a day.

335
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,829
[APPLAUSE]

336
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,000
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

337
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,349
And what's even more impressive
is the average

338
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,180
server to server latency.

339
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,200
That's 60 milliseconds, which
is actually 30% faster than

340
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,520
when we launched this service
just a year ago.

341
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,020
So the news here today is
that GCM is now part

342
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,900
of Google Play services.

343
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,850
And we're announcing three major
new features as part of

344
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,150
a major upgrade.

345
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,360
So, first, GCM now supports
persistent connections between

346
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,420
your servers and Google.

347
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,210
With a persistent connection you
can send a large number of

348
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,434
messages to many, many
devices very quickly.

349
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:58,390
Thank you.

350
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,780
[APPLAUSE]

351
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,410
HUGO BARRA: Second, we're
launching one of the GCM

352
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,660
features that you have
requested the most.

353
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,540
And I think you'll like this.

354
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,200
Upstream messaging,
there you go.

355
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,590
You can now use GCM to send data
in the other direction as

356
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,780
well, so from your app to your
servers just as seamlessly.

357
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,630
GCM, of course, does all the
client side connection

358
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,650
[INAUDIBLE] before you.

359
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,770
It automatically retries
if the network

360
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,660
isn't up and so on.

361
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,010
So it really helps to keep
battery and data usage as

362
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,550
minimal as possible.

363
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,010
Third, and I'm sure you'll
love this one too, we're

364
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,650
launching another GCM API that
synchronizes notifications for

365
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,110
you so that when you dismiss a
notification on one device &mdash;

366
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,050
there you go.

367
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:51,580
[APPLAUSE]

368
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,910
HUGO BARRA: So that same
notification goes away on the

369
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,150
other device as well.

370
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,910
And you'll see more about
this here today.

371
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,020
All of the three new major GCM
features you saw are rolling

372
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,340
out progressively.

373
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,160
And all you have to
do is sign up.

374
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,150
And you can do that
starting today.

375
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,790
So to summarize, this is
where we are right now.

376
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,580
These are the Google Play
services we've covered

377
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:18,710
already, the Maps API, the new
location APIs, Google+ sign-in

378
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,010
with cross-platform single
sign-on, and GCM with upstream

379
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,100
messaging and synchronized
notifications.

380
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,350
Now we're going to cover one
more service, a major one that

381
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,880
we're adding today.

382
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,470
So let's talk about gaming.

383
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,500
Everybody loves gaming.

384
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,660
And with the explosion of
tablets all around the world,

385
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,180
games are doing better
than ever.

386
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,740
And today we're announcing a
new family of APIs built

387
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,750
specifically for game
developers.

388
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,650
We call it Google Play
game services.

389
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,860
So let's talk about that.

390
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:59,150
The first new Google Play game
services API is Cloud Save.

391
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,380
Cloud Save enables you to save
user data across devices like

392
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,930
player progression
and game state.

393
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,520
So if a player finishes playing
level one on his

394
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,430
phone, for example, he can then
pick up is Android tablet

395
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,800
and start playing right
away from level two.

396
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,740
Thank you.

397
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,100
[APPLAUSE]

398
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,880
HUGO BARRA: Next, are APIs for

399
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,030
achievements and leader boards.

400
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,500
Achievements are virtual trophy
walls that make it

401
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,565
really easy for you to increase
engagement inside

402
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:30,840
your games.

403
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,330
And leader boards use Google+
Circles to connect players and

404
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,790
really encourage friendly
competition.

405
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,140
Let's put it that way.

406
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,990
So here we are in the game
called the World of Goo.

407
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,000
And from within the game my
friend Jai can launch into a

408
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,250
leader board and see how he
ranks against other players.

409
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,080
So here in the public leader
boards you can see that he's

410
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,570
actually not very
highly ranked.

411
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,460
You can't even find him.

412
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,680
That's the public
leader board.

413
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,180
But that's OK because he's
number two amongst his friends

414
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,270
on Google+, which looks pretty
cool until, of course, you see

415
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,520
who's number one.

416
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,422

417
00:21:07,422 --> 00:21:12,820
Now, Cloud Save, achievements,
and leader boards are APIs

418
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,860
that we're launching not only
on Android, but also for iOS

419
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,870
and web so you can have cross
platform gaming experiences,

420
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,207
which I think is pretty
important.

421
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:28,670
[APPLAUSE]

422
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,940
HUGO BARRA: Now here's where
it gets really exciting.

423
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,260
The next Google Play game
services API that we're

424
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,000
announcing today is a
comprehensive multiplayer

425
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,610
service for matching players and
engaging them in head to

426
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,740
head competition.

427
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,250
We know, obviously, because you
tell us, that building low

428
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,250
latency, real time synchronous
games is pretty damn hard.

429
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,800
So we want to help.

430
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,900
So the first thing we'll do is
we're going to deal with all

431
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,290
the hard networking problems and
manage all of the device

432
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,470
peer-to-peer connections
for you.

433
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,910
And then the second thing we'll
do via Google+ is make

434
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,110
it easier for your players to
invite friends that they want

435
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,580
to play with or against, as
well as quickly find new

436
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,400
people that they
can challenge.

437
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,490
What you'll see here are some
of the developers that we've

438
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,560
been working on to integrate
Google Play games services

439
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,720
into their titles.

440
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,060
There's actually lots of games
launching today with many of

441
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,000
these capabilities that
we talked about.

442
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,010
Now, these game APIs that we
just talked about are also

443
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,390
part of Google Play services,
by the way.

444
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,100
And all the core APIs that you
see here, some of the things

445
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,880
that we talked about today,
will be available via an

446
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,460
update to Google Play services
that we're rolling out today

447
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,510
to all Android devices,
Froyo and up.

448
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,240
And we'll continue to add the
best of Google innovation so

449
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,420
that you can continue to
build awesome apps.

450
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,110
Now &mdash;

451
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,690
thank you.

452
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,910
[APPLAUSE]

453
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,530
HUGO BARRA: I want to
shift gears and talk

454
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,540
about developer tools.

455
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,610
One of the most common pieces
of feedback that we get from

456
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,480
you all the time is that you
want more options for Android

457
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,260
development.

458
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,350
Well, today we want to show you
a new Android tool that

459
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,590
we've been working on.

460
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,860
It's called Android Studio and
it's based on the community

461
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,786
edition of IntelliJ
from JetBrains &mdash;

462
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:21,360
[APPLAUSE]

463
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,140
HUGO BARRA: --which,
obviously, you

464
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,390
guys know very well.

465
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,550

466
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,000
Android Studio is an IDE that's
truly built for Android

467
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,090
with the goal of making you
faster and much more

468
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,790
productive as an
app developer.

469
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,810
Now, I'd like to show
you this live.

470
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,970
And to do that, here's Tor
Norbye from the Android Tools

471
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,820
team for a quick demo.

472
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,295
Take it away.

473
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,640
TOR NORBYE: Good Morning.

474
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,440
Today, I want to share with
you a few of my favorite

475
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,890
features in Android Studio.

476
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,880
As Hugo said, Android studio is
based on IntelliJ, so it's

477
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,690
a fully featured IDE right
from the get-go.

478
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,990
What I love about it is the
attention to detail, which

479
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,980
makes it a pleasure to use.

480
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,060
The IDE has a deep semantic
model of your code and it

481
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,180
understands Android.

482
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,990
So that makes the Code Editor
smarter and more productive.

483
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,720
Take, for example, this
code right here.

484
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,380
This is how your write

485
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,040
internationalised apps in Android.

486
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,460
You don't hard code
your strings.

487
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,690
You look them up from
resource files.

488
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,120
Well, this IDE can figure out
what the real strings are and

489
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,990
show them to you in place in the
editor as if you had hard

490
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,820
coded the string.

491
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,570
[APPLAUSE]

492
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,630
TOR NORBYE: So note that the
code is still there.

493
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,380
It's just easier to read.

494
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,420
And we don't just
preview strings.

495
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,940
On the next few lines
you can see that I'm

496
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,470
manipulating some icons.

497
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,540
And those icons are previewed
right here

498
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,247
in the editor margin.

499
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:41,630
[APPLAUSE]

500
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,230
TOR NORBYE: And so, likewise,
here's a color file.

501
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,300
And you can see that we resolve
the colors and preview

502
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,630
those in editor margin
as well.

503
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,530

504
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,790
Now, when you're editing your
layouts, you now get a live

505
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,740
rendering of what the layout
is going to look like at

506
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,590
runtime time.

507
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,590
And what makes this really
powerful is that we have

508
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,490
multi-configuration editing.

509
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,060
So what if I want to know what
this layout looks like on

510
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,090
different screen sizes?

511
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,340
Let's take a look.

512
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,910

513
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,874
So here it is.

514
00:25:11,874 --> 00:25:18,210
[APPLAUSE]

515
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,250
TOR NORBYE: So here, I can see
my current layout rendered on

516
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,770
a 3.7 inch phone, 10
inch tablet, and

517
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,030
everything in between.

518
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,260
It's also showing me that I have
a custom tablet layout to

519
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,470
take advantage of that
extra space.

520
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,140
This feature is also great
for internationalization.

521
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,820
So if we jump into the settings
layout for our app, I

522
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,220
can now take a look at the
languages we're targeting.

523
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,600
And so, here, I can see my
layouts with the different

524
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,860
message catalogs applied.

525
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,440
So I can see Norwegian
in the bottom

526
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,916
left corner, for example.

527
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:50,250
[APPLAUSE]

528
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,390
TOR NORBYE: So let's say
I want to make an edit.

529
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,560
Let's say I want to bump up the
font size on this second

530
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,920
label here.

531
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,215
I can do that.

532
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:58,300
And that's obviously too big.

533
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,170
So let me go back a little
and make it 26.

534
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,730
So now this looks
OK in English.

535
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,030
But notice that in German right
next to it right over

536
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:09,010
here, this string is actually
wrapping, which I don't want.

537
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,870
So at this point I could either
continue tweaking my

538
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,180
layout or get a shorter

539
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,310
translation if that's possible.

540
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,400
So, in short, this is a feature
that makes it really

541
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,590
easy to ensure that your layouts
work well across a

542
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,540
variety of devices and
configurations.

543
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,070
And while I focused on the Code
Editor today, this also

544
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,920
works in the full UI builder.

545
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,320
We have big plans for
Android Studio.

546
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,530
We plan to integrate more and
more services into the IDE.

547
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,880
For example, with the simple
menu item, I can add a Google

548
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,310
Cloud Messaging back
end into my app.

549
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,450
And then I can take advantage
of all those great GCM APIs

550
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,700
that Hugo told you
about earlier.

551
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,670

552
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,720
And this is just scratching
the surface of all the new

553
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,340
features in Android Studio.

554
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,714
Thank you.

555
00:26:50,714 --> 00:26:56,920
[APPLAUSE]

556
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,272
HUGO BARRA: All right.

557
00:26:59,272 --> 00:27:01,370
I think I actually lost
my prompter, guys.

558
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,040
I need somebody to advance
that mainly for me, if we

559
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,290
could do that.

560
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,680

561
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,650
The prompter, please?

562
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,730
OK, well, then we
can ad lib it.

563
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,570
And so, of course, half of the
game is about building awesome

564
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,810
apps, developer tools, and
services, and so on.

565
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:25,180
The other half is about
distribution and monetization.

566
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,630
How do you find more users?

567
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,340
How do you monetize your app?

568
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,130
To tell you about a bunch of
new features to the Android

569
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,410
developer console, I'd like to
invite on stage Ellie Powers

570
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,970
from the Android product team.

571
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,220
Ellie, come on up.

572
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:51,670

573
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,610
ELLIE POWERS: All right.

574
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,050
Hi, everybody.

575
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,210
I'm Ellie and this is Miles.

576
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,830
So last year at Google I/O we
announced the new Google Play

577
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,570
developer console.

578
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,850
And since then you've sent us
tons of feedback telling us

579
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,240
exactly what you want
to see next.

580
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,300
We've taken that feedback into
account and today I'm here to

581
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,830
tell you about five new features
that we're adding to

582
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,430
the developer console to help
you get more users and make

583
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,520
more money on Android.

584
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,210
So let's get started.

585
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,900
The first feature I want
to tell you about is

586
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,980
optimization tips.

587
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,470
So let's take a look here.

588
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,170
We can see all of my apps in
the developer console.

589
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,920
And let's take a look at Fortune
Teller, which is my

590
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,020
most popular app.

591
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,430
OK, here we go.

592
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,750
This app is doing pretty well.

593
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,020
But I'm always wondering what
can I do to make Fortune

594
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,280
Teller a bit more successful?

595
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,230
And that's exactly what
we had in mind with

596
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,800
optimization tips.

597
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,560
It analyzes your app.

598
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,090
We look at how your app is
doing in the Play Store.

599
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,100
And we offer you insights about
how you can improve it.

600
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
So what do we have today?

601
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,650
We have two optimization tips.

602
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,220
The first one is telling us that
we should design our app

603
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,170
for tablets by uploading
tablet screenshots.

604
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,890
Now, this is really important,
and I should definitely do it

605
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,600
because it will encourage
more users on tablets

606
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,800
to install my app.

607
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,790
Next, it's telling me that I
have a lot of users who speak

608
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,320
Russian, and they're already
using my app.

609
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,100
But my app isn't actually
translated into Russian.

610
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,180
So that's another opportunity
for me.

611
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,870
OK, I don't speak Russian, so
I need to get some help.

612
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,590
It used to be a lot
of work to find a

613
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,730
translator for your apps.

614
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,800
You had to search the internet
looking for a good company.

615
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,890
But we want to make
this easier.

616
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,030
So that's why today we're now
going to use our new app

617
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,380
translation service,
fantastic.

618
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,640
[APPLAUSE]

619
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,790
ELLIE POWERS: And we're
announcing this today.

620
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,910
This service allows you to get
professional translations

621
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,790
directly in the developer
console.

622
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,850
And we're going to try it out.

623
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,090
OK, it takes just a minute to
upload the strings we want

624
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,830
translated into the Google Play
developer console here.

625
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,070
Next, we select the languages
that we want

626
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,950
to translate into.

627
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,860
So for today, we're, of course,
going to select

628
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,510
Russian and try to help
those guys out.

629
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,010
Next, it's going to show us a
list of all the different

630
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,520
translation vendors.

631
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,220
And then I can just pick one
that suits my budget.

632
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,990
And that's it.

633
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,880
Google will send my
strings off to

634
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,540
the translation company.

635
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,250
And then in about a week they
come back and I can download

636
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,720
them directly from the
developer console.

637
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,105
Super simple.

638
00:30:25,105 --> 00:30:32,240
[APPLAUSE]

639
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,190
ELLIE POWERS: Some of you may be
interested in participating

640
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,410
in this pilot program.

641
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,340
So please sign up in the
developer console today.

642
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,300
OK, now I've gotten Fortune
Teller ready

643
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,280
for the Russian market.

644
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,610
So I want to invest in a
campaign to promote my app.

645
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,970
But naturally I want
to know which ads

646
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,680
are the most effective.

647
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,060
And that's why we're announcing
referral tracking.

648
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,530
This makes it easy to
understand which

649
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,710
ads are most effective.

650
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,730
And we're going to switch to
Google Analytics to take a

651
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,130
look at it.

652
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,460
OK, here we're adding
a new report in

653
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,210
the acquisition section.

654
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,010
This is a conversion
funnel report with

655
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,590
data from Google Play.

656
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,380
It shows us where our installs
come from, like blogs or top

657
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,680
websites and other
important ads.

658
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,430
So here we go.

659
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,580
This will allow us to track
the effectiveness of each

660
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,350
referral channel.

661
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,220
So in the left we have each of
the channels followed by how

662
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,880
many users view, install,
and launch our app.

663
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,920
OK, installations with
an app are really

664
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,850
just the first step.

665
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,730
What you want is for users
to come back to your

666
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,240
app again and again.

667
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,020
And I want to understand how
often people are using my app.

668
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,870
I can do that with
Google Analytics.

669
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,680
But I have to go to
Google Analytics.

670
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,090
So soon we're going to be
showing these great engagement

671
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,380
metrics from Google Analytics
directly in

672
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,700
the developer console.

673
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,220
You'll have all your metrics &mdash;

674
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,208
thank you.

675
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:55,080
[APPLAUSE]

676
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,820
ELLIE POWERS: We want to give
you all your metrics together

677
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,570
in the same place.

678
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,240
These two analytics features
are rolling

679
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,180
out later this summer.

680
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,740
So now we have an app
that people are

681
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,060
launching all the time.

682
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,530
So, of course, it's time
to make money.

683
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,420
Like you, I just want to have
simple tools to show me how

684
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,000
much money I'm making
every single day.

685
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,320
So now we've added a new tab
to the developer console

686
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,590
giving us a summary of
our app's revenue.

687
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,420
You can see your global
revenue and how

688
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,150
it varies over time.

689
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,420
And then we can even show
country specific revenue.

690
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,455
For example, we can check how
our app's doing in Japan.

691
00:32:27,455 --> 00:32:29,840
Wow, it looks like we had
a great day last week.

692
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,610
It must have been our
new in app products.

693
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,710
Fantastic.

694
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,490
So that's it.

695
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,380
Revenue is at your fingertips
just like the

696
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,000
rest of your metrics.

697
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,020
OK.

698
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,955
Thank you.

699
00:32:39,955 --> 00:32:42,630
[APPLAUSE].

700
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,920
ELLIE POWERS: All right, so
we have a successful app.

701
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,490
We're making lots of money.

702
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,740
So now I'm ready to try some
new features with my app.

703
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,790
Now it's important.

704
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,860
I really want to find out what
do my core users think about

705
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,980
these new features before I roll
them out to everybody?

706
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,910
And from your feedback,
I think a lot of you

707
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,470
want to do this too.

708
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,166
So today we are launching
beta testing.

709
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:11,490
[APPLAUSE]

710
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,610
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah, a lot of
you talk to me on Google+

711
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,310
about this one and also
staged roll outs.

712
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,040
Let's take a look.

713
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,700
OK, we now have three tabs in
the developer console, alpha

714
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,670
testing, beta testing,
and production.

715
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,850
We want to start with a small &mdash;

716
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,470
[APPLAUSE]

717
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,720
ELLIE POWERS: All right,
thank you.

718
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,030
We'll start with a small group
of alpha testers and then roll

719
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,430
out to a larger group
of beta testers.

720
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,760
Let's set it up.

721
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,250
OK, we select the APK
for our test.

722
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,610
Next, we're going to use Google
Groups and Google+

723
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,370
Communities to control
access to the app.

724
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,000
Keep in mind here feedback will
be sent directly to me.

725
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,480
And it's not posted
as public reviews.

726
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,520
That's very important.

727
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,890
OK, so now we have
our new version.

728
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,940
We're ready to put it
into production.

729
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,740
But rather than upgrading all my
users in one go, I can now

730
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,370
manage the roll out.

731
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,070
So we can select a percentage
here, like, let's say, 10%.

732
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,560
and then we'd increase it over
time when we're ready.

733
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,953
OK.

734
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:10,900
[APPLAUSE]

735
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,719
ELLIE POWERS: Don't applaud
at the same time.

736
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,510
Let's start with 10%
on this side.

737
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,800
OK, so that was our five
new features in

738
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,790
the developer console.

739
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,110
We had optimization tips, the
app translation service, usage

740
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:26,130
metrics with referral tracking,
revenue graphs, and

741
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,697
beta testing with staged
roll outs.

742
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:35,389
[APPLAUSE]

743
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:36,639
ELLIE POWERS: All right,
thank you.

744
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,969

745
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,310
HUGO BARRA: Thanks, Ellie.

746
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,449
So just checking, how's
everyone doing?

747
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,250
How are you guys feeling?

748
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,115
Pretty good?

749
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,600
[APPLAUSE]

750
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,170
HUGO BARRA: OK.

751
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:49,560
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'm feeling pretty API'd

752
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,460
out at the moment.

753
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,420
So I guess it's probably a
good time to move on to

754
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:58,230
something maybe a little
bit more playful.

755
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,260
With that, I want to introduce
a man whose name is always

756
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,210
music to my ears.

757
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,690
Ladies and gentlemen,
our resident

758
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,722
rock star, Chris Yerga.

759
00:35:07,722 --> 00:35:17,480
[APPLAUSE]

760
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,180
CHRIS YERGA: Thank you, Hugo.

761
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,770
Good morning, everyone.

762
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,670
[JAPANESE], Tokyo.

763
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,220
Thanks for staying up.

764
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,390
All right, so we've just heard
about some great APIs and

765
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,680
tools to help you build the
next wave of Android apps.

766
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,760
But we've also been hard at work
helping users discover

767
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,460
all your great existing apps.

768
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,980

769
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,380
As we heard, we've been
successful that way with over

770
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,410
48 billion applications
installed from Google Play.

771
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,170
But our aspirations are
greater than that.

772
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,730
So I'm happy to talk to you
today about some improvements

773
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,340
we're making to Google Play.

774
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,660
We recently launched a
redesigned version of the

775
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,810
Google Play store.

776
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,020
It has a simple clean design
that's designed to scale

777
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,990
effortlessly across phones
and tablets and the web.

778
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:06,800
Let's take a look at the Play
store on the Nexus 10 tablet.

779
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,600
So here we have the store
on the tablet.

780
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,130
And it's the same content that
you would see on your phone or

781
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:12,600
anywhere else.

782
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,360
But it's presented in a way
that is much more richly

783
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,120
presented here on the tablet.

784
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,950
The content's organized
into collections.

785
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,570
We have some movie suggestions
there.

786
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:26,330
But the new Play Store isn't
just about looks.

787
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,420
It's also designed to
help you improve

788
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,150
discovery of your apps.

789
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,820
The Play Store home screen
adapts to you.

790
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,910
So here we see that I've
got some specific

791
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,370
recommendations for me.

792
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,955
I've got a book recommended
based on a previous book.

793
00:36:40,955 --> 00:36:43,460
I'm being recommended the movie
"Inception" because my

794
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,610
buddy Advay +1'd it and
some music and apps

795
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,620
recommendations as well.

796
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,150
But to give you an idea of how
this adapts to different

797
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,910
people, why don't go out on a
limb here a little bit and put

798
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,600
Jai's tablet up side by side so
we can see the difference.

799
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,410
And so here with Jai's tablet,
you see he gets the same types

800
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,370
of recommendations.

801
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:07,270
He's got movies and music, et
cetera because his friends

802
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,690
have + 1'd things or based on
his previous apps that he's

803
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,540
purchased, et cetera.

804
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,190
But one interesting thing that I
didn't see until now is that

805
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,410
it turns out you're
a Metallica fan?

806
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:17,880
All right.

807
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,890
We should hang out.

808
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,530
All right, I think we've learned
enough about Jai.

809
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,670
So these personalization
features are going to be

810
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,230
rolling out over the
coming weeks.

811
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,400
But the point is that the new
design of the Play Store gives

812
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,970
us an excellent foundation for
doing even more than what

813
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,660
you've just seen.

814
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,780
So we also know that many of
you have invested a lot of

815
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,430
energy in building awesome
tablet experiences.

816
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,390
And we want to ensure that your
work pays off and that

817
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,970
users are able to discover
your great tablet apps.

818
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:48,170
So starting today, we're going
to be providing a view in our

819
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,260
top charts that surfaces
applications that are designed

820
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,490
for tablets.

821
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,780
Now, this view here &mdash;

822
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,914
thank you.

823
00:37:55,914 --> 00:37:57,770
[APPLAUSE]

824
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,850
CHRIS YERGA: This shows apps
that meet our tablet app

825
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,830
design guidelines.

826
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:05,220
So they target tablet screen
sizes, use the screen real

827
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,820
estate on the tablets
effectively, et cetera.

828
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,660
And as Ellie showed you in the
demo before, in the dev

829
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,820
console you can get hints about
exactly what you should

830
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,040
be doing here if your app needs
some specific tweaks to

831
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,060
meet this criteria.

832
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,750
So I said that this UI scales
across a variety of devices.

833
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,780
So why don't we show you how
we're bringing this to the

834
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,245
rest of Play.

835
00:38:27,245 --> 00:38:29,540
Why don't we pop up
the laptop here.

836
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,670
So over the coming weeks, we're
going to be bringing the

837
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,940
same great Play experience
to the web as well.

838
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,160
You'll notice here that it's
the same consistent design.

839
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,630
We have the same content here
along with my personalized

840
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,820
recommendations.

841
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,040
But it's presented in a way that
really takes great use of

842
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,260
the laptop.

843
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,760
And we also have a new
navigation model here on the

844
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,530
left hand side that easily
allows me to switch between

845
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,550
apps, movies, music,
and books.

846
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,966

847
00:38:57,966 --> 00:39:02,360
[APPLAUSE]

848
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,370
CHRIS YERGA: You know, on the
run through we didn't put a

849
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,910
picture of a more handsome man
behind me up on the screen.

850
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,920
But I guess that's fine.

851
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,270
So that's the Play Store.

852
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,960
But the UX isn't just
about the store.

853
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,416
We also want to bring the same
great user experience to all

854
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,280
of the play apps themselves.

855
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,670
So over the coming weeks it's
going to be rolling out to all

856
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,960
the Play apps, books,
movies, magazines

857
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,485
and, of course, music.

858
00:39:25,485 --> 00:39:28,600

859
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,850
So you guys want to
hear about music?

860
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:33,450

861
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,730
Music unites us.

862
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,050
It's universal.

863
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,130
No matter who you are or where
you're from, the joy of music

864
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,510
is a constant.

865
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,390
And with ubiquitous mobile
devices, there's the potential

866
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,860
to bring that music,
bring that joy with

867
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,610
us wherever we are.

868
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,370
But when a bunch of us on the
Play team got together to talk

869
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:55,700
about the next generation of
our music service, we all

870
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,530
agreed that the reality was
somewhat different.

871
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:02,190
Yes, mobile devices give us more
choices than ever before.

872
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,625
But they weren't helping us
discover music we loved.

873
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,420
It felt more like work.

874
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,400
Like, when we were kids,
figuring out what album to

875
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,890
play was an event.

876
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,890
It was a ritual.

877
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:18,610
So why is it that managing my
que feels like a chore?

878
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:22,330
So we set out to build a music
service that didn't just give

879
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,760
you access to a world of music
but also helped guide you

880
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,770
through it.

881
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,510
And we started from a
great foundation.

882
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,410
On this very stage two years
ago, we launched our locker

883
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,830
service that allows you to
upload 20,000 of your songs,

884
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,860
stream them across all your
Android devices and the web.

885
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,000
And soon after, we launched our
music store, deals from

886
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,750
all the major labels
and Indies alike.

887
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:46,040
And so today, users in 13
countries globally are

888
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,150
enjoying their music
on Play music.

889
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,210
But what if we gave you access
to millions of tracks from our

890
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,950
store in addition to your
personal music library?

891
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,200
And what if we combine the power
of Google to understand

892
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,780
what you want to hear and get
you right to the music without

893
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,940
any hassle?

894
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,090
A music service that's about
music, and the technology

895
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,050
fades to the background.

896
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,570
We built that service.

897
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,670
And today I'm happy to announce
Google Play Music All

898
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,170
Access, a uniquely Google
approach to a subscription

899
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,110
music service.

900
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:25,340
[APPLAUSE]

901
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,450
CHRIS YERGA: Why don't we
show it to them, Jai.

902
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,700
Let's pop it up on the phone.

903
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,890

904
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,240
All Access starts
with explore.

905
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,130
It's the guided way for you to
browse am entire collection of

906
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,175
millions of tracks.

907
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:41,940
And from the moment you enter
explore, we provide

908
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,220
personalized recommendations
based on your listening

909
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,110
preferences.

910
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,410
So here's some of my
personalized recommendations.

911
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:51,340
We also have a section that we
can swipe over to that shows

912
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,960
featured content, top albums,
and songs as well as playlists

913
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,740
from our staff of music experts
that's always fresh.

914
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,800
But if you want to guide our
assistance, we can swipe over

915
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,430
and look into specific genres.

916
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:09,500
So we have 22 top level genres
with more to drill into.

917
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,140
And why don't we picked alt
Indie and go in there and show

918
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,410
them what it looks like?

919
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,340
So once we're in here, you see
expert powered recommendations

920
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,370
here, playlists that are curated
by our music editors

921
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,840
as well as top albums from the
genre and key albums that

922
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,850
define the genre.

923
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:27,440
But like everything in All
Access, anything you see you

924
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,010
can immediately start playing.

925
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,580
So Jai's picked a track
for us here.

926
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:36,320
[MUSIC PLAYING]

927
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,770
CHRIS YERGA: So,
so far so good.

928
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,670
But here's where the magic
starts because any thing that

929
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,390
I'm listening to in All Access
I can instantly turn into a

930
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,350
radio station.

931
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,310
So Jai hits start radio.

932
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,250
The song keeps playing.

933
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,450
But in the background, All
Access has made us a never

934
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,070
ending mix of related tracks.

935
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,740
Now, if we're curious about
what's coming up, we can swipe

936
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,380
to take a little peek ahead.

937
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,450
But more importantly, we can tap
on the Playlist icon and

938
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,477
see in detail everything that's
coming up and tailor it

939
00:43:04,477 --> 00:43:04,980
to our needs.

940
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,870
So if there's something
there we don't want to

941
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,570
hear, swipe it away.

942
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,270
Swipe it away.

943
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:15,230
[APPLAUSE]

944
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,250
You want to show them
reordering?

945
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,470
You can also reorder
tracks in the que.

946
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,170
So this is radio
without rules.

947
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:24,660
It's as lean back as you want
to or as interactive as you

948
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,380
want it to be.

949
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,630
Thank you.

950
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,229

951
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:33,040
All right, Sometimes you
know exactly what you

952
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,080
want to listen to.

953
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,670
And we're Google.

954
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,870
So there's always search
at the top.

955
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,390
So right now I'm in the mood
for some James Blake.

956
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:41,260
Why don't you go ahead
and light that up.

957
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,120
And so when &mdash; all right, one
James Blake fan over there.

958
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,450
That's great.

959
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:49,000
So why don't we pop into
the artist here?

960
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,040
And when we do, we see a couple
of things that are

961
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,850
interesting here about how All
Access blends my catalog with

962
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:57,230
all the millions of tracks
available to you.

963
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,520
So you see here that there's
one album that I previously

964
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,240
uploaded to the locker
from James Blake.

965
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,700
But if we scroll down, we see
the rest of his tracks and

966
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,550
albums that are available
to me in all

967
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,150
access blended together.

968
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:12,530
And I notice his most recent
album is available there.

969
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,950
So why don't you go ahead
and tap on that and

970
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,520
add it to my library.

971
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,810
So by adding it to my personal
library, now it shows up here

972
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:20,440
at the top.

973
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,810
It's easy for me to access
at all times.

974
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,250
My library contains all my
personal music that I uploaded

975
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,380
as well as anything that
I've discovered and

976
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,765
added from all access.

977
00:44:29,765 --> 00:44:32,340

978
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,260
But other times I just want
the music to start.

979
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,830
I want to get to music
with minimal effort.

980
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,640
That's where listen
now comes in.

981
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,320
Listen now brings the power of
Google to surface music we

982
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,520
know you're going to love.

983
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,970
There's always a fresh set
of choices in here.

984
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:50,440
So in my listen now view, you
see the album I just added as

985
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,770
well as some other tracks that
I've played recently.

986
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,510
There's also new releases from
artists that I enjoy.

987
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,720
And you'll also see interspersed
in here are radio

988
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,980
stations that All Access has
created for us automatically.

989
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,330
With listen now there's always
a great selection of music

990
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:10,310
available to me for my library
and All Access.

991
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,930
And every day it surprises me.

992
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:14,220
I can't wait for you all to have
your own magic moments

993
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,700
with listen now.

994
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,170
So so far that's been All
Access on the phone.

995
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,420
But, of course, it works
great on tablet and

996
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,710
web browsers as well.

997
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,570
So why don't we pop
up the laptop?

998
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:26,850
This is All Access on
the web browser.

999
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,460
As you can see, it has the same
great set of features.

1000
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,860
Listen now is here with all my
suggested content, get me one

1001
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,940
click to music.

1002
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,210
I've got my library, radio,
and, of course, explore.

1003
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,820
And I can enjoy All Access
whether I'm on my laptop, on

1004
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,670
my tablet, or on my phone.

1005
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,120
So to recap, All Access allows
you to explore millions of

1006
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,980
tracks effortlessly
on any device.

1007
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,080
Radio without rules,
it's completely

1008
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,590
interactive if you so choose.

1009
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:59,490
Google powered recommendations
and one click access to your

1010
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,210
music from listen now.

1011
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,190
And, of course, the best of
both worlds, your personal

1012
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,270
library blended with ours.

1013
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,110
That's All Access.

1014
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,940
Now, there's a lot more
I could show you.

1015
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,230
But really I want you all
to try it yourself.

1016
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:16,170
So let's talk about how
you can get it.

1017
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,870
All Access is priced at $9.99
a month in the US.

1018
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:23,730
But we're also giving everyone
a 30 day free trial.

1019
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:29,500
[APPLAUSE]

1020
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,190
Best of all, its launching
today in the US.

1021
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,170
And we'll be rolling out to
additional countries soon.

1022
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:39,070
And if you start a trial
by June 30, you'll pay

1023
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,674
only $7.99 a month.

1024
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:46,450
[APPLAUSE]

1025
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,290
CHRIS YERGA: That's
All Access.

1026
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,530
It's been my pleasure
to show it to you.

1027
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,330
And now I'm going to call
Hugo back to the stage.

1028
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:51,340
Thank you very much.

1029
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,740
[APPLAUSE]

1030
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,990
HUGO BARRA: Thanks, Chris.

1031
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:56,630

1032
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,790
We hope you guys liked
everything you saw here today.

1033
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:03,940
We talked about 900 million
Android, 48 billion app

1034
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,640
installs, a bunch of new tools
and developer services that

1035
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,260
help you build awesome apps,
find more users around the

1036
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,080
world, and, of course, monetize
your hard work.

1037
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:19,800
You also saw the new Google Play
Store as well as a taste

1038
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,490
of All Access, the brand new
music experience that's

1039
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,570
powered by Google.

1040
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:28,520
One thing we haven't talked
today about yet are devices.

1041
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,400
Now, this is not a
device give away.

1042
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,080
But I do have a pretty
cool announcement to

1043
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,336
share with you guys.

1044
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:39,370
The Android ecosystem is truly
amazing, great hardware and

1045
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:43,510
software experiences, a range
of form factors, and lots of

1046
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:47,080
choice for users including, by
the way, Google's own devices

1047
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,040
with the Nexus family that I'm
sure you know quite well.

1048
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,140
We continue to be blown away by
the great new devices that

1049
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,450
are coming out from our
partners, like, for example

1050
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:00,360
the HTC1 or the Samsung Galaxy
S4, for example.

1051
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,130
In fact, just like this
one right here.

1052
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,870
Now, there's actually something
a little bit

1053
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:09,790
different about this particular
GS4, for this

1054
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:13,830
particular Galaxy S4 from
Samsung, something that is not

1055
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:17,150
available yet but I want
to show you anyways.

1056
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:20,324
So why don't you take a look
at my home screen?

1057
00:48:20,324 --> 00:48:28,620
[APPLAUSE]

1058
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,910
HUGO BARRA: So that's
my home screen.

1059
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,200
I've got my Google Apps here
in my Google folder.

1060
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,650
If you scroll to the left,
that's my music widget, my

1061
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,590
calendar on the other screen.

1062
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,840
Go into notifications, a pretty
clean notification

1063
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:48,112
shade and quick settings also
right at your fingertips.

1064
00:48:48,112 --> 00:48:51,550
I'm pretty sure you guys are
getting this, right?

1065
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,100
What you're seeing
here is real.

1066
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,990
This is a Samsung Galaxy S4
running Android 4.2 Jelly Bean

1067
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,560
with the same software
experience that was shipped on

1068
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,930
our Nexus devices.

1069
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,840
It's Google's take on Android.

1070
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,232
And it feels really awesome
on the Galaxy S4.

1071
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:14,424
[APPLAUSE]

1072
00:49:14,424 --> 00:49:17,640
HUGO BARRA: In fact, this
version of the Samsung Galaxy

1073
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,170
S4 will be available directly
through Google Play in the US.

1074
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:26,570
We're selling an unlocked model
that works on both AT&T

1075
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:31,460
and T-Mobile with LTE support,
16 gigabytes of memory,

1076
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,380
expandable with a SD
card, of course.

1077
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,560
And also it is bootloader
unlocked.

1078
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,840
[APPLAUSE]

1079
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,100
HUGO BARRA: I knew
you'd like that.

1080
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,560
And it will receive system
updates promptly with every

1081
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,534
Android platform update.

1082
00:49:47,534 --> 00:49:53,390
[APPLAUSE]

1083
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,760
HUGO BARRA: This version of the
Samsung Galaxy S4 will be

1084
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:04,050
on sale starting on June 26
on Google Play for $649.

1085
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,760
So that's what we have.

1086
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,430
It is a spectacular device.

1087
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:10,610
So I want to thank you guys
for your support.

1088
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:13,150
I look forward to talking with
many of you over the next

1089
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,340
three days and seeing you
all in the sessions.

1090
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,670
And with that, let
me ask Sundar to

1091
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:18,630
come back to the stage.

1092
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:19,436
Thank you.

1093
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:24,396
[APPLAUSE]

1094
00:50:24,396 --> 00:51:18,316
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1095
00:51:18,316 --> 00:51:25,160
[APPLAUSE]

1096
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,930
SUNDAR PICHAI: We're going to
switch from Android to talk

1097
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:30,100
about our other important
platform, another open

1098
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,790
platform, Chrome.

1099
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:36,710
As I said earlier, Chrome
started with the goal to help

1100
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,870
make the web better, both
as a platform and as an

1101
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,640
experience for users.

1102
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,420
It's been an incredible
journey.

1103
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,450
We've had amazing adoption
from our users.

1104
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:52,930
And last year at Google I/O we
had reached 450 million or 450

1105
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:54,860
million monthly active users.

1106
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,410
We had reported weekly
users before.

1107
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,310
But we are switching to monthly
to be consistent with

1108
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,490
the rest of this presentation
and industry metrics.

1109
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:05,920
Since then we've had amazing
momentum, and we've added over

1110
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,260
300 million new users just in
the last 12 months alone.

1111
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,640
And so today we are at
over 750 million

1112
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,087
active users of Chrome.

1113
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:20,340
[APPLAUSE]

1114
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,040
SUNDAR PICHAI: Chrome
increasingly is

1115
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,500
being used on mobile.

1116
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,540
What excites us is a lot of this
new growth is coming on

1117
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,990
phones and tablets.

1118
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:32,180
We launched Chrome both
for Android and iOS.

1119
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,240
And we are just beginning
to start pushing

1120
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,770
the mobile web forward.

1121
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,170
A lot of what you'll hear today
is about how we can push

1122
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,560
the mobile web forward.

1123
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,000
It is in its early days.

1124
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,240
But we think we can do to the
mobile web what we did for the

1125
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,060
desktop web.

1126
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,190
Chrome also serves as the
foundation for Chrome OS, a

1127
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:51,750
computing system designed
for and but

1128
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,820
entirely around the web.

1129
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,790
And we brought a lot of it
together last October by

1130
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,600
launching the Samsung
Chromebook, what we viewed as

1131
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,430
the perfect additional computer
for everyone.

1132
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:06,350
At $249, it was thin,
light, portable.

1133
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,840
And people are buying it as
the second, third, fourth

1134
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,640
computer in their homes.

1135
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,470
It's been over 200 days
since launched.

1136
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:17,450
And it's been number one on
Amazon in laptops for 190

1137
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:20,380
consecutive days in
that time window.

1138
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:25,090
[APPLAUSE]

1139
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:27,140
SUNDAR PICHAI: It is an
ecosystem play, and we have

1140
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,510
many more partners joining
our journey.

1141
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:32,680
Acer, Lenovo, HP are all
shipping Chromebooks now.

1142
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,710
And we're expanding our
presence in retail.

1143
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:37,630
Two months ago we
also announced

1144
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,250
the Chromebook Pixel.

1145
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:43,010
The goal behind the Pixel was
literally to design the best

1146
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,640
laptop out there possible.

1147
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,440
The screen on this laptop
is gorgeous.

1148
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,740
It's the highest resolution
display that's ever

1149
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,960
shipped on a laptop.

1150
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,940
And it has full touch enable.

1151
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,580
Its precision engineered with
the best custom components

1152
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,870
available out there.

1153
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:00,330
Our goal with the Pixel was
to get it in the hands of

1154
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:03,095
developers so that they can
build the next generation of

1155
00:54:03,095 --> 00:54:05,130
web experiences.

1156
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,360
We're going to have a lot more
to talk about Chrome OS later

1157
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,230
this year, and we are really
investing a lot in this area.

1158
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,580
But I want to come back to
Chrome for a minute.

1159
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:18,300
We talked about how in this
multi-screen world people are

1160
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,910
using different types
of devices,

1161
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,690
including phones and tablets.

1162
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:25,160
With Chrome, our goal has been
to make sure it's your web.

1163
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:29,400
You sign into Chrome, you get
your experience consistently

1164
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,390
across all your devices,
your web everywhere

1165
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,190
personalized for you.

1166
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:36,160
And to do that well,
we really need to

1167
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,020
take mobile web forward.

1168
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:41,690
So we're going to show you an
example of how the mobile web

1169
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:43,270
is evolving.

1170
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,870
What we are about to show you
is a preview which Warner

1171
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:49,850
Brothers and the developers
at North Kingdom have put

1172
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,320
together for the upcoming
"Hobbit" movie.

1173
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,950
And Kan is going to
help me with this.

1174
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,150
We're going to get this
up on screen.

1175
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,500
This is running on a
Pixel right now.

1176
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,330
And as you can see, this is
what the web shines for.

1177
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,250
They want a trailer.

1178
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:07,020
They want a preview
for their movie.

1179
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,720
You're not going to write an
app and get everyone to

1180
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,500
install an app on every
one of their devices.

1181
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,930
You write a web experience and
you expect people to use it

1182
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:16,080
independent of the
device they have.

1183
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,900
So it's on a Pixel.

1184
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:22,000
Thanks to HTML 3D CSS, you
can see it works great.

1185
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,330
Kan can touch and move around.

1186
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:24,900
The clouds look great.

1187
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,640
And it works really well.

1188
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,840
So far, not that surprising.

1189
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,690
But we're going to
switch now from a

1190
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,570
Chromebook Pixel to a tablet.

1191
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:36,910
And we're going to show Chrome
running on Nexus 10.

1192
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:41,700
And you can see there is no
difference in the experience.

1193
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,570
A lot of what we're going to
talk about today is the same

1194
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:47,290
capabilities which you're used
to on the Chrome on desktop

1195
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,440
are all coming to Chrome
on Android.

1196
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,420
So it feels exactly the same way
you would see on a Pixel

1197
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,320
on a Nexus 10 as well.

1198
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,270
Let's dive in deeper.

1199
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,080
Kan is going to start playing
a game on the Nexus 10.

1200
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:07,120
And I guess the goal of this
game is for hobbits to avoid

1201
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,300
being eaten by the trolls.

1202
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,530
It's a new game upcoming.

1203
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,400
It is a 3D game.

1204
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,860
And it's based on WebGL.

1205
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,430
Can we get the game
up on screen?

1206
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:21,690
We can see it there.

1207
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:26,320
And we are running this, again,
on Chrome on Nexus 10.

1208
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,430
And the reason we are able
to play this game

1209
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:30,780
is thanks to WebGL.

1210
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:35,250
This wasn't possible on
the web last year.

1211
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,330
And you will hear the
search team &mdash;

1212
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,900
OK, so we have it up
and running now.

1213
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,770
Kan's goal is to avoid the
trolls and not be eaten for

1214
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,840
dinner as a hobbit.

1215
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,860
I guess he lost very,
very quickly there.

1216
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,331
[LAUGHTER]

1217
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:53,140
SUNDAR PICHAI: Look, Web GL is
something new to Chrome, and

1218
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,240
it makes this experience
possible.

1219
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,780
You will say Google Maps team
talk later in the presentation

1220
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,620
about how they're using WebGL.

1221
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,760
Let's show you one more thing.

1222
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,700
We're going to zoom in the map
in Middle Earth in a place

1223
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,190
called Rivendell.

1224
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:10,000
All this is happening on mobile,
Chrome on mobile.

1225
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,300
Kan is going to start swiping
his way through.

1226
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,680
Thanks to web audio APIs, as
he gestures around on his

1227
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,000
touch screen, the
music changes.

1228
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,090
And you can see how the
experience is very

1229
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:23,820
interactive.

1230
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,590
There's touch and web
audio APIs working

1231
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:30,280
together on the web.

1232
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,130
I think you can really start
creating powerful experiences

1233
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:36,540
on the web and increasingly run
it on phones and tablets.

1234
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,940
And we are making a lot
of progress there.

1235
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:42,490
So I'm going to invite Linus
Upson onto the stage to talk

1236
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,070
in detail about all the
APIs we are adding

1237
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,170
to the mobile web.

1238
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,350
Linus.

1239
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:54,224
[APPLAUSE]

1240
00:57:54,224 --> 00:58:00,630

1241
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:03,310
LINUS UPSON: So just a few weeks
ago the web celebrated

1242
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,290
its 20th birthday.

1243
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:09,000
And the unique properties that
transformed desktop computing

1244
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,400
from the web, the fact that
everything is a link,

1245
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,110
everything is searchable by
default, makes it possible

1246
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:18,370
with just a few key strokes
for anyone in the world to

1247
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,990
find billions of different
web pages.

1248
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:24,580
Applications, video content is
instantly discoverable and

1249
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:27,220
shareable, no need to
install software, no

1250
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,400
need to update software.

1251
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,130
And on the Chrome team, our
goal is to make the web

1252
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:36,720
better, both on desktop and on
mobile, better for users and

1253
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,980
better for developers.

1254
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,630
But that doesn't mean
loading the

1255
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:42,560
browser up full of features.

1256
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,610
The browser's a means,
not an end.

1257
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,630
And so we're always trying to
figure out how to make the

1258
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,650
browser smaller and faster.

1259
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,490
So we focus on three
things, speed

1260
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,550
simplicity, and security.

1261
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:56,850
And we're bringing that
same focus to mobile.

1262
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:59,470
Let's take a look at speed
to start with.

1263
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:04,640
When we first launched Chrome,
it's JavaScript engine V8 was

1264
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,150
20 times faster than anything
else out there.

1265
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:09,600
And in the four and a half years
since, we've continued

1266
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,500
to make it faster still.

1267
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:15,310
Just in the last year you can
see we've improved performance

1268
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:18,910
of V8 by almost 25%
on the desktop.

1269
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:22,030
But the games on mobile
are even bigger.

1270
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:25,300
In the last year we've seen
the performance improve by

1271
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,250
more than 50% on mobile.

1272
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,880
These are the kinds
of things &mdash;

1273
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:35,750
[APPLAUSE]

1274
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,120
LINUS UPSON: These are the kinds
of things that enable

1275
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,590
the next generation of the
mobile web and of mobile web

1276
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:41,130
applications.

1277
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:44,270
Of course, the V8 team is always
looking to optimize new

1278
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47,300
use cases because people are
always pushing JavaScript in

1279
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,770
new directions.

1280
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:52,475
Recently Mozilla introduced a
very clever way to compile C

1281
00:59:52,475 --> 00:59:57,460
or C++ code down into a subset
of JavaScript called ASM.js.

1282
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,460
And this has gotten a lot of
attention recently because it

1283
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,880
allows you to then access all of
that code that you have in

1284
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,590
C and C++ and be able to
run it on the web.

1285
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:08,040
And this is JavaScript that's
not written by humans.

1286
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,140
It's written by compilers.

1287
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,160
So it looks very different than
the kind of JavaScript

1288
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,830
we've optimized for
in the past.

1289
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:18,330
And in the last month alone,
we've gotten over 2.4 times

1290
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:22,040
speed boost running this
ASM.js code in V8.

1291
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,290
And there's tons more
optimization to come.

1292
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:29,700
But, of course, JavaScript is
only one component of speed.

1293
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,230
When you download a web page,
more than 60&% of the bytes

1294
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:36,030
that come across your internet
connection are images.

1295
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:37,820
And it's growing.

1296
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,400
So we've developed an open
source royalty free

1297
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,960
compression technology
called WebP.

1298
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,720

1299
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,370
So these two images here, you
see the one on the left as

1300
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:49,190
JPEG, the one on the
right is WebP.

1301
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:51,540
They're both at the
same quality.

1302
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,130
But let's take a look
at the sizes.

1303
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:57,360
The WebP image is 30%
smaller than a JPEG

1304
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,620
image at the same quality.

1305
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:03,430
The benefits of this for image
rich websites is compelling.

1306
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,850
It saves on bandwidth.

1307
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:06,630
It saves on power, particularly
on mobile

1308
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:07,490
computing devices.

1309
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:11,830
And we're seeing it adopted by
properties like Google+, like

1310
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:14,035
Facebook, particularly
on their mobile apps.

1311
01:01:14,035 --> 01:01:17,880

1312
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,130
Oh.

1313
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:21,140

1314
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:25,610
So WebP supports not only
lossless compression, but also

1315
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:28,920
lossy compression, transparency,
color profiles,

1316
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:35,330
metadata and, unfortunately,
animated images as well.

1317
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:38,165
[APPLAUSE]

1318
01:01:38,165 --> 01:01:42,770
LINUS UPSON: So you can use WebP
to replace JPEGs, PNGs,

1319
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,370
as well as animated GIFs.

1320
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:46,620
I'm sorry.

1321
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,370

1322
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:53,240
Of course, videos are a
big part of the web.

1323
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,370
By the end of 2012, over
half of mobile

1324
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:58,620
internet traffic was video.

1325
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,350
We need to make videos
smaller.

1326
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:05,910
With WebM, we've created an open
royalty free container

1327
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:08,350
media file format for the web.

1328
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,260
So let's take a look
at two videos.

1329
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:15,940
One of these is encoded in 264,
which is probably what

1330
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,610
you're seeing today
on the web.

1331
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:21,690
The other is encoded in WebM's
next generation codec, VP9.

1332
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,680
The bar charts show you
the real time bit

1333
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,930
rate of the two videos.

1334
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:30,340
When we get to the end, we'll
see what the sizes of each are

1335
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,230
and how much smaller VP9 is.

1336
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,700
For this particular video &mdash;

1337
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:39,849
[APPLAUSE]

1338
01:02:39,849 --> 01:02:40,980
LINUS UPSON: For
this particular

1339
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:44,400
video, VP9 was 63% smaller.

1340
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,230
Running across a wide range of
videos and a wide range of

1341
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,810
resolutions, we see about a
50% reduction in size with

1342
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:53,790
VP9, which is a huge
bandwidth savings.

1343
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,380
So if you're paying money for
your mobile data plan, this is

1344
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,020
enormous for you.

1345
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,530
And it's great to see that
YouTube is going to be rolling

1346
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:05,250
out support for VP9
later this year.

1347
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:08,140
Now, of course, we want all
websites to take advantage of

1348
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,730
these new technologies.

1349
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:12,980
But until they're everywhere,
what we've done is we've built

1350
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:16,660
a data compression proxy
for Chrome for mobile.

1351
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,240
And you can see here it's
easy to turn on.

1352
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,305
You can go to bandwidth
management

1353
01:03:20,305 --> 01:03:22,650
to reduce data usage.

1354
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:25,990
And it shows you how much data
you're actually saving.

1355
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:28,790
So let's take a look at the real
data for one user here.

1356
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:32,370
They save 46% of their data over
the course of a month.

1357
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,630
And when we've been running
this in the Android beta

1358
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:37,180
channel &mdash; and many of you can
try it out right now &mdash;

1359
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,460
we see an average of about
50% data compression.

1360
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:44,280
We rewrite the HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript to make it smaller.

1361
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,640
We transform images into WebP.

1362
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,980
And we speak the SPDY network
protocol to get you fewer bits

1363
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:53,480
faster but get you all the bits
from the web page that

1364
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,730
you're looking for.

1365
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,630

1366
01:03:56,630 --> 01:04:01,130
So beyond just making web pages
faster, we want to make

1367
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:04,030
things faster and simpler
for users.

1368
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:07,230
One of the hardest things you
can do on your phone today is

1369
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:08,960
buy something.

1370
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,200
The average checkout
process is about 21

1371
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,820
steps on your phone.

1372
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:17,590
So it's no surprise that the
abandonment rate of shopping

1373
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:21,710
carts on mobile phones
is around 97%.

1374
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:24,030
We can do much better
than this.

1375
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:28,580
So by building on the existing
HTML5 auto complete spec,

1376
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:30,840
we've built something in Chrome,
both on desktop and in

1377
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,600
mobile, that collects all of
your payment information when

1378
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,880
you enter it anywhere, syncs it
across all of your devices.

1379
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:42,600
So now when you come to check
out on a website, you press

1380
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,560
check out, you see this form.

1381
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,660
Chrome already knows all of
your payment information.

1382
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:47,880
It shows it to you in a form.

1383
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,820
You can look at it and you say,
yep, that's what I want.

1384
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,140
And you click Submit
and you're done.

1385
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,990
So this is going to make
shopping from your phone much,

1386
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:57,138
much easier.

1387
01:04:57,138 --> 01:05:03,840
[APPLAUSE]

1388
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,870
LINUS UPSON: And there's a
session, if you want to learn

1389
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:09,330
more about this, later today.

1390
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:10,580
It's called &mdash;

1391
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:13,610

1392
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,710
I bet it has payments
in the name.

1393
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,590
I forgot what it is.

1394
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:17,400
But it's on the calendar
for today.

1395
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,420
Standardizing payments
on the web.

1396
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:25,860
OK, so not just programs, not
just users, but we also want

1397
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:28,940
to make developers more
productive and make life

1398
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,920
simpler for them as well.

1399
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,820
So for the last couple of years
we've been working on

1400
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:36,610
some new fundamental technology
in the web platform

1401
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,520
called web components.

1402
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,670
For the first time you're going
to be able to build your

1403
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,680
own HTML tags.

1404
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,440
You can build your own HTML tags
by taking smaller bits of

1405
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,590
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and
putting them into a first

1406
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,870
class component.

1407
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:53,950
And that component can be
reshared between applications,

1408
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,300
between phones, between tablets,
between desktops so

1409
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,510
that you can be much more
productive and have

1410
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:02,690
applications that are much more
delightful for users.

1411
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:06,000
We're also working on the first
tool kit to natively

1412
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,670
take advantage of
web components.

1413
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:11,580
And in this tool kit it really
captures the modern, elegant

1414
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:14,180
design philosophy you've been
seeing in a lot of the recent

1415
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:17,910
Google applications,
particularly the mobile ones.

1416
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:19,890
This tool kit project actually
has been open

1417
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:21,290
source since the beginning.

1418
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:24,500
And some of you have stumbled
upon it and found it.

1419
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,560
But it's still very early.

1420
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,010
But the vision for
it is clear.

1421
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:30,620
We want this elegant UI
framework that works across

1422
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,690
all form factors, all devices.

1423
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:36,470
And we put together a short
video to give you an idea

1424
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:38,620
about where we're going
with the toolkit.

1425
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:39,930
Let's play the video.

1426
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,930
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

1427
01:06:41,930 --> 01:07:27,930

1428
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:29,820
LINUS UPSON: So you can see our
goal here really is to be

1429
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:33,080
able to allow developers like
you create your own tags,

1430
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,240
reuse them in a way that makes
sense on a phone, be able to

1431
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,750
take that same component, reuse
it on a tablet, combine

1432
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,510
them in different ways for
desktop applications.

1433
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:42,830
And it's something that's
tremendously exciting.

1434
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:44,320
It's still early, as I said.

1435
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,270
It's not ready for consumption
by regular developers.

1436
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:49,030
But if you're interested in
learning more about where

1437
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:51,590
we're going and help us to find
the vision of the future,

1438
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:54,010
please come to the web
components in action session

1439
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:55,260
on Thursday.

1440
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,220

1441
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:01,060
Now, we've been talking today a
lot about Chrome across all

1442
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,480
of your different screens.

1443
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,624
So why not build a fun
experience to show that off?

1444
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:12,740
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1445
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:15,340
LINUS UPSON: So Racer is a
multiplayer, multi-screen

1446
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:15,980
experiment.

1447
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,740
And all you need to
play is Chrome.

1448
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:21,529
Regardless of device Android or
iOS, phone or tablet, you

1449
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:23,660
just need to click a link
and get started.

1450
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,930
So we've got some volunteers to
come help us show it off.

1451
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:31,850

1452
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:34,050
So while they're coming up,
why don't we take a closer

1453
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:35,300
look at the devices here?

1454
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:49,290

1455
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:50,450
We have a ring around
the team.

1456
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,600
This is Arno Weber who manages
the Chrome Mobile team.

1457
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,859
He's an actual race
car driver.

1458
01:08:55,859 --> 01:08:59,000
We'll see how he does in
the electronic form.

1459
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,880
So this game is a simple
little racing game.

1460
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,740
I don't know if you remember
the little slot car racing

1461
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:05,800
games when you were a kid?

1462
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,899
You pull the trigger, zoom
around the track.

1463
01:09:07,899 --> 01:09:10,470
But if you go too fast,
the car spins out.

1464
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:11,990
That's essentially what these
guys are going to

1465
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:13,240
be trying to do.

1466
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,490

1467
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:17,450
So are we ready to switch
to the overhead?

1468
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,819
Thanks.

1469
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:21,792
So, Ken, take it away.

1470
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:22,284
KEN LIU: Great.

1471
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:23,268
Thanks, Linus.

1472
01:09:23,268 --> 01:09:26,200
OK, so this game is
really simple.

1473
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,520
Once I start the game, all you
have to do is press down to

1474
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:31,920
accelerate and let
go to decelerate.

1475
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,870
Basically, when you go around
the corners, you don't want to

1476
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:34,750
be going too fast.

1477
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:36,919
So I'm going to start a race
here and I'm going to join it

1478
01:09:36,919 --> 01:09:38,169
from these devices.

1479
01:09:38,169 --> 01:09:41,914

1480
01:09:41,914 --> 01:09:45,810
OK, let me click Start.

1481
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,210
You know, you guys look
like professionals.

1482
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:50,790
So I'm going to click
Ridiculous.

1483
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,630
We're going to go ridiculous
on this one guys.

1484
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:56,140
LINUS UPSON: I predict lots of
cars will fly off the track.

1485
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,480
KEN LIU: All right,
so pick your cars.

1486
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,350
Are you going to use this one?

1487
01:09:58,350 --> 01:09:58,590
OK.

1488
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:00,280
Then I'm going to use
the iOS device.

1489
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,800
And tap when you're ready.

1490
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,050
Let's get this game started.

1491
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:08,520

to hold on yet.

behind the Pixel was to

literally build the best laptop
possible out there.

01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,365
I'm holding one up in my hand?

1549
01:13:41,365 --> 01:13:51,550
[APPLAUSE]

1550
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:54,140
SUNDAR PICHAI: We're going to
give each and every one of you

1551
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:55,630
a brand new Pixel.

1552
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:58,100
I've been asked to say it's
not ready until 2:00 PM.

1553
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,790
So please don't leave in the
middle of the Keynote.

1554
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:02,930
But we're very excited.

1555
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:06,630
Our goal behind the Pixel was
to make sure that developers

1556
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:09,120
had a chance to get the web
ready for the next generation

1557
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,730
experience with full touch
and high resolution.

1558
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:14,025
So I can't wait to see what
you all to do with it.

1559
01:14:14,025 --> 01:14:15,390
We're incredibly excited.

1560
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:17,830
A lot of us use it as our
day to day computer.

1561
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:26,000
[APPLAUSE]

1562
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,260
SUNDAR PICHAI: So we've talked
about Android and Chrome.

1563
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,470
And our goal behind these
platforms is to make sure

1564
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,520
developers can build amazing
experiences on

1565
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,450
top of these platforms.

1566
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:37,110
We want to now give you a real
life example of how this all

1567
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,400
comes together.

1568
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,890
And we're going to do
that by talking

1569
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,050
about education briefly.

1570
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:44,890
A lot of us at Google are
deeply passionate about

1571
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:49,280
education because it's an area
where we can really see the

1572
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,640
impact technology can have on
people's lives, especially the

1573
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,200
lives of children.

1574
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,830
And so we are investing
a lot in education.

1575
01:14:56,830 --> 01:15:01,160
And for us, the journey started
with Google Apps.

1576
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,710
Google Apps are incredibly
popular in

1577
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,530
schools around the world.

1578
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:09,180
There are over 25 million users
of Google Apps in over

1579
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:13,170
200 countries all around the
world, in schools, in

1580
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:15,510
universities, and so on.

1581
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:20,150
Just in the United States, 74
of the top 100 universities

1582
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,380
fully run on Google Apps.

1583
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:26,230
Seven of the eight Ivy
League universities &mdash;

1584
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,730
for those of you who are from
Dartmouth, you may want to

1585
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:30,970
start nudging your IT
administrator there.

1586
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,720
But seven of the eight
Ivy League

1587
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,790
schools use Google Apps.

1588
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:37,920
Large public school systems
like Chicago, et cetera,

1589
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,950
completely run on Google Apps.

1590
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:42,320
And the momentum
is incredible.

1591
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,540
But we want to take
it a step further.

1592
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,100
What we want to do is to bring
both Android and Chrome into

1593
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,960
educational institutions around
the world so that both

1594
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,250
Google and all of you can build
applications to really

1595
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:57,270
change how computing and
technology is used in schools.

1596
01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:00,550
We are beginning to invest a lot
for Android in education.

1597
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:01,980
And we want to give
you an update.

1598
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:03,250
To do that, I'm going
to invite Chris

1599
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,060
Yerga back on stage.

1600
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:12,560
[APPLAUSE]

1601
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,025
CHRIS YERGA: Thanks, Sundar.

1602
01:16:14,025 --> 01:16:17,480
So as we've heard, Android is
growing incredibly fast.

1603
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,020
And its momentum is changing
everything.

1604
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:22,950
But there's still a big part
of all of our lives and the

1605
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:25,510
lives of our kids that
mobile technology

1606
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:27,190
hasn't really touched.

1607
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:29,700
When I go visit my kids'
classrooms, it looks pretty

1608
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,800
much exactly like it did
when I went to school.

1609
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,520
So a bunch of us in Android
asked educators why is there

1610
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,480
so much talk about technology
in schools

1611
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,960
but so little impact?

1612
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,520
And what we heard was
really interesting.

1613
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,780
Teachers told us that in
education there's a huge gap

1614
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,410
between what's possible with
technology and what's

1615
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:51,740
practical, especially with
mobile technology.

1616
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:55,410
And then they told us it was
Google's job to fix this.

1617
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:57,560
[LAUGHTER]

1618
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,500
CHRIS YERGA: Google should make
it affordable to give

1619
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,590
every student a tablet.

1620
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:03,380
And Google should make it so
that it's not so crazy to

1621
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,740
manage all those devices.

1622
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:08,290
And Google, finally, should make
it way easier to find the

1623
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,420
best tools and content from
a really diverse set of

1624
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:15,140
developers and get that content
to the right students.

1625
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,000
We agreed.

1626
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,950
So today I'm really excited to
announce a new initiative,

1627
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:21,500
which will make it easy and
affordable for schools to put

1628
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,710
Android tablets in the hands of
all their kids and to load

1629
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:27,790
them up with powerful
educational content and tools.

1630
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:30,070
And I want to give you a sneak
peak of one of the key parts

1631
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:33,280
of this effort, Google Play for
Education, built from the

1632
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,090
ground up to meet the unique
content needs of educators.

1633
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:38,367
Let's take a look.

1634
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:45,680
[APPLAUSE]

1635
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,330
CHRIS YERGA: So the first thing
you'll notice is that

1636
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,890
Google Play for Education is
organized by categories

1637
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:52,040
educators care about,
namely subject

1638
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,790
matter and grade level.

1639
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:57,160
For example, say I'm the K-6
math subject matter expert in

1640
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,150
my school district.

1641
01:17:58,150 --> 01:17:59,820
And I want to find an
educational app that my

1642
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:02,130
incoming kindergartners can use
to sharpen their problem

1643
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:03,260
solving skills.

1644
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:06,230
So I click on Math,
Kindergarten.

1645
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:09,360
And immediately I see a bunch of
apps from a diverse set of

1646
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,640
partners, including
NASA and PBS.

1647
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,890
Also, each app has been
recommended by a group of

1648
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,750
educators as useful for teaching
kindergarten math.

1649
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:21,440
This is key because teachers
trust other teachers.

1650
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:26,260
So Kids Numbers and Math from
Intellijoy looks really good.

1651
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:27,390
I'll start with the
free version.

1652
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:29,800
Remember, I'm not shopping
for myself here.

1653
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,430
Because this school is using
Google Apps for Education and

1654
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:35,360
every student has a Google
account, I can just enter the

1655
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,040
name of the Google group of
these students and, bam, all

1656
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,850
500 kindergartners in my
district will instantly get

1657
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:42,100
this app on their tablets.

1658
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:49,270
[APPLAUSE]

1659
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:51,080
CHRIS YERGA: Now say a few weeks
have gone by and I'm

1660
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,460
really impressed with the math
skills that kids are learning

1661
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:54,530
from Kids Numbers and Math.

1662
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:56,590
So I want to upgrade to
the paid version so

1663
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:58,080
the kids can go deeper.

1664
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,640
Rather than enter a credit card,
which is not how schools

1665
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,530
work, I can just charge these
500 licenses against a balance

1666
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:07,220
funded by a school
purchase order.

1667
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,880
And one more thing, notice
that the store

1668
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,440
doesn't just have apps.

1669
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,220
You can discover books and
YouTube educational videos and

1670
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:16,983
push them to Android tablets
in exactly the same way.

1671
01:19:16,983 --> 01:19:24,880
[APPLAUSE]

1672
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,340
CHRIS YERGA: Pilot sites like
Kipp Bridge Charter School and

1673
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:30,050
Hillsborough Township Public
Schools are already going

1674
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:31,290
crazy for this.

1675
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:35,910
Six elementary schools in New
Jersey used 550 different

1676
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:38,950
third party apps during a single
day in our pilot, all

1677
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:41,430
of them discovered and
downloaded by teachers in

1678
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:43,240
Google Play for Education.

1679
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:46,200
Multiply that pilot by millions
of classrooms in the

1680
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,960
US and you can see there's a
huge opportunity here for

1681
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,240
educators, students, and
for you as developers.

1682
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,500
So this is where you come in.

1683
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,300
We're doing the heavy lifting
of building Play for

1684
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:59,160
Education, bringing it to the
schools, making it easy for

1685
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,200
them to find great content
and buy it in bulk.

1686
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,380
Now you can focus on what you do
best, creating awesome and

1687
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:08,040
innovative educational
content.

1688
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,420
We're going to be launching
Google Play for

1689
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,030
Education in the fall.

1690
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:13,190
But starting this summer, we'll
be ready to accept your

1691
01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:14,040
app submissions.

1692
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,970
Check out our developer
micro site at

1693
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:20,210
developer.android.com/edu where
we've posted guidelines

1694
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:22,520
on how to build awesome
K-12 apps.

1695
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:26,170
Also, come find us at the
education sandbox here at I/O.

1696
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:27,299
Thanks, everyone.

1697
01:20:27,299 --> 01:20:37,090
[APPLAUSE]

1698
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:40,290
SUNDAR PICHAI: It's great to see
Android making it's foray

1699
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:40,960
into education.

1700
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,420
We're going to invest a lot.

1701
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,900
We've already been doing
this with Chromebooks.

1702
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:48,070
Chromebooks are really ideally
suited for education because

1703
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:51,200
this literally no set up,
no administration.

1704
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,520
You open the device, you're good
to go, and you have the

1705
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,710
power of web within you.

1706
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:59,660
Just last year alone, we had
over 1,000 schools in the

1707
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:02,450
United States running
Chromebooks.

1708
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:05,850
In the four months this year,
we've added 2,000 new schools

1709
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:08,330
and Chromebooks are going
mainstream in education in

1710
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:11,500
schools in the United States
just like Google Apps.

1711
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,300
And the area where this
all came together

1712
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,980
beautifully is Malaysia.

1713
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,910
So I want to talk about
that for a minute.

1714
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:20,130
Malaysia has a nationalized
education system.

1715
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:23,590
They have 10,000 schools in
the country distributed,

1716
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:27,070
several of them in poor,
rural areas.

1717
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:29,640
So they really wanted to provide
for 4G connectivity

1718
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,770
throughout to all 10,000
schools to

1719
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:33,360
level the playing field.

1720
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,900
And they're deploying Google
Apps along with Chromebooks in

1721
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,220
primary and secondary schools
so that they can bring

1722
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,740
computing in their schools.

1723
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:44,710
So let's take a look at
what they're doing.

1724
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:46,210
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

1725
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:49,170
-Malaysia has so
much to offer.

1726
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:52,060
There's so much untapped
potential.

1727
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:54,960
Just to walk into one of these
small villages and look at the

1728
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,710
eyes of those children in that
school, you see that spark,

1729
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,762
little fire in their eyes.

1730
01:22:01,762 --> 01:22:05,850
There's this whole world out
there that would allow you to

1731
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:08,930
experience learning
beyond what you

1732
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:11,780
ever thought possible.

1733
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:14,620
-And a lot of our students don't
have internet access.

1734
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:17,940
A lot of them were
just left behind.

1735
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:21,890
-In Malaysia we place a huge
investment in the education of

1736
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:23,430
our young children.

1737
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:27,440
-We're providing 4G connectivity
to all schools

1738
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,920
across the country.

1739
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,090
And the fact that we can
spread it across 10,000

1740
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:35,480
schools is amazing.

1741
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,188
-Learning had to be
anytime, anyplace.

1742
01:22:38,188 --> 01:22:41,670
You didn't have to be in a state
of the art classroom.

1743
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:44,130
But you could be with a
chromebook sitting in a field

1744
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:47,190
and experiencing world
class learning.

1745
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:48,990
-It is so exciting
to be a part of

1746
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:51,240
education in Malaysia today.

1747
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:55,050
This power that you place in a
child's hand and you say, the

1748
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:56,800
web is your school.

1749
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,050
Go and learn.

1750
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:04,600

1753
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,140
SUNDAR PICHAI: Look, to me and
to a lot of us, this is what

1754
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:19,220
the journey of computing
is about.

1755
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:22,010
What we are doing in eduction
on top of platforms like

1756
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:25,770
Android and Chrome, we can do
it for users everywhere,

1757
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:29,390
including the other five billion
people on the planet.

1758
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:32,470
Android and Chrome are designed
for not just Google,

1759
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:35,200
but for you all to create
amazing experiences.

1760
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,010
We're going to switch now and
talk about what we are doing

1761
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:41,740
on Google, what we call as the
best of Google on top of

1762
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:42,950
Android and Chrome.

1763
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:44,990
You're going to hear from three
teams, from the Google+

1764
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:48,410
team, from the Search team,
and from the Maps team.

1765
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:52,274
And we'll get things started
with Vic Gundotra and Google+.

1766
01:23:52,274 --> 01:23:52,771
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

1767
01:23:52,771 --> 01:23:55,753
-Among the most basic of human
needs is the need to connect

1768
01:23:55,753 --> 01:23:57,741
with others.

1769
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,580
With a smile or laugh, we
connect with people every

1770
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:03,640
single day.

1771
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,560
But the meaning of our real
world connections often gets

1772
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,580
lost online.

1773
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:12,020
And so began the Google+
project to help make

1774
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:16,540
connecting online more like
we do in real life.

1775
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:19,180
So you can share the things you
love with the people you

1776
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:23,310
love and get closer to the
people you care about, make

1777
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:28,376
discoveries, explore the stuff
you're into, and get together.

1778
01:24:28,376 --> 01:24:36,859

1779
01:24:36,859 --> 01:24:38,356
-So everybody say hi.

1780
01:24:38,356 --> 01:24:39,853
That's the whole world.

1781
01:24:39,853 --> 01:24:41,103
-Hi.

1782
01:24:41,103 --> 01:24:44,344

1783
01:24:44,344 --> 01:24:45,342
-Can I hug you?

1784
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:46,592
-Yeah.

1785
01:24:46,592 --> 01:24:48,835

1786
01:24:48,835 --> 01:24:50,332
-We're the first ones that
are doing it like this.

1787
01:24:50,332 --> 01:24:51,330
It's history.

1788
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:53,825
-Look, you guys have the
greatest technology at your

1789
01:24:53,825 --> 01:24:56,320
fingertips.

1790
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,815
-We have a boy.

1791
01:24:58,815 --> 01:25:00,065
-Thanks, everybody.

1792
01:25:00,065 --> 01:25:07,797

1793
01:25:07,797 --> 01:25:08,795
-This a celebration.

1794
01:25:08,795 --> 01:25:10,791
Y'all is invited.

1795
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:14,783
[END VIDEO PLAY BACK]

1796
01:25:14,783 --> 01:25:19,790
[APPLAUSE]

1797
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:21,670
VIC GUNDOTRA: We are incredibly
grateful to the

1798
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:25,720
hundred and millions of you out
there who joined Google+

1799
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,020
in just under two short years.

1800
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:31,860
And we can think of no better
way to say thank you than to

1801
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:35,310
continue to innovate and to
build a product that people

1802
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:36,820
truly love.

1803
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:39,300
And so I'm here to show you
what's next with Google+.

1804
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:44,900
Today we're introducing 41 new
features across three major

1805
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:46,170
areas of Google+.

1806
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:52,460
First, a newly designed
stream, a new Hangout

1807
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:55,710
application, and a fundamentally
new photos

1808
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:57,010
experience.

1809
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:58,190
We have a lot to talk about.

1810
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:59,050
Let's get started.

1811
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:01,250
Let's begin with the Stream.

1812
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,760
Now, it's no surprise that
mobile devices are

1813
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,740
increasingly prevalent and
important in our lives.

1814
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:10,190
It's the computer that's
with us all the time.

1815
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:13,890
And so the Google+ has spent a
lot of time making sure that

1816
01:26:13,890 --> 01:26:19,050
that core stream experience on
mobile absolutely rocks.

1817
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:21,740
And the feedback has
been fantastic.

1818
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:25,140
And so today we're taking that
multicolumn design and

1819
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:27,720
bringing it to lots
more devices.

1820
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:31,420
Yes, from your phone to your
tablet and even your desktop,

1821
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:35,170
you're going to see a newly
designed stream.

1822
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:37,760
We're also fixing a longstanding
problem with

1823
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,700
today's social streams and
that's they're flat.

1824
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,820
It's very easy to see a long
list of things that have been

1825
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:48,720
shared with you, kind of like
a never ending newspaper.

1826
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:52,760
But it's nearly impossible to
go deeper on a topic or

1827
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,600
interest that you might have.

1828
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,410
And we think we can fix that.

1829
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:59,590
So this new design, this
new stream, is

1830
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:01,810
about design and depth.

1831
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:05,360
Maybe the best thing to
do is just show you.

1832
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,560
What you're looking
at is Google+ as

1833
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,680
it exists this morning.

1834
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,910
What you're going to see start
rolling out later today is the

1835
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:18,770
new Google+, which
looks like this.

1836
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:25,350
[APPLAUSE]

1837
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,190
VIC GUNDOTRA: You can see, we've
taken that multicolumn

1838
01:27:27,190 --> 01:27:29,890
design and brought it to the
desktop and really made

1839
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:31,670
something beautiful.

1840
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:34,200
It's dynamic, meaning depending
upon the size of

1841
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,730
your screen, it can either be
one column, two column, or

1842
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:37,820
three columns.

1843
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,910
And we've made sure to
give you choice.

1844
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:42,480
So if you go into the More menu,
you're always able to go

1845
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,870
to a single column if that's
what you prefer.

1846
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:49,830
Of course, in this multicolumn
design, we've made sure that

1847
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:53,890
posts like photos and videos
can span multiple columns.

1848
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:56,680
So you get something that's
truly immersive.

1849
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:00,330
And we made sure that it's
fast, fluid, and fun.

1850
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:02,250
And so we put delightful
animations

1851
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,490
throughout the product.

1852
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:07,400
For example, a share box that
animates out, menus that slide

1853
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,280
in and out to get out of the
way, and even cards and that

1854
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,410
flip and fade beautifully.

1855
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:14,902
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

1856
01:28:14,902 --> 01:28:20,250
[APPLAUSE]

1857
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:22,390
VIC GUNDOTRA: But it's not
just about the design.

1858
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:24,250
It's about depth.

1859
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:27,140
As I mentioned earlier, it's
very difficult to go deeper on

1860
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,810
a topic or interest
you care about.

1861
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:31,770
We think we've solved
this problem.

1862
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:35,660
And today we're introducing
related hashtags.

1863
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:38,930
What we'll do is we'll analyze
the content of a post.

1864
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:42,270
And Google will put on the
appropriate hashtag.

1865
01:28:42,270 --> 01:28:43,700
How does that work?

1866
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:44,850
Well, let's take a look.

1867
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:46,720
Here's a post about
the San Francisco

1868
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,310
Giants baseball team.

1869
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:49,920
It's not just about
the Giants.

1870
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,460
It's about Buster Posey, a
particular player, as well.

1871
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:57,230
And note in the top, we've
automatically tagged that post

1872
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:59,860
and we know it's about
those two topics.

1873
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:02,500
But that's only half
of the magic.

1874
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:06,950
We also then rank and
search the entire

1875
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:09,540
universe of Google+ content.

1876
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:12,090
And we rank it just for you.

1877
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:14,090
So when Matt clicks
on one of those

1878
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,750
hashtags, watch what happens.

1879
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:20,040
We flip the card over and we
then show you related items

1880
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,510
from the most important
sources and social

1881
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:23,310
proximity to you.

1882
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:24,702
Amazing, isn't it?

1883
01:29:24,702 --> 01:29:25,952
[APPLAUSE].

1884
01:29:25,952 --> 01:29:29,166

1885
01:29:29,166 --> 01:29:32,440
VIC GUNDOTRA: Now, if you think
that's impressive, let's

1886
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,730
take a look at another one
of these problems.

1887
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:37,470
In this case, one of the noted
photographers on our service

1888
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:39,740
has posted a picture
of Paris, and

1889
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,400
particularly the Eiffel Tower.

1890
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,610
Nowhere in his post or
in the comments is

1891
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:46,180
the word Eiffel Tower.

1892
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:49,920
But if you notice, Google has
automatically hashtaged this

1893
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,010
with the Eiffel Tower.

1894
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:53,150
How did we do that?

1895
01:29:53,150 --> 01:29:55,640
Well, we did image analysis
and combined with the

1896
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:56,460
Knowledge Graph that

1897
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,280
recognizes important landmarks.

1898
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:01,410
And Google knew that this was
about the Eiffel Tower.

1899
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:05,560
So if you click, why, you can
just go deeper and click

1900
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,850
through other posts about
the Eiffel Tower.

1901
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:13,240
[APPLAUSE]

1902
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,130
VIC GUNDOTRA: Now, of
course, we deeply

1903
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:17,130
respect the content producer.

1904
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:19,880
And so you always have the
option of telling Google,

1905
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:23,160
either on a particular post or
globally, whether you want

1906
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,020
your content to have
this amazing

1907
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,640
related hashtags feature.

1908
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:29,310
And if we ever get it wrong and
have the wrong hashtag,

1909
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:31,690
you could always X it out.

1910
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:35,140
In either case, we think what
we've built here is a stream

1911
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,700
that's about design and depth,
really allowing you to go

1912
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,550
deeper on your interests.

1913
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:42,750
Now, we don't have time to show
you all of the features.

1914
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:46,430

1915
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:48,420
There's just too many
to talk about today.

1916
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:51,030
But we'll be rolling this
out this afternoon.

1917
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:54,540
We hope that you'll absolutely
love it.

1918
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:59,010
OK, now let's talk
about Hangouts.

1919
01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:02,920
You know, at Google we have a
point of view about software

1920
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:06,990
and technology, namely that it
should get out of the way and

1921
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:09,320
allow people to do what
they do best, that's

1922
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:12,620
live, learn, and love.

1923
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:15,462
That was true even when
we started Google+.

1924
01:31:15,462 --> 01:31:18,570
You know, other sites when we
started often asked you to

1925
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:21,760
think of your relationships as
either friends or not friends.

1926
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:25,110
And we argued that was not
reflective of real life.

1927
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:26,660
In real life you don't
have this.

1928
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:28,160
You have this.

1929
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,690
And so we built circles as
a core part of Google+.

1930
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:34,090
And we're happy to report that
today more than half of all

1931
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:38,830
sharing that's done on Google+
is done to private circles.

1932
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:41,990
Now, that same dynamic exists
in the world of real time

1933
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:43,380
communications.

1934
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:45,500
When you think about a real time
communication, somebody

1935
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,770
you want to talk with, you don't
think about wanting to

1936
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:50,420
talk to a computer.

1937
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:52,580
You want to talk to a person.

1938
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:56,170
And yet despite 50 years
of work in real time

1939
01:31:56,170 --> 01:32:00,860
communication products, we still
are stuck with gadgets

1940
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:03,500
that get in the way.

1941
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,740
Think for a moment about
some of the real time

1942
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:09,370
communications products, the
choices that you have.

1943
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:11,210
Some are very nice.

1944
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:12,890
They work on one platform.

1945
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:15,600
So if you think about your
friend, you have to ask

1946
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,440
yourself are they on a
particular operating system?

1947
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,270
Why you should OS's matter?

1948
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:21,730
People matter.

1949
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:24,500
Or think about other choices
that are very popular on

1950
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,940
mobile, fantastic ways to
communicate on mobile.

1951
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:31,180
But if your brother is at work
on a desktop or a laptop, why

1952
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,750
should he be left out?

1953
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:36,240
Or there are other solutions
that do group video very, very

1954
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:37,900
well and messaging.

1955
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:40,500
But it's very difficult
to do photos.

1956
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:46,360
Frankly, even Google's own
services have been fragmented

1957
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,600
and confused at times.

1958
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,810
What we want to do is fill
in all the boxes.

1959
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:54,090
Because when we fill in all
the boxes, we believe,

1960
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:59,590
finally, technology can just go
away and people can focus

1961
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:02,260
on what makes them
the happiness.

1962
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:04,500
And that's just hanging out.

1963
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:08,140
So we're introducing today a
new application, Hangouts.

1964
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:10,560
And we think we've built
a product that is about

1965
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:15,100
conversations that last with
people that you love.

1966
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:16,990
Let me show you the product.

1967
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:19,890
Now, as Matt goes to the demo
here, the first thing you'll

1968
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:22,850
notice on Matt's Android
phone is the new icon,

1969
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:25,330
a standalone app.

1970
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:27,680
And Matt will go ahead and click
on Hangouts and open up

1971
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,010
the application.

1972
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:31,200
Now, you're looking
here at a list of

1973
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:35,080
conversations, not contacts.

1974
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,340
Some of those conversations
or one on one.

1975
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,880
Some of those conversations
are group conversations.

1976
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,520
But the primary pivot,
the focus is on those

1977
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,590
conversations.

1978
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:46,580
Now, if Matt wants to get his
contacts, maybe he wants to

1979
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:48,890
add someone, it's
one tap away.

1980
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:51,590
You can see Google will rank the
important people that he

1981
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:54,370
normally talks to and make
that easily available for

1982
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:56,100
either a message or
a video call.

1983
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,060
But let's go back to
the conversations.

1984
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:01,250
There's several attributes about
these conversations that

1985
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:02,360
I want to talk about.

1986
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:04,170
The first is my favorite.

1987
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:04,860
And that is these

1988
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:07,610
conversations can be long lasting.

1989
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:11,290
So as Matt goes back in time,
you're able to see that

1990
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:13,160
conversation.

1991
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,120
Imagine that you have your
family in a conversation for

1992
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,750
many months or a year.

1993
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,530
There's the holiday party.

1994
01:34:18,530 --> 01:34:20,500
There's the vacation
you took together.

1995
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:24,170
There's important moments like
the birth of a child.

1996
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:27,980
All those things are stored with
you even as you change

1997
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:30,910
devices in those long running
conversations.

1998
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:33,510
Of course, we give you the
ability to turn off history.

1999
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:34,990
Of course, we give you
the ability to

2000
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:36,520
delete those things.

2001
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,960
But having the ability to save
those conversations is, I

2002
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,130
think, delightful and amazing.

2003
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:43,880
Another aspect is that
the conversations

2004
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,770
are rich and alive.

2005
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:47,970
Your photos are stored
in albums.

2006
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:49,040
This is amazing.

2007
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,880
This baby's not even three
months old and he's already

2008
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,720
learned how to face pump.

2009
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:57,250
But all the images that you've
shared as a family are all

2010
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:58,680
right there.

2011
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,140
In addition to beautiful images
that are easily stored

2012
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:04,410
and saved, the conversation
feels alive.

2013
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:05,740
Look at the bottom.

2014
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:08,890
You can there see as people
join, they show up.

2015
01:35:08,890 --> 01:35:11,530
As they're typing,
they animate out.

2016
01:35:11,530 --> 01:35:14,580
You can see exactly where
someone has read to.

2017
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:18,240
It really feels like you're
in the same room together.

2018
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:21,830
And we think that's
delightful.

2019
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:23,990
By the way, you're looking at
it on the way web, you're

2020
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:27,130
looking at it on Android, and
you're looking at it on iOS,

2021
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:29,030
all available today.

2022
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:38,160
[APPLAUSE]

2023
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:39,620
VIC GUNDOTRA: And, by the
way, two other points.

2024
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:41,380
One is a point that Hugo made.

2025
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:42,830
I think you're going
to love how the

2026
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:44,790
notifications are all synced.

2027
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:48,180
So if you wipe a notification
from the desktop or on

2028
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:50,150
Android, it'll go away
on another device.

2029
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:51,190
It's beautiful.

2030
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:52,300
I think you'll like that.

2031
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:54,180
But my favorite feature &mdash;

2032
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,190
sorry about that.

2033
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:56,970
Let's go back to the demo.

2034
01:35:56,970 --> 01:35:59,160
One other feature I didn't talk
about that was pretty

2035
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:02,280
critical, which is at Google
we always believed that the

2036
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:04,920
best way to do real time
communications is

2037
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,150
face to face to face.

2038
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:09,960
And so in that conversation,
Matt can tap on that video

2039
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:13,800
icon and everyone in that
conversation will be dropped

2040
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,160
into a video chat.

2041
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,410
There, you can see Matt.

2042
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:18,980
He's into the video chat and
everyone's being dropped in.

2043
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:21,570
Group video at no charge.

2044
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:23,165
Isn't that fantastic?

2045
01:36:23,165 --> 01:36:30,620
[APPLAUSE]

2046
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:31,870
VIC GUNDOTRA: OK, let's
go back to the slides.

2047
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:38,540

2048
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:40,350
OK, now let's switch topics.

2049
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:43,870
And, finally, let's
talk about photos.

2050
01:36:43,870 --> 01:36:48,100
Photography can be a very
rewarding experience.

2051
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,460
I know for me it captures
the most important

2052
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:52,020
moments of my life.

2053
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:54,570
I remember when I was on the
beach and I asked my kids to

2054
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:56,630
stand together to
take a picture.

2055
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:58,460
I didn't know my son was
going to wrap his

2056
01:36:58,460 --> 01:36:59,630
arms around my daughter.

2057
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:01,170
I didn't know my daughter
was going to reach up

2058
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:02,440
and hold his hand.

2059
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:06,130
But for the rest of my life I'm
going to picture them like

2060
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:09,110
this despite the fact that
he's now taller than me.

2061
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:11,800
That's how I imagine him.

2062
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,190
I'm not alone.

2063
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:16,890
You too have amazing images that
are the most important

2064
01:37:16,890 --> 01:37:19,620
precious memories
of your life.

2065
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:22,900
But if we're honest with each
other, we'll also admit that

2066
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:26,150
photography is very
labor intensive.

2067
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:30,370
It takes a lot of time to
organize, edit, enhance,

2068
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:33,640
upload and share your
photos, time that

2069
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:36,406
many of us don't have.

2070
01:37:36,406 --> 01:37:41,270
At Google we think we can give
you some of your time back.

2071
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:45,580
By combining your camera with
our cloud, we can do some of

2072
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:49,820
those labor intensive tasks
automatically for you.

2073
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:53,540
In fact, today we'd like to
introduce the notion of

2074
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:56,890
Google's data centers being
your new darkroom.

2075
01:37:56,890 --> 01:37:58,880
Now, what does that mean?

2076
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,170
Well, when you think of
the cloud, most of us

2077
01:38:01,170 --> 01:38:03,220
think of back up.

2078
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:05,620
But today we're going to go
beyond back up, and we're

2079
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:08,870
going to talk about three
exciting new areas that

2080
01:38:08,870 --> 01:38:11,940
combine the data center,
Google's cloud, with

2081
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:13,090
photography.

2082
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:15,520
But before I do that, let me
just begin with what you

2083
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,540
already know, back up.

2084
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:20,700
Now, since we've launched
Google+, we've always backed

2085
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:24,920
up your photos, unlimited, all
your photos at standard size.

2086
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:27,570
And a few months ago we
introduced the ability for you

2087
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:30,670
to choose an option where we
would upload your photos, not

2088
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:33,220
at standard size, but
at full resolution.

2089
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:35,300
And we offered 5
gigabytes free.

2090
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:38,220
This week we announced that
we're going from 5 gigabytes

2091
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:44,310
to 15 gigabytes free.

2092
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:48,150
Now, why does full resolution
matter?

2093
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:49,540
Well, what you're looking
at here is an

2094
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:52,310
eight megapixel shot.

2095
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:54,420
An eight megapixel shot &mdash;

2096
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:55,916
you can clap if you
want, go ahead.

2097
01:38:55,916 --> 01:39:02,370
[APPLAUSE]

2098
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:04,120
VIC GUNDOTRA: I love it when
you clap and I haven't even

2099
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:05,430
made the point on the slide.

2100
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:06,440
That's great.

2101
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:08,210
But I think you get it.

2102
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:10,360
Eight megapixels is
pretty common.

2103
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:13,980
Some cell phones like the
Galaxy S4 go up to 13

2104
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:15,030
megapixels.

2105
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:18,900
And when you have an important
image, you don't want 619

2106
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,740
pixels or 1024 or 2048.

2107
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:25,300
80 You want all the pixels
because some memories are not

2108
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,030
meant to be downsized.

2109
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:28,750
And we give you that
ability on Google+.

2110
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:32,390
Let's move on.

2111
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:34,860
Now let's talk about
Highlight.

2112
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:39,070
What you're looking at is 686 of
my vacation photos from my

2113
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:41,090
trip to New Zealand.

2114
01:39:41,090 --> 01:39:43,340
Now, there are some beautiful
images in there,

2115
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:45,030
images I want to share.

2116
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:47,730
But I don't have time to
pick them out because

2117
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:49,925
my vacation is over.

2118
01:39:49,925 --> 01:39:52,040
[LAUGHTER]

2119
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:56,290
VIC GUNDOTRA: Now, I suspect
you've been in the same boat.

2120
01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:59,460
It takes time do
all this stuff.

2121
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:02,650
Google can pick the best
pictures for you.

2122
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:06,500
We can go from these 686
pictures to these.

2123
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:09,170
It's remarkably accurate.

2124
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:09,760
Go ahead.

2125
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:10,990
You can clap.

2126
01:40:10,990 --> 01:40:14,490
[APPLAUSE]

2127
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:16,820
VIC GUNDOTRA: Some of you must
be saying, how did Google know

2128
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:17,940
those were the best?

2129
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,210
Let me tell you.

2130
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:21,420
We do lots of things
to choose the best.

2131
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:23,250
Some of things that we
do is we look for

2132
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,420
images that are blurry.

2133
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:26,180
And they're not going to
make the highlights.

2134
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:28,380
We look for images that
are duplicates.

2135
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:30,440
I took four images of
the same mountain.

2136
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:31,470
We'll pick one.

2137
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:34,620
We look for images that are not
the greatest exposure and

2138
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:36,550
they're unlikely to make
your highlights.

2139
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:39,140
Or we even do amazing
things like we

2140
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:40,730
recognize the Eiffel Tower.

2141
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:43,240
We can recognize in your
images if you're at an

2142
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:44,540
important landmark.

2143
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:47,380
In this case, this is a
beautiful shot of Queenstown.

2144
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:50,290
And we boost that image so that
it's more likely to make

2145
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:51,370
the highlights.

2146
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:53,670
We also analyze to see if
there are people there.

2147
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:55,100
Are the people happy?

2148
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:56,490
Are they smiling?

2149
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:59,210
Might make the highlights.

2150
01:40:59,210 --> 01:41:01,920
Our machine learning algorithms
have also been

2151
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:06,050
trained by literally hundreds
of human raters so that the

2152
01:41:06,050 --> 01:41:09,340
machine learning algorithms have
now begun to account for

2153
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:11,070
aesthetics, for human taste.

2154
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:13,410
What do people find beautiful?

2155
01:41:13,410 --> 01:41:15,180
And we're able to boost
that image.

2156
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:17,290
And then my favorite
is affinity.

2157
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:20,560
We recognize who's important
to you, who's

2158
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,950
in your family circle.

2159
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:24,660
And we apply appropriate social
boost so that you're

2160
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:27,170
wife and your children are
in the highlights.

2161
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:29,120
It's absolutely amazing.

2162
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,470
We think you're going
to love it.

2163
01:41:31,470 --> 01:41:32,998
And it's going to
save you time.

2164
01:41:32,998 --> 01:41:41,310
[APPLAUSE]

2165
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:42,500
VIC GUNDOTRA: This is
a shot of what we're

2166
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:43,670
rolling out this evening.

2167
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:45,610
This is the actual product,
the desktop version.

2168
01:41:45,610 --> 01:41:47,360
You'll note that we'll give
you your highlights.

2169
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:50,490
And right there at the bottom
you could always click and see

2170
01:41:50,490 --> 01:41:52,670
all the other images as well.

2171
01:41:52,670 --> 01:41:54,600
So it's right there for you.

2172
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:59,180
Now let's talk about enhancing
your images.

2173
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:01,460
One of my favorite photographers
famously said,

2174
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:02,850
you don't take a photograph.

2175
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:04,050
You make it.

2176
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:06,080
And if you know a good
photographer, a professional,

2177
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,070
you know that's true.

2178
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:11,700
Professionals can take a good
image and make it amazing

2179
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:15,580
because they have access to
tools like this, powerful

2180
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:19,230
tools that require lots of
skills that run on expensive

2181
01:42:19,230 --> 01:42:22,010
machines that take
lots of time.

2182
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:24,060
And you can do amazing things.

2183
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:27,340
The problem is is that for the
average person these tools

2184
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:31,210
often look like this to them,
like a bewildering set of

2185
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:33,300
knobs that they don't
understand.

2186
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:37,170
Today we're introducing
auto enhance.

2187
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:39,930
Auto enhance is an easy
button to make your

2188
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:42,560
memories look beautiful.

2189
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,840
We can automatically take an
image that looks like this and

2190
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,320
make it look like this.

2191
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,480
Now, how in the world
do we do that?

2192
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,010
Well, we're going to show you
some of the things that we do,

2193
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:56,770
things like tonal distribution,
skin softening,

2194
01:42:56,770 --> 01:43:00,510
noise reduction, structure,
vignetting, red eye reduction,

2195
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:02,360
so much that we do.

2196
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:03,900
And we don't have time
in his keynote to

2197
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,020
show you all of them.

2198
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:06,290
But we're going to
highlight a few.

2199
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:08,270
Let's begin with tonal
distribution.

2200
01:43:08,270 --> 01:43:09,740
All of us have taken
pictures that are

2201
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:12,100
over or under exposed.

2202
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:14,870
You might think Google would
find the middle ground.

2203
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:16,200
We do better than that.

2204
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:19,360
Remember, our algorithms take
into account human taste.

2205
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:24,110
So we can take an image like
this and just make it perfect.

2206
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:26,530
Let me show you another
example.

2207
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:27,870
Let me show you another
example.

2208
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:29,310
Let's talk about
skin softening.

2209
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:31,300
Now, I'm going to apologize in
advance because you're going

2210
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:33,180
to see a huge photo of me.

2211
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:35,110
But we thought we'd pick someone
that no one could get

2212
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:36,130
offended over.

2213
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:38,440
So we'll start that with me.

2214
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:43,850
OK, now let's talk about
recognizing people's faces.

2215
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:48,020
If you have an inexpensive phone
or even an inexpensive

2216
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:51,230
camera, those devices
can recognize faces.

2217
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:54,230
But the state of the art today
is to put a rectangle around a

2218
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:56,560
face and say, we think
there's a face there.

2219
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:58,850
We've had several breakthroughs
at Google where

2220
01:43:58,850 --> 01:44:01,470
we're now able to deeply
recognize the

2221
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:03,430
human face and skin.

2222
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:06,340
We can tease apart exactly
where is the hairline.

2223
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:07,890
What are the eyes, the teeth?

2224
01:44:07,890 --> 01:44:09,400
Is the person wearing jewelry?

2225
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:10,690
Do they have glasses on?

2226
01:44:10,690 --> 01:44:13,010
And we can separate
all that out.

2227
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:16,540
That breakthrough means that
when we do the other effects,

2228
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:20,400
things like structure, tonal
enhancement, we can do

2229
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,140
something different
on the clouds,

2230
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:24,140
the water, the mountains.

2231
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:26,830
And we can treat the human face
completely separately

2232
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:30,130
like a professional
would in a tool.

2233
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:31,710
Now, let's talk about one
of those effects.

2234
01:44:31,710 --> 01:44:33,280
Let's talk about
skin softening.

2235
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,030
Now, how many of you like your
passport or your driver's

2236
01:44:36,030 --> 01:44:37,690
license photos?

2237
01:44:37,690 --> 01:44:38,600
No one does.

2238
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:40,310
Well, why not?

2239
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:44,180
Because photographs often
exaggerate our flaws.

2240
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:47,440
In real life when you look at me
or your friends, you don't

2241
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,110
see every one of their flaws.

2242
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:51,940
But in a picture, you
see all of them.

2243
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:53,590
In fact, we're going
to make it worse.

2244
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:57,560
Let's zoom in on this picture
a little bit.

2245
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:01,540
Like I said, I used my own so I
wouldn't offend anyone else.

2246
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,020
Wrinkles, right?

2247
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:04,700
But chances are when you're
talking to me, you

2248
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:05,580
don't stare at them.

2249
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:09,520
Watch what happens when we apply
skin softening, just

2250
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,830
gently toned down.

2251
01:45:10,830 --> 01:45:11,870
Let's zoom all the way out.

2252
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:13,440
That's the original image.

2253
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:16,140
That's with skin softening
enhancements.

2254
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:19,270
Just gently and beautifully
enhanced.

2255
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:21,980
We think you're going to love
it when we apply this across

2256
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:23,360
your photographs.

2257
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,690
Let's talk about noise
reduction.

2258
01:45:25,690 --> 01:45:29,150
Maybe you've taken a picture
in low light, particularly

2259
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:30,560
with a cell phone.

2260
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,270
You get grain, noise
on your image.

2261
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:35,620
Look at the sky in
this photograph.

2262
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:38,220
Well, our noise reduction
filters can automatically take

2263
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:43,220
something that looks like this
and make it look like that.

2264
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:44,080
Pretty amazing.

2265
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,650
[APPLAUSE]

2266
01:45:47,650 --> 01:45:48,770
Let's talk about structure.

2267
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:52,550
Here's a picture that I took
when I was in New Zealand.

2268
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:54,680
I remember that image
having more life.

2269
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,670
It was more vivid.

2270
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:56,680
Well, what happened?

2271
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:59,290
Well, the camera palette
balanced everything out so it

2272
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:00,650
became flat.

2273
01:46:00,650 --> 01:46:03,340
A professional would go into a
tool and they would add a lot

2274
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:05,130
more structure to the sky.

2275
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:06,740
We can do that automatically.

2276
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:09,390
And so we can take an image that
looks like this and auto

2277
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:11,591
enhance it to look like that.

2278
01:46:11,591 --> 01:46:14,680
[APPLAUSE]

2279
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:17,020
VIC GUNDOTRA: There's obviously
lots more that we

2280
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:18,180
don't have time to talk about.

2281
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:20,200
But what we're going to
bring up a special

2282
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:21,790
tool, a debugging tool.

2283
01:46:21,790 --> 01:46:24,380
And we're going to tease apart
some of these effects and show

2284
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:27,540
you how they layer on to
make an image awesome.

2285
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:32,060
So here's an image, untouched
out of the camera.

2286
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:33,590
And we're going to start
layering on these

2287
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:34,480
enhancements.

2288
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,770
Let's begin with tonal
enhancement.

2289
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:40,190
Let's add some skin softening.

2290
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:42,780
Before and after on the
skin softening.

2291
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:45,690
Now let's add some structure
for the clouds.

2292
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:48,660
Let's add vignette to emphasize
the human face.

2293
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:52,820
And let's go before and then
auto enhanced by Google.

2294
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:54,282
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

2295
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:58,100
[APPLAUSE]

2296
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:00,430
VIC GUNDOTRA: One
more example.

2297
01:47:00,430 --> 01:47:02,710
A beautiful landscape
photograph of

2298
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:04,330
Queenstown that I took.

2299
01:47:04,330 --> 01:47:05,530
I think it's pretty great.

2300
01:47:05,530 --> 01:47:07,070
Let's see what Google can do.

2301
01:47:07,070 --> 01:47:09,120
Once again, tonal enhancement.

2302
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:10,710
Doesn't need any skin
softening here.

2303
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:11,650
Structure.

2304
01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:13,290
A little bit around the edges.

2305
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:14,270
Darken the edges.

2306
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:17,690
Look at the original and
what Google did.

2307
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:18,656
Amazing.

2308
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:22,550
[APPLAUSE]

2309
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:25,330
VIC GUNDOTRA: All you have to
do is upload your images and

2310
01:47:25,330 --> 01:47:29,690
we will apply all of this for
you on all of your photographs

2311
01:47:29,690 --> 01:47:31,820
while still giving
you control.

2312
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:35,130
This is an actual picture or an
actual shot of the product

2313
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:37,380
itself that's rolling
out this afternoon.

2314
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:40,670
If you mouse over any photograph
that's yours, we'll

2315
01:47:40,670 --> 01:47:42,640
show you that enhanced icon.

2316
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:45,520
And when Matt clicks on that
enhanced icon, we'll go back

2317
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,470
to the original.

2318
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:48,730
And if you let go, you'll
see the enhancement.

2319
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:51,390
And if you want, you can click
under the More menu, and you

2320
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:55,810
can always turn this on or off,
either globally or on an

2321
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:57,670
individual photograph.

2322
01:47:57,670 --> 01:48:00,900
So we think this is amazing,
and it's going to save you

2323
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:02,040
lots of time.

2324
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:05,200
Let's continue on.

2325
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:06,930
We've talked about backup.

2326
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:10,480
We've talked about enhancing,
highlighting your photos and

2327
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,630
enhancing your photos.

2328
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:13,890
Now let's talk about awesome.

2329
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:17,600
Auto awesome creates a
new image from one

2330
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,960
that did not exist.

2331
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:21,600
Let me give you an example.

2332
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:22,310
We have lots of these.

2333
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:23,560
Let me give you an example.

2334
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:27,170
We recognize that you've taken
several pictures in burst mode

2335
01:48:27,170 --> 01:48:29,100
or taken around the same
time together.

2336
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:33,320
We will automatically gift to
you in your album something

2337
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:36,730
that looks like this.

2338
01:48:36,730 --> 01:48:41,650
[LAUGHTER]

2339
01:48:41,650 --> 01:48:46,080
[APPLAUSE]

2340
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:47,070
VIC GUNDOTRA: Here's
another example.

2341
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:49,050
Maybe you've taken lots
of shots of children.

2342
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:51,020
They're never looking
at the same time.

2343
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:52,090
Go back to your album.

2344
01:48:52,090 --> 01:48:53,580
You'll see a gift for you.

2345
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:55,700
You'll have another one of these
auto awesome motions.

2346
01:48:55,700 --> 01:49:00,010

2347
01:49:00,010 --> 01:49:03,150
By the way, over the past two
weeks in a dark launch state,

2348
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:06,150
we've gone through all the
albums you've hosted on Google

2349
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:07,820
and gifted all of
these to you.

2350
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:11,250
You'll see them turned
on this afternoon.

2351
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:11,940
These are five &mdash;

2352
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:16,540
[APPLAUSE]

2353
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:18,650
VIC GUNDOTRA: We're introducing
five auto awesome

2354
01:49:18,650 --> 01:49:19,580
effects today.

2355
01:49:19,580 --> 01:49:21,750
You saw a demonstration
of motion.

2356
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:23,710
Let me briefly talk
about the others.

2357
01:49:23,710 --> 01:49:26,730
If we recognize that you have
multiple portraits together of

2358
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:30,090
people, we will automatically
create a collage.

2359
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:31,740
HDR is self explanatory.

2360
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:33,050
We'll do that for you.

2361
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:37,130
If we see multiple pictures of
the same people in burst moder

2362
01:49:37,130 --> 01:49:39,700
where they're not all smiling,
we will find where they're

2363
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:42,420
smiling and we will construct
a new image

2364
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:43,980
with all of them smiling.

2365
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:44,610
It's amazing.

2366
01:49:44,610 --> 01:49:47,320
[APPLAUSE]

2367
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:49,210
VIC GUNDOTRA: And,
finally, a pano.

2368
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:51,870
So if you've taken an image, we
recognize it's at the same

2369
01:49:51,870 --> 01:49:55,260
spot, we'll stitch them together
beautifully and put

2370
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:57,160
that in your album for free.

2371
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:02,740
OK, so to summarize, today we've
shown you a new, modern,

2372
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:06,750
multicolumn stream, a stream
that's about design and depth

2373
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:09,350
so you can explore your
interests on Google+.

2374
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:14,110
We've shown you a new Hangouts
application, one that's about

2375
01:50:14,110 --> 01:50:17,370
conversations that lasts with
the people you love.

2376
01:50:17,370 --> 01:50:20,500
And, finally, we've shown you
a new photos experience and

2377
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:24,740
shown you what can happen when
Google is your darkroom.

2378
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:27,870
Taken collectively, we
think we just put

2379
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:29,070
the Google into Google+.

2380
01:50:29,070 --> 01:50:33,100
And we've finally allowed
technology to get out of the

2381
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:37,920
way and allow you to do what you
do best, live, learn, and,

2382
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,600
yes, even love.

2383
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,612
Thank you.

2384
01:50:40,612 --> 01:50:49,780
[APPLAUSE]

2385
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:52,840
VIC GUNDOTRA: Now we'd like to
talk about what was possibly

2386
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,360
your first Google
love, Search.

2387
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:58,170
Join me in welcoming Ahmit
Singhal to the stage.

2388
01:50:58,170 --> 01:50:59,148
Thank you.

2389
01:50:59,148 --> 01:51:04,038
[APPLAUSE]

2390
01:51:04,038 --> 01:51:10,395
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2391
01:51:10,395 --> 01:51:18,776

2392
01:51:18,776 --> 01:51:20,710
AMIT SINGHAL: Yes.

2393
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:23,420
It's a provocative
title, indeed,

2394
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:26,100
especially coming from Google.

2395
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:30,100
But I believe with
good reason.

2396
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,780
Search is dramatically changing

2397
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:33,770
right before our eyes.

2398
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:37,360
And in the next 15 minutes,
I want to show you

2399
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:41,550
how and in fact why.

2400
01:51:41,550 --> 01:51:45,140
But before we dive in, let me
just tell you why I'm so

2401
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:47,750
excited to be here.

2402
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:50,120
I grew up in small
town India in the

2403
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:51,832
foothills of the Himalayas.

2404
01:51:51,832 --> 01:51:56,080
[CHEERING]

2405
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:57,330
AMIT SINGHAL: Thank you.

2406
01:51:57,330 --> 01:51:59,450

2407
01:51:59,450 --> 01:52:03,100
And, yes, that's me
when I was three.

2408
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:04,350
Very cute.

2409
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:06,610

2410
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:11,425
Indeed, my friends asked
me too, what happened?

2411
01:52:11,425 --> 01:52:15,980

2412
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:19,620
Growing up, like many of you,
I was hooked on Star Trek.

2413
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:23,580
I would watch endless episodes
of Star Trek, captivated by

2414
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:25,680
the future technology
it showed.

2415
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:29,490
I mean, a computer you could
talk to and it will answer

2416
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:32,070
everything you ask it?

2417
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:35,260
I dreamt of building that
computer one day.

2418
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:38,320
And little did I know that I
would grow up to become the

2419
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:41,650
person responsible for building
my dream for the

2420
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:43,170
entire world.

2421
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:49,060
[APPLAUSE]

2422
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:50,700
AMIT SINGHAL: Now, at Google
we are building three

2423
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:54,720
experiences that are making huge
advances towards building

2424
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,630
that dream.

2425
01:52:56,630 --> 01:53:02,010
The search of future will need
to answer, converse, and

2426
01:53:02,010 --> 01:53:03,590
anticipate.

2427
01:53:03,590 --> 01:53:05,610
And today we have announcements

2428
01:53:05,610 --> 01:53:08,650
across all these areas.

2429
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:09,910
So let's start answers.

2430
01:53:09,910 --> 01:53:14,320
And let me show you what we
have been up to recently.

2431
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:18,020
Last year, when we launched the
Knowledge Graph, it was a

2432
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:22,000
huge advance in search
technology.

2433
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,030
Knowledge Graph enabled Google
to move beyond keywords and

2434
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:31,240
understand real wold entities,
unique people, places, and

2435
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:35,350
things, and the relationships
between them.

2436
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:38,680
Knowledge graph allowed us to
answer questions we couldn't

2437
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:44,150
have answered before like what
are the movies by J.J Abrams?

2438
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:48,750
Or what's the release date of
one of the most anticipated

2439
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:51,590
movies of the season?

2440
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:55,060
Now, we have been continuously
improving the Knowledge Graph.

2441
01:53:55,060 --> 01:54:00,280
With over 570 million entities
and growing, the graph becomes

2442
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:03,440
more and more powerful
each day.

2443
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:07,330
And today I am happy to announce
that very soon you

2444
01:54:07,330 --> 01:54:10,290
will start getting important
statistics powered by the

2445
01:54:10,290 --> 01:54:12,110
Knowledge Graph.

2446
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:14,680
Now you can already find answers
to questions like

2447
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:16,980
what's the population
of India.

2448
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:21,620
However, starting today, we will
be anticipating your next

2449
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:24,990
question, which may very well
be, how does it compare to the

2450
01:54:24,990 --> 01:54:27,770
population of other countries?

2451
01:54:27,770 --> 01:54:31,990
And not only will we give you
the answer alongside the trend

2452
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:37,210
line, we will show you all that
in comparison to China

2453
01:54:37,210 --> 01:54:42,330
and the United States, the two
countries who are most often

2454
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:46,660
compared to India
population wise.

2455
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:49,500
Now, we have launched Knowledge
Graph in English and

2456
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,310
eight other languages.

2457
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:54,825
And today we are
adding Polish &mdash;

2458
01:54:54,825 --> 01:54:56,700
[APPLAUSE]

2459
01:54:56,700 --> 01:55:00,050
AMIT SINGHAL: Yes, my friends.

2460
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:09,160
Turkish, simplified Chinese, and
traditional Chinese as new

2461
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:12,060
languages for the
Knowledge Graph.

2462
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:16,050
And while we are incredibly
excited about our progress

2463
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:18,330
here, we're just getting
started.

2464
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:22,310
And we know we can do a whole
lot better because sometimes

2465
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:25,760
the answer you're looking for
is that song or that video

2466
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:29,480
that your friend may have sent
you or it's your upcoming

2467
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:32,160
flight or restaurant
reservation.

2468
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:35,710
And you should be able to find
those answers from your own

2469
01:55:35,710 --> 01:55:39,240
world without having to dig and
sift through your email,

2470
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:41,520
your documents, and
your calendar.

2471
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:46,970
You should simply be able to ask
Google for your upcoming

2472
01:55:46,970 --> 01:55:57,950
flight or your trip plans,
even your restaurant

2473
01:55:57,950 --> 01:56:04,050
reservations or the package
that's about to arrive, and

2474
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:08,700
even, of course, your
vacation photos.

2475
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:11,970
Now, people who have opted in
to over Gmail search field

2476
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:16,380
trial are already enjoying
this powerful experience.

2477
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:20,910
However, something that is as
important as giving you the

2478
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:24,720
answers and giving them to you
in the most natural way

2479
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:34,220
possible is so that you can
pretty much ask Google like

2480
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:37,930
you would ask a friend and not
by having to type keywords

2481
01:56:37,930 --> 01:56:40,220
into a search box.

2482
01:56:40,220 --> 01:56:42,930
This is why we have been working
hard on technologies

2483
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:45,440
like voice recognition
and natural language

2484
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,680
understanding.

2485
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:50,120
Now, we have already launched
conversational search on

2486
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:52,830
Android and on iOS platform.

2487
01:56:52,830 --> 01:56:56,720
You can tape the mic, ask Google
your question, and you

2488
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:59,220
can get a spoken
response back.

2489
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:03,960
And today, for the first time,
I'm happy to announce that all

2490
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:07,060
this goodness of conversational
search will be

2491
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:11,027
coming to all your desktops and
laptops through Chrome.

2492
01:57:11,027 --> 01:57:17,500
[APPLAUSE]

2493
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:19,540
AMIT SINGHAL: While you can
already use the microphone in

2494
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:24,650
Chrome to search, we will be
bringing conversational search

2495
01:57:24,650 --> 01:57:31,030
and hot wording, a new
interface, or as I call it, no

2496
01:57:31,030 --> 01:57:34,350
interface so that you
don't even have to

2497
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:35,960
click the mic to search.

2498
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:40,970
You can sit back, relax,
say OK, Google &mdash;

2499
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:44,330
[LAUGHTER]

2500
01:57:44,330 --> 01:57:49,140
[APPLAUSE]

2501
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:52,630
AMIT SINGHAL: Ask your question
and have Google speak

2502
01:57:52,630 --> 01:57:55,510
back the answer.

2503
01:57:55,510 --> 01:57:58,930
So we talked about the power of
building these new powerful

2504
01:57:58,930 --> 01:58:02,060
experiences to answer your
questions and letting them ask

2505
01:58:02,060 --> 01:58:05,130
you in the most natural
way possible.

2506
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:09,630
However, we think that another
essential experience is our

2507
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:14,250
ability to anticipate and
suggest to you the right thing

2508
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:19,550
at the right time even before
you ask for them.

2509
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:23,770
Here, of course, I'm talking
about Google Now.

2510
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:27,030
Google Now was launched
for Android last year.

2511
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:31,270
And within a short amount of
time, it has become a must

2512
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:33,660
have for its users.

2513
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:36,830
Recently we launched Google
Now for iPhones and iPads

2514
01:58:36,830 --> 01:58:41,210
through the Google Search app,
and users are loving it.

2515
01:58:41,210 --> 01:58:43,780
It's getting better and
better by the day.

2516
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:46,720
And the more you use
it, the more useful

2517
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:49,420
it becomes for you.

2518
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:53,800
And today we are happy to
announce that very soon you

2519
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:57,990
will be able to set reminders
for yourself in Google Now and

2520
01:58:57,990 --> 01:59:01,920
they will show up at the right
place at the right time

2521
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:03,364
whenever you need them.

2522
01:59:03,364 --> 01:59:08,940
[APPLAUSE]

2523
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:11,640
AMIT SINGHAL: In addition, we're
also launching public

2524
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:16,190
transit commute time cards
and more cards for music,

2525
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:19,150
television, TV shows,
and video games you

2526
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:20,600
are interested in.

2527
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:24,040
Now, we are confident that all
this momentum in Google Now

2528
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:28,470
will make Google even more
useful as an assistive tool.

2529
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:30,720
And we are very excited
about it.

2530
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:34,160
But what we are really excited
about is how all these

2531
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:36,250
experiences are coming
together to

2532
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:38,260
make your life easy.

2533
01:59:38,260 --> 01:59:41,100
And the best way to understand
this is to

2534
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:44,150
actually see them in action.

2535
01:59:44,150 --> 01:59:47,670
I'd now like to invite Johanna
Wright on the stage to show

2536
01:59:47,670 --> 01:59:50,760
you how all these experiences
are coming together in a

2537
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:52,092
beautiful way.

2538
01:59:52,092 --> 02:00:04,910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2539
02:00:04,910 --> 02:00:06,040
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Thank
you, Amit.

2540
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:09,090
I'm so excited to be here to
bring to life what Amit was

2541
02:00:09,090 --> 02:00:10,420
talking about.

2542
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:12,250
Let's start with a scenario
that might happen in my

2543
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:14,850
family, planning a day trip
to Santa Cruz with

2544
02:00:14,850 --> 02:00:17,450
my husband and kids.

2545
02:00:17,450 --> 02:00:19,780
I'm going to walk over
to the computer here.

2546
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:22,120
And what you see here
is a Chrome browser

2547
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:23,640
in full screen mode.

2548
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:26,280
And Amit was talking
about hot wording.

2549
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:27,860
Now, this is really hot.

2550
02:00:27,860 --> 02:00:30,010
We just took it off the
press this morning.

2551
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:32,970
And I've actually never tried
hot wording in a room with so

2552
02:00:32,970 --> 02:00:35,820
much ambient noise.

2553
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:37,640
So no hands.

2554
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:39,730
OK, Google.

2555
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:43,720
Show me things to do
in Santa Cruz.

2556
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:46,976
FEMALE VOICE: Here are popular
attractions in Santa Cruz.

02:00:46,976 --> 02:00:53,450

2558
02:00:53,450 --> 02:00:54,910
JOHANNA WRIGHT: What you see
here is coming from our

2559
02:00:54,910 --> 02:00:55,870
Knowledge Graph.

2560
02:00:55,870 --> 02:00:58,980
The Knowledge Graph knows the
Santa Cruz is a place and that

2561
02:00:58,980 --> 02:01:02,260
this list of places are
related to Santa Cruz.

2562
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:03,870
I like the Natural Bridges
State Beach.

2563
02:01:03,870 --> 02:01:06,300
It's a nice place to relax
with my family.

2564
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:08,270
But I kind of like something
more active.

2565
02:01:08,270 --> 02:01:10,320
What about the boardwalk?

2566
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:12,010
OK, Google.

2567
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:13,995
Show me pictures of the
Santa Cruz Boardwalk.

2568
02:01:13,995 --> 02:01:16,530

2569
02:01:16,530 --> 02:01:18,730
FEMALE VOICE: Here you go, some
pictures related to the

2570
02:01:18,730 --> 02:01:21,332
Santa Cruz Boardwalk.

2571
02:01:21,332 --> 02:01:27,650
[APPLAUSE]

2572
02:01:27,650 --> 02:01:28,380
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Nice.

2573
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:30,060
I love a wooden roller
coaster.

2574
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:31,310
So does my husband.

2575
02:01:31,310 --> 02:01:33,250
It'd be nice to see if
our kids like it too.

2576
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:36,980
The only question is will
the drive be too long?

2577
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:38,640
OK, Google.

2578
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:42,070
How far is it from here?

2579
02:01:42,070 --> 02:01:44,230
FEMALE VOICE: The drive from
your location to Santa Cruz

2580
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:47,646
Beach Boardwalk is 73.9 miles.

2581
02:01:47,646 --> 02:01:53,020
[APPLAUSE]

2582
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:54,470
FEMALE VOICE: That was
my favorite search.

2583
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:55,170
And you know why?

2584
02:01:55,170 --> 02:01:57,060
It's because I barely
said anything.

2585
02:01:57,060 --> 02:02:00,630
It, here, well, somehow Google
knew that it was the Santa

2586
02:02:00,630 --> 02:02:04,520
Cruz Beach Boardwalk and
here was right here.

2587
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:06,730
Now, the final thing that I'm
going to need to prepare is

2588
02:02:06,730 --> 02:02:07,650
where to eat.

2589
02:02:07,650 --> 02:02:09,240
My kids love seafood.

2590
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:10,690
My daughter actually
loves muscles.

2591
02:02:10,690 --> 02:02:12,080
And it's pretty funny
to watch a

2592
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,830
four-year-old eating muscles.

2593
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:16,880
So why don't we try and find
a seafood restaurant?

2594
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:18,420
OK, Google.

2595
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:22,930
Show me seafood restaurants
in Santa Cruz.

2596
02:02:22,930 --> 02:02:24,540
FEMALE VOICE: Here are
addresses for seafood

2597
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:26,600
restaurants near Santa Cruz.

2598
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:27,870
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Now, I've heard
of this one, Johnny

2599
02:02:27,870 --> 02:02:29,910
Harborside.

2600
02:02:29,910 --> 02:02:32,950
I can click, look at the
details, and even go ahead and

2601
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:35,320
make reservations right here.

2602
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:36,650
So there you have it.

2603
02:02:36,650 --> 02:02:39,270
This is the latest voice
experience coming to Chrome

2604
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:41,591
and Chrome OS.

2605
02:02:41,591 --> 02:02:49,700
[APPLAUSE]

2606
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:50,770
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Now let's
fast forward to my

2607
02:02:50,770 --> 02:02:52,000
trip to Santa Cruz.

2608
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,590
Here I am enjoying
the beautiful

2609
02:02:53,590 --> 02:02:55,020
weather with my kids.

2610
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:56,690
We're going on the
kiddie rides.

2611
02:02:56,690 --> 02:02:58,100
But you know what I'm
thinking about.

2612
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:00,720
I'm think about how I can get
back to the Giant Dipper, that

2613
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:03,070
old wooden roller coaster.

2614
02:03:03,070 --> 02:03:04,960
I don't know if my kids are
tall enough to ride it.

2615
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,780
So we can walk over and check.

2616
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:09,140
Or wouldn't it be more
convenient to just ask Google?

2617
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:14,440

2618
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:16,875
How tall do you have to be
to ride the Giant Dipper?

2619
02:03:16,875 --> 02:03:21,210

2620
02:03:21,210 --> 02:03:23,500
FEMALE VOICE: You must be at
least four feet, three inches

2621
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:26,518
tall to ride Giant Dipper.

2622
02:03:26,518 --> 02:03:30,410
[APPLAUSE]

2623
02:03:30,410 --> 02:03:31,270
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Nice.

2624
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:32,530
Looks like my son can go on.

2625
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:34,870
My daughter's too short so my
husband's going to have to

2626
02:03:34,870 --> 02:03:37,010
wait this one out.

2627
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:39,510
So the next thing I'm going to
have to check is will I have

2628
02:03:39,510 --> 02:03:41,480
enough time to get to the Giant
Dipper and get back in

2629
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:43,075
time for my reservation?

2630
02:03:43,075 --> 02:03:46,730
Now, Google Now anticipates
my information needs.

2631
02:03:46,730 --> 02:03:50,710
So when I swipe up into Google
Now, I see the reservation

2632
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:52,050
right here.

2633
02:03:52,050 --> 02:03:55,270
It's at 2:00 PM and it's
only five minutes away.

2634
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:58,150
So now I know I can make
it over to the

2635
02:03:58,150 --> 02:03:59,360
roller coaster in time.

2636
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:01,700
And when I come back, I can
click on this Navigate link

2637
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:03,570
and get turn by turn directions
right to the

2638
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:04,820
restaurant.

2639
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:06,460

2640
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:08,240
So now let's fast
forward again.

2641
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:09,990
I've ridden the roller
coaster.

2642
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:10,992
I'm in the restaurant.

2643
02:04:10,992 --> 02:04:12,570
We're eating our muscles.

2644
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:14,550
And my husband and my
conversation turns to an

2645
02:04:14,550 --> 02:04:17,870
upcoming business trip I have
to New York this week.

2646
02:04:17,870 --> 02:04:20,670
Usually on Wednesdays I take
my daughter to school.

2647
02:04:20,670 --> 02:04:22,210
But I'm not sure if this
Wednesday I'm going to have

2648
02:04:22,210 --> 02:04:24,320
enough time to get her to school
and then make it to the

2649
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:27,090
airport to get my flight.

2650
02:04:27,090 --> 02:04:29,130
I don't quite remember
when my flight is.

2651
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:30,760
So wouldn't it be great
to just ask Google?

2652
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:34,170

2653
02:04:34,170 --> 02:04:35,840
When does my flight leave?

2654
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:39,010

2655
02:04:39,010 --> 02:04:42,350
FEMALE VOICE: Delta Airlines
flight 1940 from SFO to JFK

2656
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:47,910
leaves at 11:30 AM on May 22.

2657
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:52,320
[APPLAUSE]

2658
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,110
FEMALE VOICE: For those of you
participating in our search

2659
02:04:54,110 --> 02:04:57,770
field trial, this
will work today.

2660
02:04:57,770 --> 02:04:59,770
Now, the last time I was
in New York, I was

2661
02:04:59,770 --> 02:05:00,680
there with my family.

2662
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:01,680
I wasn't there on business.

2663
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:04,150
I was there with my family to
take them to see the sites.

2664
02:05:04,150 --> 02:05:05,190
I saw some old friends.

2665
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:06,780
I had them meet my kids.

2666
02:05:06,780 --> 02:05:09,030
And my friend Katie asked me
to be sure to give her call

2667
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:12,350
the next time I'm in town, be
sure that we can get together.

2668
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:17,000
So before I forget, why don't
I get in touch with Katie?

2669
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,380
Send an email to Katie.

2670
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:20,420
I'll be in town on Thursday and
was wondering if you're

2671
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:21,670
available for dinner.

2672
02:05:21,670 --> 02:05:26,040

2673
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:27,290
OK, sent.

2674
02:05:27,290 --> 02:05:30,164

2675
02:05:30,164 --> 02:05:37,090
[APPLAUSE]

2676
02:05:37,090 --> 02:05:38,330
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Now, Katie's
a bit forgetful.

2677
02:05:38,330 --> 02:05:40,070
So I want to make sure to
give her a call right

2678
02:05:40,070 --> 02:05:42,930
when I get to town.

2679
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:44,570
Remind me to call Katie
next Wednesday.

2680
02:05:44,570 --> 02:05:49,680

2681
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:52,150
What you see here is our
latest voice action,

2682
02:05:52,150 --> 02:05:55,970
reminders, that are launching
in Google Now today.

2683
02:05:55,970 --> 02:05:58,760
Reminders work on times,
dates, and locations,

2684
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:00,870
including home and work.

2685
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:03,690
Now, when I set this reminder
Google Now will remind me at

2686
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:06,890
just the right moment.

2687
02:06:06,890 --> 02:06:08,370
Fast forward again.

2688
02:06:08,370 --> 02:06:09,780
Fly to New York.

2689
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:11,260
I get out of my plane.

2690
02:06:11,260 --> 02:06:12,850
I go to get my taxi.

2691
02:06:12,850 --> 02:06:14,760
In the past what I would be
doing is rifling through my

2692
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:17,320
backpack for the reservation so
that I could tell the taxi

2693
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:21,010
driver where my hotel was.

2694
02:06:21,010 --> 02:06:22,950
But Google Now has just
the right information

2695
02:06:22,950 --> 02:06:24,770
just when I need it.

2696
02:06:24,770 --> 02:06:30,990
So I can swipe in, see my
reservation at the W. I scroll

2697
02:06:30,990 --> 02:06:33,670
down, I see my reminder
to call Katie.

2698
02:06:33,670 --> 02:06:35,430
So I've talked to
the taxi driver.

2699
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:36,550
I've talked to my
friend Katie.

2700
02:06:36,550 --> 02:06:38,090
I'm just sitting back.

2701
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:40,030
I'm so excited to be
back in New York.

2702
02:06:40,030 --> 02:06:43,280
I'm remembering the trip I had
last year when I took my kids

2703
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:45,430
around, when they met
my friend Katie.

2704
02:06:45,430 --> 02:06:49,270
I'd love to show Katie the
pictures from this last trip.

2705
02:06:49,270 --> 02:06:51,770
Now, for my final demo, wouldn't
it be great if I

2706
02:06:51,770 --> 02:06:53,020
could just ask Google?

2707
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:55,430

2708
02:06:55,430 --> 02:06:57,730
Show me my pictures from
New York last year.

2709
02:06:57,730 --> 02:07:02,600

2710
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:04,480
Oh, and those are my pictures
from New York.

2711
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:12,250

2712
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:14,440
And there's Katie reading
a book to my kids.

2713
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:17,810

2714
02:07:17,810 --> 02:07:20,130
These are the building blocks
and the experiences Amit was

2715
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:21,410
talking about.

2716
02:07:21,410 --> 02:07:24,330
I hope you are starting to see
how it's all coming together.

2717
02:07:24,330 --> 02:07:27,602
With that, let's welcome
Amit back on stage.

2718
02:07:27,602 --> 02:07:34,680
[APPLAUSE]

2719
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:36,070
AMIT SINGHAL: Thank
you, Johanna.

2720
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:40,240
I'm incredibly proud of the
search experience that we are

2721
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:43,740
building and tremendously
excited to bring it to

2722
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:47,170
hundreds of millions of people
around the world on the

2723
02:07:47,170 --> 02:07:49,900
devices they rely
on every day.

2724
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:52,590
It's important to remember,
though, this experience is

2725
02:07:52,590 --> 02:07:54,130
rapidly developing.

2726
02:07:54,130 --> 02:07:56,520
And it will take some time
before it becomes the

2727
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:58,860
predominant search experience.

2728
02:07:58,860 --> 02:08:03,030
There are several complex and
unsolved scientific problems

2729
02:08:03,030 --> 02:08:06,910
that we will have to solve
before we get there.

2730
02:08:06,910 --> 02:08:10,980
But our investment and
commitment to getting there

2731
02:08:10,980 --> 02:08:14,440
sooner rather than
later is immense.

2732
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:17,910
The announcements today are
a really good sign of the

2733
02:08:17,910 --> 02:08:20,270
progress we have made.

2734
02:08:20,270 --> 02:08:23,180
With more features in the
Knowledge Graph and more

2735
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:26,930
languages, conversational voice
search and hot wording

2736
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:31,230
coming to Chrome on desktops
and laptops, and new Now

2737
02:08:31,230 --> 02:08:34,650
functionality including
reminders and various other

2738
02:08:34,650 --> 02:08:38,610
cards, Search is really
becoming a beautiful

2739
02:08:38,610 --> 02:08:42,740
ubiquitous experience that
intelligently answers your

2740
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:45,770
questions and assists
you throughout the

2741
02:08:45,770 --> 02:08:49,070
day across all screens.

2742
02:08:49,070 --> 02:08:53,390
The idea of building such a
powerful means of getting

2743
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:58,920
knowledge to the world is what
inspires us every day.

2744
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:02,250
With the simple touch of a
mike, from the Queen of

2745
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:07,600
England to the most humble
farmer in Africa, from the

2746
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:12,550
developer who just joined the
Glass Explorer program to that

2747
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:16,840
the mother in a rural village
in India who just got her

2748
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:23,470
first basic smartphone, everyone
can easily access all

2749
02:09:23,470 --> 02:09:29,880
of humanity's information and
get what they need to improve

2750
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:32,900
their and their family's
lives.

2751
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:37,200
That, my friends, is the power
of the new search experience

2752
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:39,770
that we are building
at Google.

2753
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:44,240
And it will change how you and
I experience this beautiful

2754
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:46,870
journey that we call life.

2755
02:09:46,870 --> 02:09:49,187
Thank you.

2756
02:09:49,187 --> 02:09:59,460
[APPLAUSE]

2757
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:01,120
AMIT SINGHAL: And so we have
talked about the future of

2758
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:04,650
search and how it's changing
right before our eyes.

2759
02:10:04,650 --> 02:10:08,830
And we know that a perfect map
of the word is foundational to

2760
02:10:08,830 --> 02:10:12,990
delivering exactly what you
want, when you want it, and

2761
02:10:12,990 --> 02:10:14,620
where you want it.

2762
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:18,050
So I'd like to turn it over to
Brian McClendon to talk about

2763
02:10:18,050 --> 02:10:21,265
the future of Google Maps.

2764
02:10:21,265 --> 02:10:27,930
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2765
02:10:27,930 --> 02:10:31,220
BRIAN MCCLENDON: Thank
you very much.

2766
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:32,540
Hi.

2767
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:36,320
I'm Brian McClendon and I lead
the Maps team here at Google.

2768
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,850
Google Maps help you navigate
from place to place.

2769
02:10:38,850 --> 02:10:41,270
But it also helps you explore
and discover the

2770
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:42,730
world around you.

2771
02:10:42,730 --> 02:10:44,660
Today we're going to talk about
the future of Google

2772
02:10:44,660 --> 02:10:46,800
Maps and where it's going.

2773
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,810
But to talk about the future,
I need to talk a little bit

2774
02:10:48,810 --> 02:10:49,960
about the past.

2775
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:52,850
Back in 2005 Maps was
a problematic

2776
02:10:52,850 --> 02:10:54,080
experience on the internet.

2777
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:57,380
It was very slow, 10 to 20
seconds fora a map, multiple

2778
02:10:57,380 --> 02:10:59,330
boxes you had to type
things into.

2779
02:10:59,330 --> 02:11:01,500
Google Maps came up with the
idea of pre rendering the map

2780
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:04,110
tiles, providing that single
search box, and making a

2781
02:11:04,110 --> 02:11:05,900
smooth, fluid experience.

2782
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:06,520
And we launched.

2783
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:08,930
And many people were very
excited about it.

2784
02:11:08,930 --> 02:11:10,500
But Europeans had a
bit of an issue.

2785
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:11,940
And they sent this
screen shot.

2786
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:14,070
We had launched with only
part of the world.

2787
02:11:14,070 --> 02:11:16,210
[LAUGHTER]

2788
02:11:16,210 --> 02:11:17,900
BRIAN MCCLENDON: And it shows
the data is very important.

2789
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:19,390
We worked incredibly hard.

2790
02:11:19,390 --> 02:11:22,430
And by 2008 we had licensed
data and had turn by turn

2791
02:11:22,430 --> 02:11:24,280
directions in 22 countries.

2792
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:27,290
But we discovered that keeping
data up to date was very hard.

2793
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:29,920
We created a project called
Ground Truth.

2794
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:32,360
Ground Truth is taking
authoritative data sources,

2795
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:35,560
combining with all of the
process and algorithms at

2796
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:39,020
Google, and making the best data
set we can possibly make.

2797
02:11:39,020 --> 02:11:41,780
Recently we launched two more
countries, Thailand and

2798
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:45,530
Indonesia, bringing it to a
total of 43 countries overall

2799
02:11:45,530 --> 02:11:47,280
with the Ground Truth data.

2800
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:48,980
But this doesn't cover
the whole world.

2801
02:11:48,980 --> 02:11:51,140
In many cases, countries
didn't have good maps.

2802
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:53,180
We created a tool called
map maker.

2803
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:56,430
Map maker allows users to
contribute their data and make

2804
02:11:56,430 --> 02:11:57,370
the best maps they can.

2805
02:11:57,370 --> 02:12:00,110
And in some cases, those maps
are now the best maps that

2806
02:12:00,110 --> 02:12:01,360
country has anywhere.

2807
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:05,100
And that's helped us cover 199
countries around the world.

2808
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:06,680
But there's one country
that was missing.

2809
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:08,030
We had some of it
in map maker.

2810
02:12:08,030 --> 02:12:10,320
But just very recently
we published North

2811
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:15,030
Korea, making 200.

2812
02:12:15,030 --> 02:12:17,240
Now, you can take a
look at what North

2813
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:19,090
Korea looked like before.

2814
02:12:19,090 --> 02:12:23,920
We just had this river
and the city name.

2815
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:26,780
But adding all of the detail
for Google, actually having

2816
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:30,220
people tell us the POI's, the
places, the parks, the

2817
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:33,320
neighborhoods, the street, gives
it so much more depth.

2818
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:34,960
And there's another thing you
see on this map that was

2819
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:36,120
really important to us.

2820
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:38,910
Geocoded photos changed the
experience of everything.

2821
02:12:38,910 --> 02:12:41,640
They allow you to dip into a
place and really get a sense

2822
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:43,180
of the place exactly.

2823
02:12:43,180 --> 02:12:45,790
And those Geocoded photos
inspired us.

2824
02:12:45,790 --> 02:12:48,840
And in 2007 we launched a
product called Street View

2825
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:51,080
which actually created
these big panoramas.

2826
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:54,100
And we launched it in seven
cities in the United States.

2827
02:12:54,100 --> 02:12:56,250
But those seven cities
weren't enough.

2828
02:12:56,250 --> 02:12:57,340
Recently we launched two more

2829
02:12:57,340 --> 02:12:59,100
countries, Hungary and Lesotho.

2830
02:12:59,100 --> 02:13:02,290
And we now have 50 countries
around the world covered with

2831
02:13:02,290 --> 02:13:03,430
Street View imagery.

2832
02:13:03,430 --> 02:13:06,540
We've driven 5 million miles
with these cars.

2833
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:09,690
But we haven't just taken
Street View on the road.

2834
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:12,330
We've taken it on trains
up the Swiss Alps.

2835
02:13:12,330 --> 02:13:14,840
We've taken it down the
Amazon on a boat.

2836
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:17,900
And even added beautiful imagery
from the Great Barrier

2837
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:20,430
Reef and other places
around the ocean.

2838
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:23,370
And as you can see here, this
is an incredibly immersive

2839
02:13:23,370 --> 02:13:25,280
experience.

2840
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:29,300
So being able to go here, unless
you're a snorkeler or

2841
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:31,430
scuba diver, you'll never
visit this place.

2842
02:13:31,430 --> 02:13:35,020
But you can really get a taste
of how the different places

2843
02:13:35,020 --> 02:13:37,720
look and preview the
place overall.

2844
02:13:37,720 --> 02:13:40,670
This was the imagination that
created Google Earth in the

2845
02:13:40,670 --> 02:13:41,600
first place.

2846
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:43,430
Imagery is very important
to us.

2847
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:46,170
And we've been working with
satellite imagery and aerial

2848
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:47,730
imagery for a long time.

2849
02:13:47,730 --> 02:13:51,610
But in 2012 we started
generating new data from our

2850
02:13:51,610 --> 02:13:53,060
existing aerial imagery.

2851
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:55,900
Combining oblique images, many
different photographs from

2852
02:13:55,900 --> 02:13:58,440
around a building, we're
actually able to generate 3D

2853
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:00,240
geometry of large,
urban cores.

2854
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:03,250
And we're now covering far more
places with 3D buildings

2855
02:14:03,250 --> 02:14:05,090
than we ever had before.

2856
02:14:05,090 --> 02:14:08,570
This idea of generating data
from other data is fundamental

2857
02:14:08,570 --> 02:14:10,120
to what Google does.

2858
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:12,670
We have so many different
sources of it that there are

2859
02:14:12,670 --> 02:14:15,350
also so many different kinds
of areas you can have.

2860
02:14:15,350 --> 02:14:16,730
We have the base maps.

2861
02:14:16,730 --> 02:14:19,570
We have Street View drivers with
GPS tracks of their cars.

2862
02:14:19,570 --> 02:14:22,940
We have images from Street View,
Satellite, aerial, those

2863
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:25,100
3D buildings I talked about,
and also terrain

2864
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:26,460
data that we generated.

2865
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:28,920
Each one of them is good
but can be improved in

2866
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:29,640
combination.

2867
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:31,560
And this combination, it's
called bundle adjusting.

2868
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:33,820
And it's incredibly important
to improving the quality of

2869
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:35,220
Maps overall.

2870
02:14:35,220 --> 02:14:37,000
You know, one of the best
examples of this is our local

2871
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,250
business data.

2872
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:40,600
Locating local businesses
precisely is

2873
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:41,880
actually pretty hard.

2874
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:44,840
But using Street View,
computer vision, and

2875
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:47,970
algorithms we now have over 40
million precise geocodes

2876
02:14:47,970 --> 02:14:50,860
locating these businesses around
the world, making ours

2877
02:14:50,860 --> 02:14:54,000
the most comprehensive data set
of precisely located local

2878
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,350
businesses.

2879
02:14:55,350 --> 02:14:59,410
So this data is at the basis of
everything that Google does

2880
02:14:59,410 --> 02:15:00,800
with its products.

2881
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:03,230
But it's also at the basis of
everything that you do.

2882
02:15:03,230 --> 02:15:06,370
In 2005 Google Maps
API launched.

2883
02:15:06,370 --> 02:15:10,620
But in the last year we've had
30% year over year growth.

2884
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:13,080
And today, I'd like to announce
we have over one

2885
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:17,320
million websites using Google
Maps in their site and

2886
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:19,284
improving their site.

2887
02:15:19,284 --> 02:15:24,260
[APPLAUSE]

2888
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:26,820
BRIAN MCCLENDON: These sites are
visited by over a billion

2889
02:15:26,820 --> 02:15:30,790
people every week and actually
get more use than Google Maps

2890
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:32,500
does on Google products alone.

2891
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:34,470
So Google Maps API is incredibly
important to us.

2892
02:15:34,470 --> 02:15:37,810
And it's thanks to people like
you who've added their Google

2893
02:15:37,810 --> 02:15:40,100
Maps to the power of
their application.

2894
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:42,550
Now, obviously applications
are important to you.

2895
02:15:42,550 --> 02:15:44,910
And you heard about Hugo
introducing the various mobile

2896
02:15:44,910 --> 02:15:46,950
APIs for Android.

2897
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:50,130
And they have really improved
things with user location and

2898
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:52,450
the Android SDK for Maps V2.

2899
02:15:52,450 --> 02:15:55,520
We also have Google
Maps SDK for iOS.

2900
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:59,570
And being able to bring Google
Maps 3D camera motion and

2901
02:15:59,570 --> 02:16:01,810
fluid motion into your
applications, I think, has

2902
02:16:01,810 --> 02:16:03,510
changed a lot of the
applications around.

2903
02:16:03,510 --> 02:16:05,270
And the uptake has
been incredible.

2904
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:07,660
I'd like to quickly introduce
the 17 sessions that we're

2905
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:09,270
going to have in the Google
Maps track over the next

2906
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:12,500
couple of days and highlight
one thing in particular.

2907
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:14,100
There's a product called Google
Maps Engine that you

2908
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:17,520
may have heard of, uploading
your data into the cloud.

2909
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:20,250
If you can do that, you can
serve your data to everybody

2910
02:16:20,250 --> 02:16:22,615
with the same performance and
quality and integrate it with

2911
02:16:22,615 --> 02:16:24,240
the Google Maps experience.

2912
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:26,750
And with the Google Maps API,
you can actually have your

2913
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:29,820
applications read and write
that data set and really

2914
02:16:29,820 --> 02:16:31,430
change how things work.

2915
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:34,100
But now I'd like to introduce
Daniel Graf, who is going to

2916
02:16:34,100 --> 02:16:37,710
talk about the next generation
of Google Maps for mobile.

2917
02:16:37,710 --> 02:16:39,180
Daniel.

2918
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:50,459
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2919
02:16:50,459 --> 02:16:51,609
DANIEL GRAF: Thank you, Brian.

2920
02:16:51,609 --> 02:16:53,030
Hi, everyone.

2921
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:56,040
I know when it comes to mobile
phones, everyone in here is

2922
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:57,870
probably here for Android.

2923
02:16:57,870 --> 02:17:01,990
But as most of you probably
heard last December, we

2924
02:17:01,990 --> 02:17:04,879
launched Google Maps
on the iPhone.

2925
02:17:04,879 --> 02:17:07,110
It has been a tremendous
success.

2926
02:17:07,110 --> 02:17:08,940
The feedback has been
very positive.

2927
02:17:08,940 --> 02:17:12,280
People called it sleek,
simple, beautiful.

2928
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:14,629
And let's not forget,
accurate.

2929
02:17:14,629 --> 02:17:20,870
[LAUGHTER]

2930
02:17:20,870 --> 02:17:23,389
DANIEL GRAF: So if you're an
iPhone user, you don't have it

2931
02:17:23,389 --> 02:17:25,790
on your phone yet, go
to the app store.

2932
02:17:25,790 --> 02:17:27,200
Download it today.

2933
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:30,270
Brian talked a lot about the
power of Google Maps data.

2934
02:17:30,270 --> 02:17:33,400
He mentioned we're going beyond
just directions and

2935
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:34,680
navigation.

2936
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:38,700
Maps are also about exploring
and discovering places.

2937
02:17:38,700 --> 02:17:40,760
And no where is that
more critical

2938
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:42,540
than on a mobile phone.

2939
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:45,330
Today we're going to announce
and we're going to give you a

2940
02:17:45,330 --> 02:17:48,969
sneak preview of the next major
release from Google Maps

2941
02:17:48,969 --> 02:17:54,370
for mobile coming to enjoy
and, of course, iOS.

2942
02:17:54,370 --> 02:17:55,959
For that we're going
to take a little

2943
02:17:55,959 --> 02:17:57,990
stroll through San Francisco.

2944
02:17:57,990 --> 02:18:01,209
I'm going to start here
on my Nexus 4.

2945
02:18:01,209 --> 02:18:06,670
And, as you can see, when I
start this it's a brand new

2946
02:18:06,670 --> 02:18:08,740
design, a new look.

2947
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:10,870
And actually we're at Moscone.

2948
02:18:10,870 --> 02:18:13,040
I can zoom in.

2949
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:16,700
I can see all the beautiful 3D
buildings, which we also saw

2950
02:18:16,700 --> 02:18:18,959
in the Android demo before.

2951
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:22,480
But for now, as I mentioned,
sometimes it's about what is

2952
02:18:22,480 --> 02:18:23,930
the right place to go.

2953
02:18:23,930 --> 02:18:27,510
So at the moment, let's say I'm
in the mood for Burmese

2954
02:18:27,510 --> 02:18:30,480
food and here in
San Francisco.

2955
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:33,780
So I'm just going to search
for Burmese food.

2956
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:37,326
And when you look at the
results, the first result we

2957
02:18:37,326 --> 02:18:39,780
get is Burma SuperStar
has a 4.0

2958
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:42,000
rating, over 1,000 reviews.

2959
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,930
Well, I want to find out more.

2960
02:18:43,930 --> 02:18:46,219
I actually see my friend,
Salahuddin.

2961
02:18:46,219 --> 02:18:48,389
He rated it five stars.

2962
02:18:48,389 --> 02:18:49,760
I trust his taste.

2963
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:50,950
So I want to look
a little more.

2964
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:52,270
I just swipe down.

2965
02:18:52,270 --> 02:18:54,360
I have different imagery
I can look at.

2966
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:56,730
Of course, once you go there,
you can rate and review.

2967
02:18:56,730 --> 02:18:58,620
You can upload photos.

2968
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:01,450
And as some of you, here
I have different

2969
02:19:01,450 --> 02:19:02,660
reviews I can see.

2970
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:05,450
And some of you noticed
here, there's a rating

2971
02:19:05,450 --> 02:19:07,469
scale of 4.0 there.

2972
02:19:07,469 --> 02:19:10,530
So today we're going to announce
a new five point

2973
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:13,910
rating scale across all Google
Maps products, so if you

2974
02:19:13,910 --> 02:19:17,889
search for a restaurant on
google.com or if you use Maps

2975
02:19:17,889 --> 02:19:20,790
on the desktop or on
a mobile phone.

2976
02:19:20,790 --> 02:19:23,820
Now I want to go to a
different use case.

2977
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:25,740
And it's actually quite
a common one.

2978
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:28,139
Now, how often have you
searched for pizza?

2979
02:19:28,139 --> 02:19:29,219
That's what we're going to do.

2980
02:19:29,219 --> 02:19:32,360
And we're going to do it this
time in the Mission District.

2981
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:36,389
And let's see where we are.

2982
02:19:36,389 --> 02:19:38,660
Let's see what results
we're getting here.

2983
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:41,360
And no surprise, we're getting
a lot of results.

2984
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:43,090
And with this new UI,
it's very easy to

2985
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:43,990
browse through it.

2986
02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:46,370
I can just swipe to
different results.

2987
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:49,680
I can bring up the details
and look at is this a

2988
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:50,630
good place to go.

2989
02:19:50,630 --> 02:19:52,240
But something caught
my eye here.

2990
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:53,530
It's the Zagat badge.

2991
02:19:53,530 --> 02:19:55,020
What does that mean?

2992
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:57,540
And before we looked
at user reviews

2993
02:19:57,540 --> 02:19:59,410
and my friends reviews.

2994
02:19:59,410 --> 02:20:01,260
But sometimes you want
to have a trusted

2995
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:02,950
opinion from an expert.

2996
02:20:02,950 --> 02:20:07,120
We integrated a brand new
Zagat experience.

2997
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:11,910
And, as you know, Zagat is one
of the most trusted brands on

2998
02:20:11,910 --> 02:20:14,840
opinions about restaurants
and places to go.

2999
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:16,260
Here you see little cart.

3000
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:19,870
And you see the pizzeria Delfina
is actually on a list

3001
02:20:19,870 --> 02:20:22,680
called restaurants worth the
wait in San Francisco.

3002
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:25,440
I can also get all the details,
such as the editorial

3003
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:28,060
review from Zagat and
the Zagat scores.

3004
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:32,680
So sometimes it's important to
get a trusted expert to tell

3005
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:35,080
you, hey, this is a
place you can go.

3006
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:40,290
Now it has been quite a long
morning, an exciting morning.

3007
02:20:40,290 --> 02:20:43,380
But I'm going go back to where
we are right now around

3008
02:20:43,380 --> 02:20:47,130
Moscone and downtown here
in San Francisco.

3009
02:20:47,130 --> 02:20:49,450
And what I'm going to look
for is I'm in the

3010
02:20:49,450 --> 02:20:50,820
mood for some coffee.

3011
02:20:50,820 --> 02:20:53,980
So I'm going to search
for coffee.

3012
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:56,440
And let's see what the
results are here.

3013
02:20:56,440 --> 02:21:00,820
And, for example, well, first
result, surprise, surprise.

3014
02:21:00,820 --> 02:21:02,530
There's a lot of Starbucks
in town.

3015
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:03,335
Has a high rating.

3016
02:21:03,335 --> 02:21:07,130
And something else caught
my eye here, an offer.

3017
02:21:07,130 --> 02:21:08,380
Let's have a look at it.

3018
02:21:08,380 --> 02:21:11,440
And actually we have integrated
here a brand new

3019
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:14,740
offers experience with great
deals from some of the world's

3020
02:21:14,740 --> 02:21:15,710
best brands.

3021
02:21:15,710 --> 02:21:17,390
In this example, this
is Starbucks.

3022
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:20,000
And as we see, they're
introducing a new drink,

3023
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,780
Starbucks Refreshers
this afternoon.

3024
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:23,910
Half price off.

3025
02:21:23,910 --> 02:21:24,880
Please don't run there.

3026
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:26,400
I'm giving you a preview here.

3027
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:29,610
And if we go in there,
I can get the

3028
02:21:29,610 --> 02:21:31,270
details about the offer.

3029
02:21:31,270 --> 02:21:33,340
And then I can save it
for later as well.

3030
02:21:33,340 --> 02:21:35,640
So we see here the
offer about it.

3031
02:21:35,640 --> 02:21:37,460
I use it later.

3032
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:40,340
And then I can go this afternoon
if I want to.

3033
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:42,840
We have many launch partners
beyond Starbucks.

3034
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:44,790
And there's many more to come.

3035
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:47,240
This is the new offers
experience in

3036
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:49,230
Google Maps for mobile.

3037
02:21:49,230 --> 02:21:53,890
So now I want to talk a little
bit about directions.

3038
02:21:53,890 --> 02:21:56,680
And a lot of you are using
public transport.

3039
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:59,460
I know that when I look
at our numbers.

3040
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:03,110
We have currently over a million
transit stops in the

3041
02:22:03,110 --> 02:22:04,930
whole world which we cover.

3042
02:22:04,930 --> 02:22:07,900
And for those who are using
cars or ride around with

3043
02:22:07,900 --> 02:22:12,150
bicycles, 50 billion kilometers
of turn by turn

3044
02:22:12,150 --> 02:22:13,330
directions.

3045
02:22:13,330 --> 02:22:16,130
Imagine, 15 billion
kilometers.

3046
02:22:16,130 --> 02:22:19,700
Today we're going to announce
several new key features to

3047
02:22:19,700 --> 02:22:22,540
make your navigation experience
even better.

3048
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:25,620
For example, we have a revamped
incident experience.

3049
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:29,460
We're adding live coverage
of incidents from

3050
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:31,010
all around the world.

3051
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:33,740
So in traffic view, for example,
you can see in real

3052
02:22:33,740 --> 02:22:35,840
time incident alerts.

3053
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:40,120
You can just tap on it to see
details and then you know

3054
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:40,500
what's going on.

3055
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:44,380
Even cooler, another feature
is dynamic rerouting.

3056
02:22:44,380 --> 02:22:49,020
Let's say you're driving along
your route and something

3057
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:50,090
happens ahead of you.

3058
02:22:50,090 --> 02:22:51,590
The conditions worsen.

3059
02:22:51,590 --> 02:22:54,460
Google gives you an early
warning and it tells you, hey,

3060
02:22:54,460 --> 02:22:56,480
there's a better
route to take.

3061
02:22:56,480 --> 02:23:00,620
So this was the next generation
of Google Maps for

3062
02:23:00,620 --> 02:23:02,010
smartphones.

3063
02:23:02,010 --> 02:23:03,440
And &mdash;

3064
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:04,388
thank you.

3065
02:23:04,388 --> 02:23:07,740
[APPLAUSE]

3066
02:23:07,740 --> 02:23:13,380
DANIEL GRAF: As we all know,
mobile today is not just about

3067
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:15,010
smartphones.

3068
02:23:15,010 --> 02:23:16,790
Should we go a little bigger?

3069
02:23:16,790 --> 02:23:18,410
Screen size?

3070
02:23:18,410 --> 02:23:24,520
So I'm very happy to announce
today that we have a brand new

3071
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:27,900
fully dedicated tablet
Maps experience.

3072
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:29,380
And we're going to have
a little look here.

3073
02:23:29,380 --> 02:23:31,650
So we're still here
in San Francisco.

3074
02:23:31,650 --> 02:23:33,860
I'm going to scroll around
a little bit.

3075
02:23:33,860 --> 02:23:35,330
And actually we are
here downtown.

3076
02:23:35,330 --> 02:23:37,000
Here's something pretty cool.

3077
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,850
And, by the way, all the
features you have seen on the

3078
02:23:38,850 --> 02:23:41,080
smartphone and on the tablet,
they work vice

3079
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:42,760
versa on both platforms.

3080
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:43,880
Here we're at Macy's.

3081
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:44,980
We have indoors.

3082
02:23:44,980 --> 02:23:48,070
We have tens of thousands of
places in the world where you

3083
02:23:48,070 --> 02:23:51,750
can see into the buildings and
see what stores are there,

3084
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:53,410
what you can find out
there, what's

3085
02:23:53,410 --> 02:23:54,710
going on in those buildings.

3086
02:23:54,710 --> 02:23:57,580
But sometimes you don't
really know what

3087
02:23:57,580 --> 02:23:58,400
you're in the mood for.

3088
02:23:58,400 --> 02:24:00,220
You're like entertain
me, show me.

3089
02:24:00,220 --> 02:24:02,080
What can I discover
in San Francisco?

3090
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:03,320
I'm visiting here.

3091
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:05,420
So you're not typing
in a search query.

3092
02:24:05,420 --> 02:24:07,760
All you do is &mdash; and this
is a new experience.

3093
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:09,230
You say let's explore.

3094
02:24:09,230 --> 02:24:11,900
And it's a beautiful explore
experience where you can say,

3095
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:15,760
I'm in a mood to eat something,
to drink, to shop.

3096
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:17,020
[APPLAUSE]

3097
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:19,130
DANIEL GRAF: It's a little
early to sleep right now.

3098
02:24:19,130 --> 02:24:20,970
So I would say, let's play.

3099
02:24:20,970 --> 02:24:22,440
Let's get entertained.

3100
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:25,580
And when I go through this, I
can go to museums, to public

3101
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:26,880
parks, and &mdash;

3102
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:30,170
well, let's take one you
probably heard before, the

3103
02:24:30,170 --> 02:24:31,360
Golden Gate Bridge.

3104
02:24:31,360 --> 02:24:33,520
Very high rating, 4.6.

3105
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:36,540
As you get all the details here
and just at the touch of

3106
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:39,580
a button, you want to see
how it looks like there.

3107
02:24:39,580 --> 02:24:41,180
You have the Street
View experience.

3108
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:43,880
And, of course, it's very easy
to go there afterwards.

3109
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:47,440
So this is a new way to explore
and discover your

3110
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:49,290
surroundings.

3111
02:24:49,290 --> 02:24:50,300
There you have it.

3112
02:24:50,300 --> 02:24:53,440
So these were just a few of the
new features for Google

3113
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:55,030
Maps for mobile.

3114
02:24:55,030 --> 02:24:57,030
It's a brand new experience.

3115
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:59,700
And as I mentioned, we emphasize
a lot on discovery,

3116
02:24:59,700 --> 02:25:03,340
exploration, better navigation,
and a beautiful

3117
02:25:03,340 --> 02:25:05,030
new design.

3118
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:08,510
We are truly excited about
this new product.

3119
02:25:08,510 --> 02:25:12,890
It's coming to your Android
devices and your iOS devices,

3120
02:25:12,890 --> 02:25:16,410
smartphones, and tablets
this summer.

3121
02:25:16,410 --> 02:25:19,524
It's pretty cool, right?

3122
02:25:19,524 --> 02:25:21,332
[APPLAUSE]

3123
02:25:21,332 --> 02:25:21,784
DANIEL GRAF: Thanks.

3124
02:25:21,784 --> 02:25:25,070
But where are we going to go
next with Google Maps?

3125
02:25:25,070 --> 02:25:29,060
As Brian mentioned earlier on,
Google Maps launched in 2005.

3126
02:25:29,060 --> 02:25:32,820
We currently have over a billion
users every month

3127
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:34,480
using our products.

3128
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:36,740
And as you all know,
Google Maps has

3129
02:25:36,740 --> 02:25:39,380
defined modern mapping.

3130
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:42,740
And we're about to reinvent
it again.

3131
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:45,560
And for that I want to introduce
Berni and Jonah.

3132
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:47,790
And they're going to tell you
a little bit more about the

3133
02:25:47,790 --> 02:25:49,380
future of Google Maps.

3134
02:25:49,380 --> 02:25:51,200
Berni, Jonah.

3135
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:56,000
[APPLAUSE]

3136
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:59,370

3137
02:25:59,370 --> 02:26:01,480
BERNI SEEFELD: Remember
the first time

3138
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:03,560
you used Google Maps.

3139
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:07,390
And now imagine that
same feeling again.

3140
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:09,970
We have been working on
something that we believe

3141
02:26:09,970 --> 02:26:11,980
that's just that.

3142
02:26:11,980 --> 02:26:15,250
We looked at we have today
and we saw there's

3143
02:26:15,250 --> 02:26:17,410
three things missing.

3144
02:26:17,410 --> 02:26:22,250
Number one, you and me and
everybody else, we look at the

3145
02:26:22,250 --> 02:26:24,170
exact same map.

3146
02:26:24,170 --> 02:26:28,350
Wouldn't it be awesome if you
could build billions of maps,

3147
02:26:28,350 --> 02:26:30,610
one for every user?

3148
02:26:30,610 --> 02:26:35,490
And not only that, a map that
adapts to what you do, a map

3149
02:26:35,490 --> 02:26:37,330
built for you.

3150
02:26:37,330 --> 02:26:41,610
And number two, Google has all
this imagery, from satellite

3151
02:26:41,610 --> 02:26:44,950
to streets, indoors, and
even under water.

3152
02:26:44,950 --> 02:26:47,630
Wouldn't it be cool if you could
bring this all together

3153
02:26:47,630 --> 02:26:52,670
into one experience that would
be fun and easy to explore?

3154
02:26:52,670 --> 02:26:56,610
And number three, what if you
could make everything simpler

3155
02:26:56,610 --> 02:26:59,910
and more powerful by coming
up with whole new ways to

3156
02:26:59,910 --> 02:27:01,960
interact with the map
itself, making

3157
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:04,640
that map-to-user interface.

3158
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:08,230
With these three principles and
our great data foundation,

3159
02:27:08,230 --> 02:27:14,120
we went ahead and rebuilt Google
Maps on the ground up.

3160
02:27:14,120 --> 02:27:16,020
Jonah, show us how it looks.

3161
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:18,834
JONAH JONES: This is the
new Google Maps.

3162
02:27:18,834 --> 02:27:24,500
[APPLAUSE]

3163
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:26,220
JONAH JONES: Focusing the design
and the interactions on

3164
02:27:26,220 --> 02:27:28,210
the map had made everything
simpler and a

3165
02:27:28,210 --> 02:27:29,760
real pleasure to use.

3166
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:31,810
The map is rich and
beautiful with

3167
02:27:31,810 --> 02:27:35,000
vibrant colors and textures.

3168
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,330
BERNI SEEFELD: So this is a
computer running Chrome.

3169
02:27:37,330 --> 02:27:41,290
And we're using the latest open
standards like WebGL to

3170
02:27:41,290 --> 02:27:44,450
make the experience really
smooth since snappy.

3171
02:27:44,450 --> 02:27:47,990
These are vector maps
in a browser.

3172
02:27:47,990 --> 02:27:50,360
So let me tell you
a little story.

3173
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:51,620
I just moved here about
a year ago.

3174
02:27:51,620 --> 02:27:52,650
This is a nice neighborhood.

3175
02:27:52,650 --> 02:27:55,680
And it was an exciting time as
I got to explore a new area.

3176
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:56,900
And I love exploring.

3177
02:27:56,900 --> 02:27:59,080
And so one of the first things
I did was search for

3178
02:27:59,080 --> 02:28:01,820
restaurants.

3179
02:28:01,820 --> 02:28:04,990
And this is our new search
experience, no

3180
02:28:04,990 --> 02:28:06,460
more just ten pins.

3181
02:28:06,460 --> 02:28:09,850
All the results are labeled
directly on the map.

3182
02:28:09,850 --> 02:28:13,100
This makes exploring really
fast and easy.

3183
02:28:13,100 --> 02:28:16,270
And the top results, they come
with a useful description that

3184
02:28:16,270 --> 02:28:18,700
gives you a flavor of the
place so you can make

3185
02:28:18,700 --> 02:28:19,970
decisions very quickly.

3186
02:28:19,970 --> 02:28:22,810

3187
02:28:22,810 --> 02:28:25,490
No need for cross referencing
Everything is right

3188
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:26,590
there on the map.

3189
02:28:26,590 --> 02:28:29,390
The map is the user interface.

3190
02:28:29,390 --> 02:28:31,650
Now, of course, there's this
other way how you can find

3191
02:28:31,650 --> 02:28:32,950
restaurants.

3192
02:28:32,950 --> 02:28:34,660
You can ask your friends.

3193
02:28:34,660 --> 02:28:36,330
And now you can do
that directly in

3194
02:28:36,330 --> 02:28:38,360
the new Google Maps.

3195
02:28:38,360 --> 02:28:41,160
We added a filter.

3196
02:28:41,160 --> 02:28:44,530
And now you see those search
results are the sushi places

3197
02:28:44,530 --> 02:28:47,410
that my friends have reviewed,
like Kiji here that my friend

3198
02:28:47,410 --> 02:28:50,130
Stephanie likes.

3199
02:28:50,130 --> 02:28:52,150
And these are our new cards.

3200
02:28:52,150 --> 02:28:56,020
They summarize everything that
is important about this place.

3201
02:28:56,020 --> 02:28:58,580
But earlier I was talking
about imagery.

3202
02:28:58,580 --> 02:29:01,020
And you see those
three photos.

3203
02:29:01,020 --> 02:29:02,640
And I love this part.

3204
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:05,074
Let's take a closer look.

3205
02:29:05,074 --> 02:29:13,536
[APPLAUSE]

3206
02:29:13,536 --> 02:29:16,840
BERNI SEEFELD: We just flew into
our new immersive imagery

3207
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:17,795
experience.

3208
02:29:17,795 --> 02:29:19,400
And it actually looks
like a great place.

3209
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:22,510
I might go there tonight.

3210
02:29:22,510 --> 02:29:23,090
Let's head back out.

3211
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:24,380
Clear the search.

3212
02:29:24,380 --> 02:29:27,910
So earlier I was saying this
map is built for you.

3213
02:29:27,910 --> 02:29:30,510
Let me show you how
that works.

3214
02:29:30,510 --> 02:29:32,960
So I've been living in this
area for about a year now.

3215
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:34,820
And I've done many,
many searches.

3216
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:37,436
I've reviewed places, starred
places, and I

3217
02:29:37,436 --> 02:29:38,700
made great new friends.

3218
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:42,090
And my map got better
and better.

3219
02:29:42,090 --> 02:29:45,610
The places you see on this map,
they are my landmarks.

3220
02:29:45,610 --> 02:29:48,940
Like Frances here, that's one of
the first places I went to.

3221
02:29:48,940 --> 02:29:49,680
It's a great restaurant.

3222
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:51,380
I love it and I keep
going back.

3223
02:29:51,380 --> 02:29:53,880
So it's very important to me.

3224
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:56,500
And just the other day someone
told me about a bike shop and

3225
02:29:56,500 --> 02:29:58,290
said it's right next
to Frances.

3226
02:29:58,290 --> 02:30:00,100
And I knew exactly
where it is.

3227
02:30:00,100 --> 02:30:03,910
It is a landmark for me and
that's why it's on my map.

3228
02:30:03,910 --> 02:30:05,670
But it's a fairly small place.

3229
02:30:05,670 --> 02:30:07,790
So it might not be
on Jonah's map.

3230
02:30:07,790 --> 02:30:09,580
It might not be on your map.

3231
02:30:09,580 --> 02:30:13,160
But it's a landmark for me,
and so it's on my map.

3232
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:16,510
And when you are logged in,
you get your map and we'll

3233
02:30:16,510 --> 02:30:20,360
highlight everything that
is important to you.

3234
02:30:20,360 --> 02:30:22,360
Now, it's not just about
all the places

3235
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:23,800
that I already know.

3236
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:26,610
A good friend of mine is in town
for I/O. And I thought we

3237
02:30:26,610 --> 02:30:28,940
could try a new restaurant.

3238
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:32,250
My map is going to help
me with just that.

3239
02:30:32,250 --> 02:30:35,070
See these places here, they
are recommendations.

3240
02:30:35,070 --> 02:30:37,980
Like Bar Tartine shows
up because

3241
02:30:37,980 --> 02:30:39,180
it's similar to Frances.

3242
02:30:39,180 --> 02:30:42,210
And I looked like Frances so
it's a recommendation for me.

3243
02:30:42,210 --> 02:30:44,390
And Foreign Cinema shows
up because my

3244
02:30:44,390 --> 02:30:45,915
friend Anita likes it.

3245
02:30:45,915 --> 02:30:48,910
So these two look like
great options.

3246
02:30:48,910 --> 02:30:52,200
And this is how Google Maps
helps you discover new places

3247
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:54,640
without even having to search.

3248
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:58,860
So this is how we can build a
map for you using the same

3249
02:30:58,860 --> 02:31:02,500
data as Google Now so it will
get better and better the more

3250
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:05,076
you use it.

3251
02:31:05,076 --> 02:31:10,764
[APPLAUSE]

3252
02:31:10,764 --> 02:31:12,110
BERNI SEEFELD: So that's
how we build a

3253
02:31:12,110 --> 02:31:14,140
map for every person.

3254
02:31:14,140 --> 02:31:17,585
Now let me show you how we build
a map for every place.

3255
02:31:17,585 --> 02:31:21,925
So next weekend some friends
of mine from Italy are in

3256
02:31:21,925 --> 02:31:24,060
town, and they have children.

3257
02:31:24,060 --> 02:31:26,060
So I thought we could go
to the Randall Museum.

3258
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:28,700
It's near my home, and it's
really great for kids.

3259
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:30,700
But it's a little bit
tricky to get to.

3260
02:31:30,700 --> 02:31:33,630
See, this little road here that
leads up to the museum,

3261
02:31:33,630 --> 02:31:34,970
it's not even labeled.

3262
02:31:34,970 --> 02:31:35,980
And that makes perfect sense.

3263
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:37,980
It's a very small unimportant
road.

3264
02:31:37,980 --> 02:31:40,600
But it's important for
the Randall Museum.

3265
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:44,890
So watch what happens
when we click on it?

3266
02:31:44,890 --> 02:31:48,350
Now the street is labeled and
all the other streets that

3267
02:31:48,350 --> 02:31:51,034
lead to this place are
highlighted as well.

3268
02:31:51,034 --> 02:31:56,710
[APPLAUSE]

3269
02:31:56,710 --> 02:31:59,220
BERNI SEEFELD: Let's
have another look.

3270
02:31:59,220 --> 02:32:02,140
Before, a regular map.

3271
02:32:02,140 --> 02:32:06,520
And after the roads are
highlighted and labeled.

3272
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:08,670
This map makes it so much easier
to understand how to

3273
02:32:08,670 --> 02:32:10,510
get to this place.

3274
02:32:10,510 --> 02:32:13,060
So we can build a unique
map for every

3275
02:32:13,060 --> 02:32:15,230
place on every click.

3276
02:32:15,230 --> 02:32:16,708
Isn't that amazing?

3277
02:32:16,708 --> 02:32:22,190
[APPLAUSE]

3278
02:32:22,190 --> 02:32:23,990
BERNI SEEFELD: But I know my
friend's kids and they will

3279
02:32:23,990 --> 02:32:26,140
definitely want to
explore more.

3280
02:32:26,140 --> 02:32:28,710
Now that's going to be really
easy because now all the

3281
02:32:28,710 --> 02:32:30,720
landmarks you see on
the map are related

3282
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:32,830
to the Randall Museum.

3283
02:32:32,830 --> 02:32:34,780
And so they're all about
kids and museums.

3284
02:32:34,780 --> 02:32:36,740
You can see the Cartoon
Art Museum.

3285
02:32:36,740 --> 02:32:38,780
You can see the Walt
Disney Museum.

3286
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:41,600
And when we click on that, we
get a whole new map with new

3287
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:42,860
places to explore.

3288
02:32:42,860 --> 02:32:44,180
So we can click on the
Exploratorium.

3289
02:32:44,180 --> 02:32:45,220
And when we click on

3290
02:32:45,220 --> 02:32:47,010
Exploratorium, another map appears.

3291
02:32:47,010 --> 02:32:48,680
So we can keep going
and going.

3292
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:51,638
This is a great way to
explore new places.

3293
02:32:51,638 --> 02:32:56,430
[APPLAUSE]

3294
02:32:56,430 --> 02:32:57,550
BERNI SEEFELD: It's
really east, just

3295
02:32:57,550 --> 02:32:58,670
clicking and clicking.

3296
02:32:58,670 --> 02:33:00,780
So it's simple and powerful.

3297
02:33:00,780 --> 02:33:04,370
The map is the user interface.

3298
02:33:04,370 --> 02:33:06,320
So now let's see how
we can get there.

3299
02:33:06,320 --> 02:33:08,480
So we could click here
on directions.

3300
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:11,950
But for the most common case
there's an even simpler way.

3301
02:33:11,950 --> 02:33:14,120
See, my home is right
there on the map.

3302
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:16,390
And it says a 60 minute drive.

3303
02:33:16,390 --> 02:33:18,860
So if I want to get directions
from my home, I can

3304
02:33:18,860 --> 02:33:20,560
just click on that.

3305
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:23,592
And this is our new directions
experience.

3306
02:33:23,592 --> 02:33:29,260
[APPLAUSE]

3307
02:33:29,260 --> 02:33:31,140
BERNI SEEFELD: A great new
thing is that we directly

3308
02:33:31,140 --> 02:33:34,225
compare driving with public
transit on the map.

3309
02:33:34,225 --> 02:33:36,690
And that's going to be really
useful because this weekend we

3310
02:33:36,690 --> 02:33:39,150
won't have a car.

3311
02:33:39,150 --> 02:33:42,890
And we wanted to make public
transit much, much smarter.

3312
02:33:42,890 --> 02:33:45,890
Before, we showed you the
next three departures.

3313
02:33:45,890 --> 02:33:48,740
But now we are going to look
at every departure, every

3314
02:33:48,740 --> 02:33:50,850
second, for the entire
next week and

3315
02:33:50,850 --> 02:33:52,505
summarize that for you.

3316
02:33:52,505 --> 02:33:55,990
So you can see here that you
can take any of these lines

3317
02:33:55,990 --> 02:33:58,080
and they run every
three minutes.

3318
02:33:58,080 --> 02:34:01,225
So that makes taking public
transit so much easier.

3319
02:34:01,225 --> 02:34:07,400
[APPLAUSE]

3320
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:09,960
BERNI SEEFELD: And if you want
more details, you can use our

3321
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:11,795
new schedule viewer.

3322
02:34:11,795 --> 02:34:19,070
[APPLAUSE]

3323
02:34:19,070 --> 02:34:20,200
BERNI SEEFELD: So the
kids, they don't

3324
02:34:20,200 --> 02:34:21,190
want to walk too much.

3325
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:23,540
So I'm looking for a trip that
has less walking and less

3326
02:34:23,540 --> 02:34:25,810
transfers even if it
takes a bit longer.

3327
02:34:25,810 --> 02:34:29,710
And, here, that looks
like a great one.

3328
02:34:29,710 --> 02:34:33,708
So this is the future of
getting directions.

3329
02:34:33,708 --> 02:34:40,630
[APPLAUSE]

3330
02:34:40,630 --> 02:34:42,590
JONAH JONES: Now, as Brian
talked about earlier, we've

3331
02:34:42,590 --> 02:34:44,370
collected tons of imagery.

3332
02:34:44,370 --> 02:34:46,770
And we made a real focus of the
design to make sure it's

3333
02:34:46,770 --> 02:34:49,610
easy and fun to explore.

3334
02:34:49,610 --> 02:34:51,940
BERNI SEEFELD: So my friends,
they're from Rome, and so they

3335
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:54,620
insist that next time I
come and visit them.

3336
02:34:54,620 --> 02:34:57,040
So let's take a trip.

3337
02:34:57,040 --> 02:34:58,910
So this is a really nice
3D model of the

3338
02:34:58,910 --> 02:35:00,860
Saint Peter's Basilica.

3339
02:35:00,860 --> 02:35:02,700
But can we have a more
realistic view?

3340
02:35:02,700 --> 02:35:08,178

3341
02:35:08,178 --> 02:35:15,660
[APPLAUSE]

3342
02:35:15,660 --> 02:35:16,980
BERNI SEEFELD: No plug-ins.

3343
02:35:16,980 --> 02:35:18,270
No downloads.

3344
02:35:18,270 --> 02:35:20,070
This is the Google
Earth experience

3345
02:35:20,070 --> 02:35:23,366
right here on a browser.

3346
02:35:23,366 --> 02:35:28,156
[APPLAUSE]

3347
02:35:28,156 --> 02:35:29,800
BERNI SEEFELD: And
that's not all.

3348
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:32,390
You see those row of images
at the bottom.

3349
02:35:32,390 --> 02:35:34,850
These are other great
views of that area.

3350
02:35:34,850 --> 02:35:37,420
That makes it really
easy to explore.

3351
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:40,290
And the beauty of this place
is really on the inside.

3352
02:35:40,290 --> 02:35:41,540
So let's go on a tour.

3353
02:35:41,540 --> 02:35:49,799

3354
02:35:49,799 --> 02:35:56,620
[APPLAUSE]

3355
02:35:56,620 --> 02:35:58,620
BERNI SEEFELD: This is a
3D photo tour that is

3356
02:35:58,620 --> 02:36:01,700
automatically generated from
user uploaded photos.

3357
02:36:01,700 --> 02:36:04,570
So it will only get
better and better.

3358
02:36:04,570 --> 02:36:07,485
So let's head back
to San Francisco.

3359
02:36:07,485 --> 02:36:11,080
So this is the Moscone center
from a skydiver's perspective.

3360
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:14,790

3361
02:36:14,790 --> 02:36:17,740
But before the keynote started
I came up here on stage.

3362
02:36:17,740 --> 02:36:20,510
And with the camera up on my
Android phone, I took a photo

3363
02:36:20,510 --> 02:36:23,210
sphere and submitted
it to Google Maps.

3364
02:36:23,210 --> 02:36:24,460
And there it is.

3365
02:36:24,460 --> 02:36:28,398

3366
02:36:28,398 --> 02:36:35,290
[APPLAUSE]

3367
02:36:35,290 --> 02:36:38,176
BERNI SEEFELD: This is how you
guys look from up here.

3368
02:36:38,176 --> 02:36:41,230
So everybody can upload a photo
sphere and submit it to

3369
02:36:41,230 --> 02:36:42,110
Google Maps.

3370
02:36:42,110 --> 02:36:45,350
And so it's like user generated
street view.

3371
02:36:45,350 --> 02:36:46,430
And we also took a
photo sphere out

3372
02:36:46,430 --> 02:36:47,680
there on our geo pod.

3373
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:49,940

3374
02:36:49,940 --> 02:36:52,460
And if you go there tomorrow
morning, we'll have

3375
02:36:52,460 --> 02:36:53,660
[INAUDIBLE].

3376
02:36:53,660 --> 02:36:54,950
And you can get the experience
you just

3377
02:36:54,950 --> 02:36:58,704
saw with elite motion.

3378
02:36:58,704 --> 02:37:02,050
[APPLAUSE]

3379
02:37:02,050 --> 02:37:03,300
BERNI SEEFELD: Let's
get back out.

3380
02:37:03,300 --> 02:37:05,400

3381
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:07,620
So we jump back out.

3382
02:37:07,620 --> 02:37:11,420
And as we're zooming out and
we're leaving the Earth's

3383
02:37:11,420 --> 02:37:17,399
atmosphere, you can see
the whole world.

3384
02:37:17,399 --> 02:37:23,550
[APPLAUSE]

3385
02:37:23,550 --> 02:37:27,234
BERNI SEEFELD: And those clouds,
they're real time.

3386
02:37:27,234 --> 02:37:36,010
[APPLAUSE]

3387
02:37:36,010 --> 02:37:37,671
BERNI SEEFELD: But we
can go further.

3388
02:37:37,671 --> 02:37:42,000
[LAUGHTER]

3389
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:47,070
BERNI SEEFELD: This is the Earth
traveling through space.

3390
02:37:47,070 --> 02:37:49,053
And you can see the stars
and the milky way

3391
02:37:49,053 --> 02:37:51,130
at the right position.

3392
02:37:51,130 --> 02:37:54,170
And as the sun sets behind
the earth, the

3393
02:37:54,170 --> 02:37:56,630
night lights come out.

3394
02:37:56,630 --> 02:38:00,872
And this is the future
of Google Maps.

3395
02:38:00,872 --> 02:38:13,072
[APPLAUSE]

3396
02:38:13,072 --> 02:38:15,150
BRIAN MCCLENDON: Berni, Jonah,
this is beautiful.

3397
02:38:15,150 --> 02:38:16,700
Now, when are we going
to get this?

3398
02:38:16,700 --> 02:38:19,600
How long is it going to take
for you to deliver?

3399
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:21,300
BERNI SEEFELD: I don't think
these people want to wait.

3400
02:38:21,300 --> 02:38:23,154
BRIAN MCCLENDON: Do you
guys want to wait?

3401
02:38:23,154 --> 02:38:24,120
AUDIENCE: No.

3402
02:38:24,120 --> 02:38:26,410
BERNI SEEFELD: Well, you
can try this today.

3403
02:38:26,410 --> 02:38:28,390
This is the new Google Maps.

3404
02:38:28,390 --> 02:38:30,660
It has a preview
on the desktop.

3405
02:38:30,660 --> 02:38:33,758
So it's the perfect thing to
try to with your new Pixel.

3406
02:38:33,758 --> 02:38:42,954
[APPLAUSE]

3407
02:38:42,954 --> 02:38:45,685
BERNI SEEFELD: So when you pick
it up, check your inbox

3408
02:38:45,685 --> 02:38:47,710
and you will have an invite.

3409
02:38:47,710 --> 02:38:52,290
And everybody else, please go to
maps.google.com/preview and

3410
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:54,190
sign up and we'll
send the first

3411
02:38:54,190 --> 02:38:57,100
invites tomorrow morning.

3412
02:38:57,100 --> 02:38:58,580
BRIAN MCCLENDON: Thank
you very much,

3413
02:38:58,580 --> 02:39:00,540
Berni, Jonah, and Daniel.

3414
02:39:00,540 --> 02:39:04,470
[APPLAUSE]

3415
02:39:04,470 --> 02:39:06,520
BRIAN MCCLENDON: So that is
the future of Google Maps,

3416
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:10,540
data, APIs, a beautiful new
Google Maps for mobile coming

3417
02:39:10,540 --> 02:39:13,250
in the summer, and a desktop
Maps coming to

3418
02:39:13,250 --> 02:39:15,500
you in the room today.

3419
02:39:15,500 --> 02:39:17,750
So with that, I'd like to think
the geo team and all the

3420
02:39:17,750 --> 02:39:18,850
people who have worked on
this because it has

3421
02:39:18,850 --> 02:39:20,220
been incredibly hard.

3422
02:39:20,220 --> 02:39:22,570
But with that, the future
of Google Maps.

3423
02:39:22,570 --> 02:39:24,146
Thank you.

3424
02:39:24,146 --> 02:39:53,080
[APPLAUSE]

3425
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:57,680
LARRY PAGE: It was actually a
while ago I asked for the

3426
02:39:57,680 --> 02:40:00,040
picture of the earth at night.

3427
02:40:00,040 --> 02:40:03,680
And I'm really excited to
finally have gotten it.

3428
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:05,770
Although, I'm still waiting,
actually, for a higher

3429
02:40:05,770 --> 02:40:07,020
resolution.

3430
02:40:07,020 --> 02:40:09,510

3431
02:40:09,510 --> 02:40:11,750
So let's give a big around of
applause to the Maps guys.

3432
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:13,100
I think this is amazing.

3433
02:40:13,100 --> 02:40:22,430
[APPLAUSE]

3434
02:40:22,430 --> 02:40:23,950
LARRY PAGE: I'm really
excited to be here.

3435
02:40:23,950 --> 02:40:28,530
And first I want to start
with a story.

3436
02:40:28,530 --> 02:40:31,190
I was very, very lucky
growing up.

3437
02:40:31,190 --> 02:40:37,090
And I was thinking about this as
we were preparing for this

3438
02:40:37,090 --> 02:40:39,150
Google I/O.

3439
02:40:39,150 --> 02:40:42,110
My dad was really interested
in technology.

3440
02:40:42,110 --> 02:40:46,360
And I was just remembering he
actually drove me and my

3441
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:50,060
family all the way across the
country to go to a robotics

3442
02:40:50,060 --> 02:40:51,850
conference.

3443
02:40:51,850 --> 02:40:56,120
And then we got there and he
thought it was so important

3444
02:40:56,120 --> 02:41:00,840
that his young son go to the
conference and one of the few

3445
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:04,130
times I've seen him really argue
with someone to get in

3446
02:41:04,130 --> 02:41:07,850
someone underage successfully
into the conference.

3447
02:41:07,850 --> 02:41:10,010
And that was me.

3448
02:41:10,010 --> 02:41:14,590
And one of the themes I just
want to talk to you about is

3449
02:41:14,590 --> 02:41:19,630
how important it is for us, all
of the developers here in

3450
02:41:19,630 --> 02:41:22,980
the room and watching, to really
focus on technology and

3451
02:41:22,980 --> 02:41:26,350
get more people involved
in it.

3452
02:41:26,350 --> 02:41:31,410
And also thinking about my dad,
his degree, he was lucky

3453
02:41:31,410 --> 02:41:36,140
enough to get a degree in
communications sciences.

3454
02:41:36,140 --> 02:41:37,520
And you might ask
what the heck is

3455
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:39,720
communication sciences?

3456
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:42,440
That's what they called
computer science when

3457
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:46,590
computers were a passing fad.

3458
02:41:46,590 --> 02:41:49,120
Sounds kind of funny
now, right?

3459
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:52,401
But there was a time
when that was true.

3460
02:41:52,401 --> 02:41:56,880
And I think everyone today is
excited about technology.

3461
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:58,960
We don't have to worry about
that so much anymore.

3462
02:41:58,960 --> 02:42:01,740

3463
02:42:01,740 --> 02:42:04,290
And I think that Android and
things like that are being

3464
02:42:04,290 --> 02:42:10,180
adopted much faster than
anything else in the past.

3465
02:42:10,180 --> 02:42:13,490
I look at the rate of adoption
of those things, on almost any

3466
02:42:13,490 --> 02:42:16,840
basis they are much,
much faster.

3467
02:42:16,840 --> 02:42:20,170
And it's incredible.

3468
02:42:20,170 --> 02:42:23,576
When I pull out my smartphone,
it's amazing what we have on

3469
02:42:23,576 --> 02:42:25,080
the smartphones.

3470
02:42:25,080 --> 02:42:29,540
We have almost every sensor
we've ever come up with.

3471
02:42:29,540 --> 02:42:34,790
I recently got a scale and it
measures air quality and

3472
02:42:34,790 --> 02:42:36,670
uploads it to the internet.

3473
02:42:36,670 --> 02:42:40,000
I'm sure those things will end
up in your smartphone.

3474
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,140
That's amazing.

3475
02:42:42,140 --> 02:42:46,430
Your phone can talk to anyone
in the world almost anywhere

3476
02:42:46,430 --> 02:42:48,140
in the world.

3477
02:42:48,140 --> 02:42:52,030
And I was kind of remarking, I
was talking to my teams about

3478
02:42:52,030 --> 02:42:57,310
this, if you take out your phone
and hold it out, it's

3479
02:42:57,310 --> 02:43:01,080
almost as big as the TV or
screen you're looking at.

3480
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:04,660
And it has the same resolution
as well.

3481
02:43:04,660 --> 02:43:08,050
And so if you're nearsighted,
which I see many of you out

3482
02:43:08,050 --> 02:43:09,920
there with glasses &mdash;

3483
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:12,980
and even some Google
Glasses, thank you.

3484
02:43:12,980 --> 02:43:15,510
I think many of you
are near sighted.

3485
02:43:15,510 --> 02:43:17,600
And, you know, smartphone and a
big display are kind of the

3486
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:21,270
same thing now, which is
amazing, absolutely amazing.

3487
02:43:21,270 --> 02:43:24,270

3488
02:43:24,270 --> 02:43:27,240
So I think we also have a lot
more devices that we use

3489
02:43:27,240 --> 02:43:28,960
interchangeably.

3490
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:34,180
You know, we use tablets,
phones, laptops, and even the

3491
02:43:34,180 --> 02:43:37,840
Google Glass, all those
things we're using.

3492
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:42,320
And that's why we put so much
focus on our platforms, on

3493
02:43:42,320 --> 02:43:45,630
Android and Chrome.

3494
02:43:45,630 --> 02:43:51,400
It's really important in helping
developers and Google

3495
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:54,670
build great user experiences
across these different devices

3496
02:43:54,670 --> 02:43:56,950
to have these platforms.

3497
02:43:56,950 --> 02:44:01,200
And I'm tremendously excited
about all the innovation that

3498
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:03,950
you're bringing to life.

3499
02:44:03,950 --> 02:44:08,090
Technology should do the hard
work so that people can get on

3500
02:44:08,090 --> 02:44:12,830
with doing the things that make
them happiest in life.

3501
02:44:12,830 --> 02:44:15,590
Take Search for example.

3502
02:44:15,590 --> 02:44:18,940
Perfect search engine, as Amit
mentioned, is the Star Trek

3503
02:44:18,940 --> 02:44:19,790
computer, right?

3504
02:44:19,790 --> 02:44:23,990
And understand exactly what you
meant and give you exactly

3505
02:44:23,990 --> 02:44:25,710
what you wanted.

3506
02:44:25,710 --> 02:44:28,860
And our Knowledge Graph, which
you saw, really brings that a

3507
02:44:28,860 --> 02:44:30,110
lot closer.

3508
02:44:30,110 --> 02:44:32,820

3509
02:44:32,820 --> 02:44:36,360
I think Google Now, which
Johanna just demonstrated,

3510
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:40,610
gives you information without
even having to ask and it

3511
02:44:40,610 --> 02:44:45,840
understands the context of what
you talked about before

3512
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:47,220
so you can use things
like pronouns.

3513
02:44:47,220 --> 02:44:48,860
It's amazing.

3514
02:44:48,860 --> 02:44:52,950
Flight times, your boarding
passes, directions, next

3515
02:44:52,950 --> 02:44:55,500
appointment, all
with no effort.

3516
02:44:55,500 --> 02:44:59,310
Think about a really smart
assistant doing all those

3517
02:44:59,310 --> 02:45:02,520
things for you so you don't
have to think about it.

3518
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:06,630
You saw how easy some of
those experiences felt.

3519
02:45:06,630 --> 02:45:09,790
And we're just getting
started.

3520
02:45:09,790 --> 02:45:12,095
The opportunities we have
are tremendous.

3521
02:45:12,095 --> 02:45:15,140
You know, we haven't seen this
rate of change in computing

3522
02:45:15,140 --> 02:45:17,930
for a long time, probably
not since the

3523
02:45:17,930 --> 02:45:21,430
birth of personal computing.

3524
02:45:21,430 --> 02:45:25,090
But when I think about it, I
think we're all here because

3525
02:45:25,090 --> 02:45:30,660
we share a deep sense of
optimism about the potential

3526
02:45:30,660 --> 02:45:35,760
of technology to improve
people's lives and the world

3527
02:45:35,760 --> 02:45:38,230
as part of that.

3528
02:45:38,230 --> 02:45:40,190
And I'm amazed.

3529
02:45:40,190 --> 02:45:44,040
Every day I come to work the
list of things that needs to

3530
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:47,070
be done is longer than
the day before.

3531
02:45:47,070 --> 02:45:49,870
And the opportunity
of those things is

3532
02:45:49,870 --> 02:45:52,770
bigger than it was before.

3533
02:45:52,770 --> 02:45:56,930
And because of that, I think
we, as Google, and as an

3534
02:45:56,930 --> 02:46:01,980
industry, all of you, are really
only at 1% of what's

3535
02:46:01,980 --> 02:46:05,890
possible and probably
even less than that.

3536
02:46:05,890 --> 02:46:10,600
And despite the faster change we
have in the industry, we're

3537
02:46:10,600 --> 02:46:13,480
still moving slow
relative to the

3538
02:46:13,480 --> 02:46:17,520
opportunities that we have.

3539
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:20,020
And some of that I think is
due to the negativity.

3540
02:46:20,020 --> 02:46:22,980
You know, every story I read
about Google is kind of us

3541
02:46:22,980 --> 02:46:27,090
versus some other company
or some stupid thing.

3542
02:46:27,090 --> 02:46:29,940
And I just don't find that
very interesting.

3543
02:46:29,940 --> 02:46:31,340
We should be building
great things that

3544
02:46:31,340 --> 02:46:33,236
don't exist, right?

3545
02:46:33,236 --> 02:46:41,840
[APPLAUSE]

3546
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:42,870
LARRY PAGE: You know,
being negative is

3547
02:46:42,870 --> 02:46:44,880
not how we make progress.

3548
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:49,610
And most important things
are not zero sum.

3549
02:46:49,610 --> 02:46:52,480
There's a lot of opportunity
out there.

3550
02:46:52,480 --> 02:46:57,750
And we can use technology to
make really new and really

3551
02:46:57,750 --> 02:47:01,780
important things that make
people's lives better.

3552
02:47:01,780 --> 02:47:07,310
And if I think back to a long
time ago, a very long time

3553
02:47:07,310 --> 02:47:13,170
ago, all of humanity was
basically our farming or

3554
02:47:13,170 --> 02:47:15,225
hunting all the time.

3555
02:47:15,225 --> 02:47:17,730

3556
02:47:17,730 --> 02:47:21,050
And if you lived at that time
you probably hoped that you

3557
02:47:21,050 --> 02:47:23,110
could feed your family.

3558
02:47:23,110 --> 02:47:25,720
And, unfortunately, that's still
true for a lot of people

3559
02:47:25,720 --> 02:47:27,220
in the world.

3560
02:47:27,220 --> 02:47:30,160
But certainly for us we don't
worry about that.

3561
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:32,400
And the reason for that
is technology.

3562
02:47:32,400 --> 02:47:36,350
We've improved how we
grow food and so on.

3563
02:47:36,350 --> 02:47:40,130
And the technology of that has
allowed people to focus on

3564
02:47:40,130 --> 02:47:42,520
other things if they choose.

3565
02:47:42,520 --> 02:47:45,190
By the way, I think being a
farmer's great if that's what

3566
02:47:45,190 --> 02:47:47,080
you want to do.

3567
02:47:47,080 --> 02:47:49,900
But it's not great if that's
what you have to do.

3568
02:47:49,900 --> 02:47:53,160
And that's what technology
lets us do is free up

3569
02:47:53,160 --> 02:47:56,460
ourselves to do more
different things.

3570
02:47:56,460 --> 02:48:00,620
And I'm sure that people in the
future will think we're

3571
02:48:00,620 --> 02:48:05,340
just as crazy as we think
everyone in the past was at

3572
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:07,700
having to do things
like farming and

3573
02:48:07,700 --> 02:48:09,920
hunting all the time.

3574
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:12,520
So to give an example
of this Sergey and I

3575
02:48:12,520 --> 02:48:14,330
talk a lot about cars.

3576
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:17,130
You know, he's working on
automated cars now.

3577
02:48:17,130 --> 02:48:22,250
And imagine how self driving
cars will change our lives and

3578
02:48:22,250 --> 02:48:23,830
the landscape.

3579
02:48:23,830 --> 02:48:27,220
More green space, fewer
parking lots, greater

3580
02:48:27,220 --> 02:48:32,560
mobility, fewer accidents,
more freedom, fewer hours

3581
02:48:32,560 --> 02:48:36,350
wasted behind the
wheel of a car.

3582
02:48:36,350 --> 02:48:39,670
And the average American
probably spends almost 50

3583
02:48:39,670 --> 02:48:43,540
minutes, five, zero
minutes commuting.

3584
02:48:43,540 --> 02:48:47,130
Imagine if you got most of
that time back to use for

3585
02:48:47,130 --> 02:48:49,150
other things.

3586
02:48:49,150 --> 02:48:52,140
And, unfortunately, even in
other countries commute times

3587
02:48:52,140 --> 02:48:55,380
are still pretty large, not
quite as large as the US, but

3588
02:48:55,380 --> 02:48:58,280
still very significant.

3589
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:03,940
Now to get there we need more
people, more people like you,

3590
02:49:03,940 --> 02:49:08,950
markets falling in love with
science and math at school,

3591
02:49:08,950 --> 02:49:10,960
more students graduating with
science and engineering

3592
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:14,540
degrees, and more people
working on important

3593
02:49:14,540 --> 02:49:19,760
technological problems.

3594
02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:23,920
And it's why Google got involved
with the movie "The

3595
02:49:23,920 --> 02:49:26,660
Internship."

3596
02:49:26,660 --> 02:49:28,660
I'm not sure we entirely
had a choice.

3597
02:49:28,660 --> 02:49:31,240
But they were making a movie.

3598
02:49:31,240 --> 02:49:32,990
We decided it would be
good to get involved.

3599
02:49:32,990 --> 02:49:34,780
Lorraine's upfront.

3600
02:49:34,780 --> 02:49:37,210
She's really responsible
for that.

3601
02:49:37,210 --> 02:49:40,280
And I think the reason why we
got involved in that is that

3602
02:49:40,280 --> 02:49:44,110
computer science has a
marketing problem.

3603
02:49:44,110 --> 02:49:46,490
Where the nerdy curmudgeons.

3604
02:49:46,490 --> 02:49:49,640
I don't know about you,
but that's what I am.

3605
02:49:49,640 --> 02:49:54,500
And, well, in this movie the
guy who plays the head of

3606
02:49:54,500 --> 02:49:59,270
search, the Amit Singhal you
just saw, is by far the

3607
02:49:59,270 --> 02:50:01,900
coolest character
in the movie.

3608
02:50:01,900 --> 02:50:05,020
And we're really excited
about that.

3609
02:50:05,020 --> 02:50:11,050
So I think today we're still
just scratching the surface of

3610
02:50:11,050 --> 02:50:13,360
what's possible.

3611
02:50:13,360 --> 02:50:16,390
That's why I'm so excited.

3612
02:50:16,390 --> 02:50:18,930
Google's really working on the
platforms that support all of

3613
02:50:18,930 --> 02:50:20,840
your innovations.

3614
02:50:20,840 --> 02:50:24,970
I cannot wait to see
what comes next.

3615
02:50:24,970 --> 02:50:27,080
I got goosebumps as I was
watching some of the

3616
02:50:27,080 --> 02:50:28,890
presentations here.

3617
02:50:28,890 --> 02:50:33,290
And I really want to thank you
for all of your contributions.

3618
02:50:33,290 --> 02:50:35,550
So with that, I'm going to
do something kind of

3619
02:50:35,550 --> 02:50:39,510
unconventional and try to take
some questions, actually, from

3620
02:50:39,510 --> 02:50:40,180
all of you.

3621
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:45,060
So I've got two microphones set
up towards the back here.

3622
02:50:45,060 --> 02:50:45,740
And don't be shy.

3623
02:50:45,740 --> 02:50:48,860
Line up and ask some
questions.

3624
02:50:48,860 --> 02:50:50,080
I'm sure some of you
have thought

3625
02:50:50,080 --> 02:50:51,840
of some good questions.

3626
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:52,990
And we'll get started.

3627
02:50:52,990 --> 02:50:55,489
So thank you so much.

3628
02:50:55,489 --> 02:51:06,610
[APPLAUSE]

3629
02:51:06,610 --> 02:51:07,750
LARRY PAGE: All right, so
we got a few racing up.

3630
02:51:07,750 --> 02:51:10,130
Please line up so we can get
through them quickly.

3631
02:51:10,130 --> 02:51:13,040
And one question per
person, please.

3632
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:17,150
We have 6,000 people.

3633
02:51:17,150 --> 02:51:20,700
I also want to call out the
one million people.

3634
02:51:20,700 --> 02:51:24,880
It's over one million people
watching this live on YouTube.

3635
02:51:24,880 --> 02:51:26,560
It's just unbelievable.

3636
02:51:26,560 --> 02:51:29,103
So let's thank them
for participating.

3637
02:51:29,103 --> 02:51:35,730
[APPLAUSE]

3638
02:51:35,730 --> 02:51:37,920
LARRY PAGE: OK, yes, sir,
on the left here.

3639
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:40,650
AUDIENCE: I'm Robert Scobler,
one of the first Glass-holes.

3640
02:51:40,650 --> 02:51:41,830
So thank you.

3641
02:51:41,830 --> 02:51:42,720
LARRY PAGE: Yeah.

3642
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:43,940
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
getting my glass.

3643
02:51:43,940 --> 02:51:46,820
LARRY PAGE: Robert, I really
didn't appreciate the shower

3644
02:51:46,820 --> 02:51:48,656
picture though.

3645
02:51:48,656 --> 02:51:52,560
[LAUGHTER]

3646
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:55,940
AUDIENCE: Here at Google I/O
several contextual things

3647
02:51:55,940 --> 02:51:57,270
start coming out.

3648
02:51:57,270 --> 02:52:00,890
We start seeing an API that's
going to tell us whether we're

3649
02:52:00,890 --> 02:52:02,680
walking or running or whatnot.

3650
02:52:02,680 --> 02:52:04,890
Where are you going to take that
in the future now that we

3651
02:52:04,890 --> 02:52:06,250
have more sensors?

3652
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:08,290
And are you going to talk about
the little sensor inside

3653
02:52:08,290 --> 02:52:12,455
the Google Glass that
watches our eye?

3654
02:52:12,455 --> 02:52:13,730
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, that's
a great question.

3655
02:52:13,730 --> 02:52:15,270
I mean, this is a big
area of focus.

3656
02:52:15,270 --> 02:52:19,710
I think you saw that in
the presentations.

3657
02:52:19,710 --> 02:52:25,190
I think really being able to get
computers out of the way

3658
02:52:25,190 --> 02:52:28,220
and really focused on what
people really need.

3659
02:52:28,220 --> 02:52:31,990
Mobile's been a great learning
experience, I think, for us

3660
02:52:31,990 --> 02:52:33,660
and for all of you.

3661
02:52:33,660 --> 02:52:35,130
You know, the smaller
screens, you can't

3662
02:52:35,130 --> 02:52:37,070
have all this clutter.

3663
02:52:37,070 --> 02:52:41,240
I think you saw on the new
Google Maps how we got all

3664
02:52:41,240 --> 02:52:43,630
sorts of stuff out of the way.

3665
02:52:43,630 --> 02:52:47,460
There's like 100 times less
things on the screen than

3666
02:52:47,460 --> 02:52:49,120
there was before.

3667
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:51,450
And I think that's
going to happen

3668
02:52:51,450 --> 02:52:53,250
with all of your devices.

3669
02:52:53,250 --> 02:52:55,480
They're going to understand
the context.

3670
02:52:55,480 --> 02:52:58,710
Just before I came on stage,
I had to turn off all of my

3671
02:52:58,710 --> 02:53:02,790
phones so I'm not interrupting
all of you.

3672
02:53:02,790 --> 02:53:04,470
That's crazy.

3673
02:53:04,470 --> 02:53:06,850
That's not a very hard
thing to figure out.

3674
02:53:06,850 --> 02:53:11,040
So all that context that's in
your life, all these different

3675
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:13,770
sensors are going to now pick
that up and just make your

3676
02:53:13,770 --> 02:53:15,090
life better.

3677
02:53:15,090 --> 02:53:17,780
And I think that we're, again,
only at the very, very early

3678
02:53:17,780 --> 02:53:19,030
stages of that.

3679
02:53:19,030 --> 02:53:20,760
This is very, very exciting.

3680
02:53:20,760 --> 02:53:21,790
All right, let's take
another question.

3681
02:53:21,790 --> 02:53:22,720
Yes.

3682
02:53:22,720 --> 02:53:23,650
AUDIENCE: Hello, Larry.

3683
02:53:23,650 --> 02:53:24,420
My name is Buckner.

3684
02:53:24,420 --> 02:53:28,700
I have the opportunity to work
at Mozilla on a lot of the web

3685
02:53:28,700 --> 02:53:31,410
technologies with you
guys here at Google.

3686
02:53:31,410 --> 02:53:35,490
And I saw a lot of the great web
technologies you had here

3687
02:53:35,490 --> 02:53:36,520
on display.

3688
02:53:36,520 --> 02:53:39,430
And I know people had this
question leading up to Google

3689
02:53:39,430 --> 02:53:43,490
I/O. But are we ever going to
see the web upleveled in

3690
02:53:43,490 --> 02:53:48,090
Android or subsume what is there
now to be the operating

3691
02:53:48,090 --> 02:53:51,930
system of mobile and
your platform?

3692
02:53:51,930 --> 02:53:52,120
LARRY PAGE: Sorry.

3693
02:53:52,120 --> 02:53:54,410
You're asking about the
future or the web?

3694
02:53:54,410 --> 02:53:54,780
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

3695
02:53:54,780 --> 02:53:55,880
Are we going to see it &mdash;

3696
02:53:55,880 --> 02:53:57,540
I mean, Android right
now runs on Java.

3697
02:53:57,540 --> 02:53:58,230
It's a native platform.

3698
02:53:58,230 --> 02:54:00,065
It's great in a lot of ways.

3699
02:54:00,065 --> 02:54:02,140
Are we going to see the web
and all the fantastic

3700
02:54:02,140 --> 02:54:04,080
technologies you showed
off here today be

3701
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:05,960
the center of that?

3702
02:54:05,960 --> 02:54:07,270
LARRY PAGE: Well, I think we've
been really excited

3703
02:54:07,270 --> 02:54:08,930
about the web, obviously,
being birthed

3704
02:54:08,930 --> 02:54:11,650
from it as a company.

3705
02:54:11,650 --> 02:54:13,990
And I think that &mdash;

3706
02:54:13,990 --> 02:54:16,150
and we've really invested a
lot in the open standards

3707
02:54:16,150 --> 02:54:17,830
behind all that.

3708
02:54:17,830 --> 02:54:21,540
I've personally been quite sad
at the industry's behavior

3709
02:54:21,540 --> 02:54:24,020
around all these things.

3710
02:54:24,020 --> 02:54:29,240
If you just take something as
simple as instant messaging,

3711
02:54:29,240 --> 02:54:31,770
we've kind of had an offer
forever that we'll

3712
02:54:31,770 --> 02:54:34,440
interoperate on instant
messaging.

3713
02:54:34,440 --> 02:54:37,390
I think just this week Microsoft
took advantage of

3714
02:54:37,390 --> 02:54:42,400
that by interoperating with us
but not doing the reverse,

3715
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:45,190
which is really sad, right?

3716
02:54:45,190 --> 02:54:47,630
And that's not the way
to make progress.

3717
02:54:47,630 --> 02:54:50,910
You need to actually have
interoperation, not just

3718
02:54:50,910 --> 02:54:54,820
people milking off one company
for their own benefit.

3719
02:54:54,820 --> 02:54:58,130
So I think Google has always
stood for that.

3720
02:54:58,130 --> 02:55:02,050
I've been sad that the industry
hasn't been able to

3721
02:55:02,050 --> 02:55:06,110
advance those things, I think,
generally because of a focus

3722
02:55:06,110 --> 02:55:11,010
on negativity and on
zero sum games.

3723
02:55:11,010 --> 02:55:13,850
So we try to be on the right
side of all those things.

3724
02:55:13,850 --> 02:55:17,300
But we also try to be practical
and look at what

3725
02:55:17,300 --> 02:55:21,760
other people are doing and not
just rely on our principles to

3726
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:25,930
shoot ourselves in the foot and
our users in the process.

3727
02:55:25,930 --> 02:55:30,260
So I don't know how to deal
with all those things.

3728
02:55:30,260 --> 02:55:34,760
And I'm sad that the web is
probably not advancing as fast

3729
02:55:34,760 --> 02:55:35,930
as it should be.

3730
02:55:35,930 --> 02:55:39,020
We certainly struggle with
people like Microsoft.

3731
02:55:39,020 --> 02:55:43,870
We've had a great relationship
with Mozilla, I think, and

3732
02:55:43,870 --> 02:55:47,000
value that deeply.

3733
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,700
I'd like to see more open
standards, more people getting

3734
02:55:49,700 --> 02:55:54,680
behind things that just work and
more companies involved in

3735
02:55:54,680 --> 02:55:56,015
those ecosystems.

3736
02:55:56,015 --> 02:56:00,860
I think that's why this
conference is so important.

3737
02:56:00,860 --> 02:56:04,570
But I wouldn't grade the
industry well in terms of

3738
02:56:04,570 --> 02:56:06,770
where we've gotten to.

3739
02:56:06,770 --> 02:56:09,790
In the very long term, I don't
think you should have to think

3740
02:56:09,790 --> 02:56:14,920
about as a developer am I
developing for this platform

3741
02:56:14,920 --> 02:56:17,140
or another or something
like that.

3742
02:56:17,140 --> 02:56:20,150
I think you should be able to
work at a much higher level.

3743
02:56:20,150 --> 02:56:25,990
In software you should run
everywhere easily.

3744
02:56:25,990 --> 02:56:29,400
And people like Mozilla should
be able to add meaningfully to

3745
02:56:29,400 --> 02:56:32,710
that and make platforms
and other things.

3746
02:56:32,710 --> 02:56:34,220
So that's how I would
think about.

3747
02:56:34,220 --> 02:56:34,390
AUDIENCE: Thank.

3748
02:56:34,390 --> 02:56:36,260
LARRY PAGE: It's a very,
very complex an

3749
02:56:36,260 --> 02:56:38,480
important question though.

3750
02:56:38,480 --> 02:56:39,350
Yes, yes.

3751
02:56:39,350 --> 02:56:40,230
Yes, mam.

3752
02:56:40,230 --> 02:56:42,780
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
from Colombia.

3753
02:56:42,780 --> 02:56:47,960
And the only reason because I
didn't quite finish my law

3754
02:56:47,960 --> 02:56:50,490
studies was thanks to Google.

3755
02:56:50,490 --> 02:56:54,970
So I have dreamed in this
question many times.

3756
02:56:54,970 --> 02:57:01,870
And I would like to ask you how
Google will let us protect

3757
02:57:01,870 --> 02:57:05,670
our freedom of speech
through internet.

3758
02:57:05,670 --> 02:57:07,380
Thank you.

3759
02:57:07,380 --> 02:57:08,550
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, that's
a great question.

3760
02:57:08,550 --> 02:57:09,720
I mean, I think &mdash;

3761
02:57:09,720 --> 02:57:10,668
yeah.

3762
02:57:10,668 --> 02:57:15,930
[APPLAUSE]

3763
02:57:15,930 --> 02:57:17,210
LARRY PAGE: I mean, this is
part of the area where

3764
02:57:17,210 --> 02:57:18,540
business gets interesting,
right?

3765
02:57:18,540 --> 02:57:23,975
I think we at Google pretty
clearly have a strong desire

3766
02:57:23,975 --> 02:57:28,310
for freedom of speech for free
flow of information.

3767
02:57:28,310 --> 02:57:32,730
And one of the main things we do
is probably translate that

3768
02:57:32,730 --> 02:57:38,160
into practice in hundreds of
countries around the world and

3769
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:42,040
make sure we're talking to
government leaders and making

3770
02:57:42,040 --> 02:57:43,950
sure we're helping
advance that.

3771
02:57:43,950 --> 02:57:46,920
And our chairman, Eric Schmidt,
has been kind of

3772
02:57:46,920 --> 02:57:49,450
traveling the world talking
about that.

3773
02:57:49,450 --> 02:57:54,720
And I really applaud those
efforts and thinking about.

3774
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:57,790
So we're working very hard on
that, making sure we're

3775
02:57:57,790 --> 02:58:01,230
protecting your private
information, making sure that

3776
02:58:01,230 --> 02:58:06,580
we're ensuring computer
security, which is required to

3777
02:58:06,580 --> 02:58:09,330
make sure we're protecting your
freedom of speech and

3778
02:58:09,330 --> 02:58:14,540
your private information as part
of that and making sure

3779
02:58:14,540 --> 02:58:17,640
we're being as transparent as
we can about the requests we

3780
02:58:17,640 --> 02:58:19,710
get from government and
things like that.

3781
02:58:19,710 --> 02:58:22,420
So this is a big area
of focus for us.

3782
02:58:22,420 --> 02:58:26,380
And hopefully we can do a lot to
help the world and move it

3783
02:58:26,380 --> 02:58:27,590
along there.

3784
02:58:27,590 --> 02:58:31,580
It's a very difficult and
important issue also.

3785
02:58:31,580 --> 02:58:33,950
Yes, another great question.

3786
02:58:33,950 --> 02:58:35,920
AUDIENCE: I'm Ryan
from Provo, Utah.

3787
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:39,170
Just recently Google Fiber
was announced for there.

3788
02:58:39,170 --> 02:58:42,340
And part of the marketing
campaign is 100 times the

3789
02:58:42,340 --> 02:58:44,430
speed, 100 times the
possibility.

3790
02:58:44,430 --> 02:58:49,640
What do you see as the
possibilities from that fast

3791
02:58:49,640 --> 02:58:51,100
of internet?

3792
02:58:51,100 --> 02:58:53,410
LARRY PAGE: Well, I think from
an engineering point of view

3793
02:58:53,410 --> 02:58:56,400
it's just kind of
a no brainer.

3794
02:58:56,400 --> 02:58:59,080
I mean, we got started building
data centers.

3795
02:58:59,080 --> 02:59:02,280
And one of the biggest
problems we have was

3796
02:59:02,280 --> 02:59:04,680
networking in the
data centers.

3797
02:59:04,680 --> 02:59:08,790
And so I guess has a computer
scientist I just view it as

3798
02:59:08,790 --> 02:59:13,240
kind of sad we have all these
computers out there and

3799
02:59:13,240 --> 02:59:16,190
they're connected to each other
through like a tiny,

3800
02:59:16,190 --> 02:59:21,310
tiny, tiny, tiny little pipe
that's super slow.

3801
02:59:21,310 --> 02:59:24,080
And so in a sense, all the
computers we have in the

3802
02:59:24,080 --> 02:59:28,320
world, most of them are
in people's houses.

3803
02:59:28,320 --> 02:59:32,220
Most of them can't be used
for anything useful.

3804
02:59:32,220 --> 02:59:37,460
So it's a obviously ways to
go from where we are now.

3805
02:59:37,460 --> 02:59:39,810
We don't really have software
that's designed to use those

3806
02:59:39,810 --> 02:59:41,240
things yet.

3807
02:59:41,240 --> 02:59:45,770
We know if we build that
capacity, we'll be able to use

3808
02:59:45,770 --> 02:59:48,450
those computers for all sorts
of interesting things.

3809
02:59:48,450 --> 02:59:52,360
And even basic things like the
bandwidth of your visual

3810
02:59:52,360 --> 02:59:55,170
system is pretty high
compared to the

3811
02:59:55,170 --> 02:59:56,930
bandwidth most people have.

3812
02:59:56,930 --> 02:59:59,800
And It think it's pretty clear
we want to deliver bits to

3813
02:59:59,800 --> 03:00:03,080
your eyes just as
a basic thing.

3814
03:00:03,080 --> 03:00:06,920
So I'm really excited about what
we'll be able to do and

3815
03:00:06,920 --> 03:00:10,910
what you'll all be able to do
as we get more people with

3816
03:00:10,910 --> 03:00:13,120
super high speed connections.

3817
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:17,220
And probably gigabits or just
the beginning for that.

3818
03:00:17,220 --> 03:00:20,120
What we really need are low
latency connections that

3819
03:00:20,120 --> 03:00:24,570
operate at computer speed,
whatever that is that you have

3820
03:00:24,570 --> 03:00:26,210
inside your house.

3821
03:00:26,210 --> 03:00:29,280
So I'm really excited
about that.

3822
03:00:29,280 --> 03:00:30,490
So we're just getting started.

3823
03:00:30,490 --> 03:00:32,060
All right, in the middle now.

3824
03:00:32,060 --> 03:00:33,048
Yes.

3825
03:00:33,048 --> 03:00:35,388
The black shirt there.

3826
03:00:35,388 --> 03:00:36,810
AUDIENCE: I'm [INAUDIBLE]

3827
03:00:36,810 --> 03:00:38,560
from Vancouver.

3828
03:00:38,560 --> 03:00:41,990
We've seen Google move into
some physical real world

3829
03:00:41,990 --> 03:00:46,820
products like Google Fiber and
the autonomous self driving

3830
03:00:46,820 --> 03:00:50,130
cars and their renewable energy
cheaper than coal

3831
03:00:50,130 --> 03:00:51,800
initiatives.

3832
03:00:51,800 --> 03:00:54,970
Curious if you can elaborate
on further projects that

3833
03:00:54,970 --> 03:00:58,770
Google is planning to get into
regarding physical world type

3834
03:00:58,770 --> 03:01:00,010
initiatives.

3835
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:00,710
LARRY PAGE: Yeah.

3836
03:01:00,710 --> 03:01:06,060
Well, my compatriot, Sergey
Brin, who last year arranged

3837
03:01:06,060 --> 03:01:09,110
the sky diving, but
this year did not,

3838
03:01:09,110 --> 03:01:11,490
I mean, he's focused &mdash;

3839
03:01:11,490 --> 03:01:16,130
Google X is focused on real sort
of atoms and not bits.

3840
03:01:16,130 --> 03:01:20,650
And part of why I feel there's
a lot of opportunity there.

3841
03:01:20,650 --> 03:01:24,520
And Sergey's having a great
time doing that.

3842
03:01:24,520 --> 03:01:27,400
And that's, I think,
a really, really

3843
03:01:27,400 --> 03:01:29,870
fascinating an amazing job.

3844
03:01:29,870 --> 03:01:34,070
I think that possibilities for
some of those things are

3845
03:01:34,070 --> 03:01:35,320
incredibly great.

3846
03:01:35,320 --> 03:01:37,830

3847
03:01:37,830 --> 03:01:40,820
If you look at technology
applied to transportation, it

3848
03:01:40,820 --> 03:01:44,330
hasn't really started yet.

3849
03:01:44,330 --> 03:01:45,480
We haven't really
done that out.

3850
03:01:45,480 --> 03:01:49,230
So I think automated cars are
just one thing you could do.

3851
03:01:49,230 --> 03:01:50,865
You can do many, many
other things.

3852
03:01:50,865 --> 03:01:54,620
So I think we're very excited
about that area.

3853
03:01:54,620 --> 03:01:57,690
And we also think it's a way
that the company can scale.

3854
03:01:57,690 --> 03:02:00,530

3855
03:02:00,530 --> 03:02:03,380
I think that to the extent
all of our products are

3856
03:02:03,380 --> 03:02:07,780
interrelated, we actually need
to do a fair amount of

3857
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:10,440
management of those projects
to make sure you get a

3858
03:02:10,440 --> 03:02:15,360
seamless experience, both as a
user and a developer, that it

3859
03:02:15,360 --> 03:02:17,150
all makes sense.

3860
03:02:17,150 --> 03:02:19,500
When we do some of these other
kinds of things like automated

3861
03:02:19,500 --> 03:02:24,890
cars, they have a longer time
frame and less interaction.

3862
03:02:24,890 --> 03:02:29,420
And so I'd actually encourage
maybe more companies to try to

3863
03:02:29,420 --> 03:02:33,060
do things that are a little bit
outside their comfort zone

3864
03:02:33,060 --> 03:02:36,520
because I think it gets them
more scalability in what they

3865
03:02:36,520 --> 03:02:37,940
can get done.

3866
03:02:37,940 --> 03:02:43,750
And so I think we've been
surprised also even when we do

3867
03:02:43,750 --> 03:02:48,380
things that are kind of crazy
like automated cars, it turns

3868
03:02:48,380 --> 03:02:51,460
out you just saw the mapping
stuff we finished with.

3869
03:02:51,460 --> 03:02:54,370
The technology for doing mapping
and automated cars

3870
03:02:54,370 --> 03:02:56,760
turns out to be the same.

3871
03:02:56,760 --> 03:02:59,740
And so we have a bunch of great
engineers that have just

3872
03:02:59,740 --> 03:03:03,530
moved over from those efforts
and they did it naturally and

3873
03:03:03,530 --> 03:03:05,020
scalability.

3874
03:03:05,020 --> 03:03:06,760
And they're excited about it.

3875
03:03:06,760 --> 03:03:08,530
And so I'm really, really
excited about that too.

3876
03:03:08,530 --> 03:03:12,360
So every time we've done
something crazy &mdash;

3877
03:03:12,360 --> 03:03:15,500
Gmail, when we launched it, I
think we had 100 people in the

3878
03:03:15,500 --> 03:03:17,750
company when we launched
Gmail.

3879
03:03:17,750 --> 03:03:18,660
And people said, you're nuts.

3880
03:03:18,660 --> 03:03:20,230
You're a search company.

3881
03:03:20,230 --> 03:03:22,340
Why are you doing Gmail?

3882
03:03:22,340 --> 03:03:24,730
It's because we understand
things about data centers and

3883
03:03:24,730 --> 03:03:29,000
serving and storage that
we applied to email.

3884
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,120
And that was a great
thing we did that.

3885
03:03:31,120 --> 03:03:34,310
And so I think almost every
time we've tried to do

3886
03:03:34,310 --> 03:03:37,935
something crazy we've made
progress, not all the times

3887
03:03:37,935 --> 03:03:39,580
but almost every time.

3888
03:03:39,580 --> 03:03:42,780
So we've become a bit
emboldened by that.

3889
03:03:42,780 --> 03:03:46,120
And the good news is too, no
matter how much money we try

3890
03:03:46,120 --> 03:03:51,580
to spend on automated cars or
Gmail in the early stages,

3891
03:03:51,580 --> 03:03:54,670
they end up being small,
small chunks.

3892
03:03:54,670 --> 03:03:57,830
So they don't really cause
a business issue either.

3893
03:03:57,830 --> 03:03:59,550
So I'm really excited
about that.

3894
03:03:59,550 --> 03:04:03,260
And I tried to talk about
that in my remarks.

3895
03:04:03,260 --> 03:04:07,970
That's why I say I think we're
at 1% of what's possible.

3896
03:04:07,970 --> 03:04:09,290
Yeah, another question.

3897
03:04:09,290 --> 03:04:09,340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

3898
03:04:09,340 --> 03:04:10,300
Hi, Larry.

3899
03:04:10,300 --> 03:04:12,800
It's Greg with the D-Sky 9.

3900
03:04:12,800 --> 03:04:15,440
We're developing apps
for Google Glass.

3901
03:04:15,440 --> 03:04:19,550
And I was really excited to see
all the new things that

3902
03:04:19,550 --> 03:04:22,960
Google is providing and also
realize that it kind of

3903
03:04:22,960 --> 03:04:25,830
trounced a bunch of existing
businesses.

3904
03:04:25,830 --> 03:04:29,760
I was wondering if you could
speak to what you feel are the

3905
03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:34,050
largest area of opportunities
for developing on Glass

3906
03:04:34,050 --> 03:04:37,330
outside of what Google will
provide naturally.

3907
03:04:37,330 --> 03:04:41,020
And a bonus question, what will
be the production run for

3908
03:04:41,020 --> 03:04:43,262
Glass for consumers.

3909
03:04:43,262 --> 03:04:45,040
LARRY PAGE: Well, I mean, I'd
have to ask Sergey that.

3910
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:48,070

3911
03:04:48,070 --> 03:04:49,850
So I don't know what the
production numbers will be.

3912
03:04:49,850 --> 03:04:52,210
So I think we're more focused
on with Glass &mdash;

3913
03:04:52,210 --> 03:04:54,140
Glass is a new category.

3914
03:04:54,140 --> 03:04:58,420
It's quite different than
existing computing devices.

3915
03:04:58,420 --> 03:05:01,020
And so I think it's great that
we've started on it.

3916
03:05:01,020 --> 03:05:04,220
But I think our main
goal is to get

3917
03:05:04,220 --> 03:05:06,680
happy users using Glass.

3918
03:05:06,680 --> 03:05:09,780
And so we've put a bunch
out to developers.

3919
03:05:09,780 --> 03:05:13,190
I see a lot of people with
them in the audience.

3920
03:05:13,190 --> 03:05:16,370
We want to make sure we're
building experiences that

3921
03:05:16,370 --> 03:05:18,310
really make people happy.

3922
03:05:18,310 --> 03:05:21,250
And so the team has tried to
build the minimal set of

3923
03:05:21,250 --> 03:05:24,880
things, just for practical sake,
minimal set of things

3924
03:05:24,880 --> 03:05:27,970
that will provide a
great experience

3925
03:05:27,970 --> 03:05:29,950
and make happy users.

3926
03:05:29,950 --> 03:05:32,470
And then, you know, we can get
going and work on it for the

3927
03:05:32,470 --> 03:05:34,030
next 10 years.

3928
03:05:34,030 --> 03:05:37,840
And every successive one is
going to be better obviously.

3929
03:05:37,840 --> 03:05:42,830
So I think part of the answer
is we don't know.

3930
03:05:42,830 --> 03:05:45,700
I think the basic use
cases we have around

3931
03:05:45,700 --> 03:05:48,570
photography are amazing.

3932
03:05:48,570 --> 03:05:53,700
I love taking pictures my
kids with Glass and

3933
03:05:53,700 --> 03:05:55,420
movies and so on.

3934
03:05:55,420 --> 03:05:58,100
And I find that for
me that's enough.

3935
03:05:58,100 --> 03:05:59,560
I have the young kids.

3936
03:05:59,560 --> 03:06:03,510
For me that's enough reason
to have Glass just there.

3937
03:06:03,510 --> 03:06:06,160
I think if you didn't have young
kids you might not feel

3938
03:06:06,160 --> 03:06:07,860
exactly that way.

3939
03:06:07,860 --> 03:06:08,810
I'm not sure.

3940
03:06:08,810 --> 03:06:12,460
I have young kids,
so I can't tell.

3941
03:06:12,460 --> 03:06:14,700
Communications are also
pretty amazing.

3942
03:06:14,700 --> 03:06:16,600
Navigation is amazing.

3943
03:06:16,600 --> 03:06:18,930
Certainly if you're walking
if you're in

3944
03:06:18,930 --> 03:06:20,690
Manhattan or something.

3945
03:06:20,690 --> 03:06:23,940
Having Glass for navigation
is unbelievable.

3946
03:06:23,940 --> 03:06:25,910
I find it's really,
really nice.

3947
03:06:25,910 --> 03:06:30,120
And so navigations is amazing.

3948
03:06:30,120 --> 03:06:31,792
Some of the core experiences
we have are, I

3949
03:06:31,792 --> 03:06:33,440
think, pretty amazing.

3950
03:06:33,440 --> 03:06:38,800
Communications, phone
calls, SMS, voice.

3951
03:06:38,800 --> 03:06:41,100
You saw the things we're
doing around voice.

3952
03:06:41,100 --> 03:06:44,460
It's amazing to always have the
device there to do that.

3953
03:06:44,460 --> 03:06:46,640
So I think ultimately,
a lot of your

3954
03:06:46,640 --> 03:06:49,920
experiences can move to Glass.

3955
03:06:49,920 --> 03:06:52,560
And we're relying on all of you
to figure all that out.

3956
03:06:52,560 --> 03:06:56,390
We're trying to get the base
thing to make happy users so

3957
03:06:56,390 --> 03:06:58,690
we can get on with it.

3958
03:06:58,690 --> 03:06:59,540
AUDIENCE: We're aligned
with that.

3959
03:06:59,540 --> 03:06:59,770
Thank you.

3960
03:06:59,770 --> 03:07:01,890
LARRY PAGE: You're welcome.

3961
03:07:01,890 --> 03:07:02,710
Yes, over here.

3962
03:07:02,710 --> 03:07:05,900
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
is Caleb Allen.

3963
03:07:05,900 --> 03:07:10,020
And I was wondering what advice
you would give to the

3964
03:07:10,020 --> 03:07:14,640
rising generation of
technologists?

3965
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:20,530
What would help technology keep
moving at the pace it's

3966
03:07:20,530 --> 03:07:23,840
been moving at for the last
five or ten years?

3967
03:07:23,840 --> 03:07:27,820
And how would they do
that responsibly?

3968
03:07:27,820 --> 03:07:29,220
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, I mean,
that's a good question.

3969
03:07:29,220 --> 03:07:36,290
I think for me, I actually try
to use Google a lot and I

3970
03:07:36,290 --> 03:07:38,390
research things really deeply.

3971
03:07:38,390 --> 03:07:41,730
So, you know, before we get
something started, I try to

3972
03:07:41,730 --> 03:07:43,240
actually understand it.

3973
03:07:43,240 --> 03:07:47,130

3974
03:07:47,130 --> 03:07:49,560
And not just really understand
it, like, understand the crazy

3975
03:07:49,560 --> 03:07:51,700
people in the area.

3976
03:07:51,700 --> 03:07:52,870
And Google's great for that.

3977
03:07:52,870 --> 03:07:56,230
You can find the craziest person
in any given area.

3978
03:07:56,230 --> 03:08:00,670

3979
03:08:00,670 --> 03:08:03,910
And I think normally people
do not do that.

3980
03:08:03,910 --> 03:08:06,690
So I think you want to
think about the base

3981
03:08:06,690 --> 03:08:10,510
thing, whatever it is.

3982
03:08:10,510 --> 03:08:13,100
We've been, obviously, working
on smartphones a lot.

3983
03:08:13,100 --> 03:08:15,360
They're relatively
expensive now.

3984
03:08:15,360 --> 03:08:19,435
With Nexus 4 we tried to
improve that a bit.

3985
03:08:19,435 --> 03:08:21,470
But, you know, if you look at
the raw material costs of a

3986
03:08:21,470 --> 03:08:26,070
smartphone, I guess mostly glass
and silicon, tiny bit of

3987
03:08:26,070 --> 03:08:29,180
silicon, a little bit
of fibre glass.

3988
03:08:29,180 --> 03:08:30,710
I don't know, the raw materials
costs of it is

3989
03:08:30,710 --> 03:08:34,640
probably like $1 or something
like that.

3990
03:08:34,640 --> 03:08:40,990
I think Glass is $0.50 a pound
or something like that.

3991
03:08:40,990 --> 03:08:43,790
Certain metals are
$0.20 a pound.

3992
03:08:43,790 --> 03:08:46,320
Phones don't weigh
very much, right?

3993
03:08:46,320 --> 03:08:49,000
And silicon is very,
very cheap.

3994
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:52,810
So, I think, when I see people
in industries who are making

3995
03:08:52,810 --> 03:08:55,790
things, I ask this question,
like, how far are you off the

3996
03:08:55,790 --> 03:08:57,550
raw materials cost?

3997
03:08:57,550 --> 03:09:01,370
And they never know the answer
to that question.

3998
03:09:01,370 --> 03:09:05,300
So I think kind of as an
engineer or as a technologist

3999
03:09:05,300 --> 03:09:09,890
trying to go to first principles
and say, what is

4000
03:09:09,890 --> 03:09:13,830
the real issue?

4001
03:09:13,830 --> 03:09:15,970
What is the real issue around
our power grids?

4002
03:09:15,970 --> 03:09:18,810
Or what's the real issue
around manufacturing or

4003
03:09:18,810 --> 03:09:20,300
whatever it is?

4004
03:09:20,300 --> 03:09:23,880
I think people usually don't
answer those questions.

4005
03:09:23,880 --> 03:09:28,010
And as a result, most of the
work that's done is very

4006
03:09:28,010 --> 03:09:29,780
incremental.

4007
03:09:29,780 --> 03:09:35,040
And because of that, we don't
make the progress we need to.

4008
03:09:35,040 --> 03:09:37,180
With that said, I mean,
it's very hard.

4009
03:09:37,180 --> 03:09:40,260
If you're going to make a
smartphone for a dollar, $1, I

4010
03:09:40,260 --> 03:09:44,380
mean, that's obviously almost
impossible to do.

4011
03:09:44,380 --> 03:09:47,770
But I think if you took a 50
year time frame or something

4012
03:09:47,770 --> 03:09:51,260
like that, if you took a longer
view, you'd probably

4013
03:09:51,260 --> 03:09:54,010
start to make the investments
you needed to.

4014
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:56,670
And along the way you'd probably
figure out how to

4015
03:09:56,670 --> 03:09:57,890
make money.

4016
03:09:57,890 --> 03:10:02,170
So I'd just kind of encourage
non incremental thinking and a

4017
03:10:02,170 --> 03:10:06,920
real deep understanding of
whatever you're doing.

4018
03:10:06,920 --> 03:10:08,360
That's what I try to do.

4019
03:10:08,360 --> 03:10:09,640
Yeah, all the way over
on the right.

4020
03:10:09,640 --> 03:10:11,050
And then I'll make
another pass.

4021
03:10:11,050 --> 03:10:13,120
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the future of Android.

4022
03:10:13,120 --> 03:10:17,570
So with Oracle taking control
of Java seven forward.

4023
03:10:17,570 --> 03:10:21,020
How does Google and advance
Android when one of the core

4024
03:10:21,020 --> 03:10:25,590
technical underpinnings is not
necessarily in its control?

4025
03:10:25,590 --> 03:10:27,480
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, I mean,
we've had a difficult

4026
03:10:27,480 --> 03:10:32,600
relationship with Oracle,
including having to appear in

4027
03:10:32,600 --> 03:10:34,060
court as a result of it.

4028
03:10:34,060 --> 03:10:37,150

4029
03:10:37,150 --> 03:10:39,120
Again, I think we'd like
to have a cooperative

4030
03:10:39,120 --> 03:10:39,940
relationship with them.

4031
03:10:39,940 --> 03:10:43,280
That hasn't seemed possible.

4032
03:10:43,280 --> 03:10:47,360
And I think, again, probably
money is more important to

4033
03:10:47,360 --> 03:10:51,620
them than having any kind
of collaboration

4034
03:10:51,620 --> 03:10:53,120
or things like that.

4035
03:10:53,120 --> 03:10:55,950
So I think that's been
very difficult.

4036
03:10:55,950 --> 03:10:57,610
I think we'll get
through that.

4037
03:10:57,610 --> 03:11:00,280
And I think, obviously,
Android's very, very important

4038
03:11:00,280 --> 03:11:02,880
to the Java ecosystem.

4039
03:11:02,880 --> 03:11:06,350
And so we'll get through
that just fine, just

4040
03:11:06,350 --> 03:11:08,860
not in an ideal way.

4041
03:11:08,860 --> 03:11:14,085
[APPLAUSE]

4042
03:11:14,085 --> 03:11:15,810
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, another
question.

4043
03:11:15,810 --> 03:11:16,360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

4044
03:11:16,360 --> 03:11:17,510
My name is Prishan.

4045
03:11:17,510 --> 03:11:19,990
I'm an Android developer
from India.

4046
03:11:19,990 --> 03:11:21,130
I'm a heave Google user.

4047
03:11:21,130 --> 03:11:24,346
And most of my opinion,
actually, I can trace back to

4048
03:11:24,346 --> 03:11:25,950
a Google search.

4049
03:11:25,950 --> 03:11:28,740
And as we saw today, it's
become more and more

4050
03:11:28,740 --> 03:11:31,210
personalized and predictive.

4051
03:11:31,210 --> 03:11:34,300
I kind of worry that it kind
of enforce my worldview and

4052
03:11:34,300 --> 03:11:36,540
kind of rule out the
possibility of some

4053
03:11:36,540 --> 03:11:39,616
serendipitous discovery of
other side, you know?

4054
03:11:39,616 --> 03:11:41,470
So any comment on that?

4055
03:11:41,470 --> 03:11:44,500
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, that's a
really great question.

4056
03:11:44,500 --> 03:11:46,100
People have a lot of
concern about that.

4057
03:11:46,100 --> 03:11:50,280
I'm totally not worried
about that at all.

4058
03:11:50,280 --> 03:11:53,585
And it sounds kind
of funny to say.

4059
03:11:53,585 --> 03:11:56,450
But that's totally under
your control and

4060
03:11:56,450 --> 03:11:57,980
our control, as Google.

4061
03:11:57,980 --> 03:12:02,120
So I think it's very important
to have a kind of widened

4062
03:12:02,120 --> 03:12:06,780
world view, to have education,
all those kind of things.

4063
03:12:06,780 --> 03:12:11,080
But the right solution to
that is not randomness.

4064
03:12:11,080 --> 03:12:16,600
So you can't really argue doing
a bad job of returning

4065
03:12:16,600 --> 03:12:19,550
whatever you wanted is the
right way to educate you.

4066
03:12:19,550 --> 03:12:21,330
It's just not.

4067
03:12:21,330 --> 03:12:25,450
It'd be better to return exactly
what you wanted when

4068
03:12:25,450 --> 03:12:30,300
you wanted and use that saved
time to have you read the news

4069
03:12:30,300 --> 03:12:34,770
or read textbooks or books or
other things that might be

4070
03:12:34,770 --> 03:12:36,680
more general.

4071
03:12:36,680 --> 03:12:39,530
And we can put that into
the algorithms.

4072
03:12:39,530 --> 03:12:45,480
So I guess in my very long term
worldview, 50 years from

4073
03:12:45,480 --> 03:12:49,860
now or something, hopefully
our software understands

4074
03:12:49,860 --> 03:12:54,700
deeply what your knowledgeable
about, what you're not, and

4075
03:12:54,700 --> 03:12:58,850
how to organize the world so
that the world can solve

4076
03:12:58,850 --> 03:13:00,720
important problems.

4077
03:13:00,720 --> 03:13:03,320
You know, people are starting
in the world not because we

4078
03:13:03,320 --> 03:13:04,320
don't have enough food.

4079
03:13:04,320 --> 03:13:06,650
It's because we're
not organized

4080
03:13:06,650 --> 03:13:08,640
to solve that problem.

4081
03:13:08,640 --> 03:13:11,400
And our computers aren't
helping us do that.

4082
03:13:11,400 --> 03:13:14,470
So I think if you think about
it that way, if you think

4083
03:13:14,470 --> 03:13:18,280
about we need to make computer
software and the internet that

4084
03:13:18,280 --> 03:13:23,240
helps people solve important
problems in the world, that

4085
03:13:23,240 --> 03:13:27,440
will cause, as a side effect,
for people to be educated

4086
03:13:27,440 --> 03:13:31,020
about the things they should
get educated about.

4087
03:13:31,020 --> 03:13:33,180
And that's not the
same as a demand.

4088
03:13:33,180 --> 03:13:37,290
I'm asking for a particular
thing I'm searching for.

4089
03:13:37,290 --> 03:13:38,770
Those are different modes.

4090
03:13:38,770 --> 03:13:41,920
So just kind of make sure we're
serving both modes and

4091
03:13:41,920 --> 03:13:44,340
that computers can
help you do that.

4092
03:13:44,340 --> 03:13:48,940
So I can not be more optimistic
about that.

4093
03:13:48,940 --> 03:13:53,240
I think computers and software
and things that you all write

4094
03:13:53,240 --> 03:13:57,360
and we all write are going to
help us solve those problems

4095
03:13:57,360 --> 03:14:02,260
for people rather than just
doing it at random.

4096
03:14:02,260 --> 03:14:03,530
All right, next question.

4097
03:14:03,530 --> 03:14:04,310
AUDIENCE: Hi, Larry.

4098
03:14:04,310 --> 03:14:08,890
I'm Asman from GBG
[INAUDIBLE].

4099
03:14:08,890 --> 03:14:12,180
It's great that Google has
developed a lot of new

4100
03:14:12,180 --> 03:14:17,740
technologies and allows
us to live in a better

4101
03:14:17,740 --> 03:14:19,540
way that we are today.

4102
03:14:19,540 --> 03:14:21,140
My question is not
about technology.

4103
03:14:21,140 --> 03:14:23,370
It's just a basic question for
the developers and the

4104
03:14:23,370 --> 03:14:27,440
countries that I came from
in the Far East.

4105
03:14:27,440 --> 03:14:30,740
We developers have been
developing, trying to develop

4106
03:14:30,740 --> 03:14:31,300
applications.

4107
03:14:31,300 --> 03:14:35,990
But one of the main issue for us
in many of the GDGs is that

4108
03:14:35,990 --> 03:14:37,580
we can't sell.

4109
03:14:37,580 --> 03:14:38,670
That's one part.

4110
03:14:38,670 --> 03:14:43,740
The other thing is that I have
been asked many times why

4111
03:14:43,740 --> 03:14:47,230
can't we buy paid apps?

4112
03:14:47,230 --> 03:14:50,700
That's my simple questions.

4113
03:14:50,700 --> 03:14:54,860
It's a great opportunity to
voice this one out to you.

4114
03:14:54,860 --> 03:14:58,260
And I hope things can be done
because I don't see any reason

4115
03:14:58,260 --> 03:15:01,930
why because people
want to buy.

4116
03:15:01,930 --> 03:15:03,810
And they can use their
credit cards.

4117
03:15:03,810 --> 03:15:05,320
Thank you very much.

4118
03:15:05,320 --> 03:15:06,430
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, I mean,
that scenario we've

4119
03:15:06,430 --> 03:15:07,620
had huge focus on.

4120
03:15:07,620 --> 03:15:11,820
So I think we've made
a lot of progress.

4121
03:15:11,820 --> 03:15:13,420
I think we'll make a
lot more progress.

4122
03:15:13,420 --> 03:15:16,370
But hopefully that's a very
temporary problem and we'll

4123
03:15:16,370 --> 03:15:17,750
get through that quickly.

4124
03:15:17,750 --> 03:15:20,340
But thanks for bringing it up.

4125
03:15:20,340 --> 03:15:21,460
Yes.

4126
03:15:21,460 --> 03:15:24,810
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Kevin
Nielson from New Jersey.

4127
03:15:24,810 --> 03:15:28,770
And I was intrigued about your
comment about the positivity

4128
03:15:28,770 --> 03:15:30,140
and the negativity.

4129
03:15:30,140 --> 03:15:34,560
And I'm very interested in
helping other people be

4130
03:15:34,560 --> 03:15:37,540
positive about technology,
as you are.

4131
03:15:37,540 --> 03:15:41,980
And I'm interested in what your
advice would be to help

4132
03:15:41,980 --> 03:15:45,150
us sort of reduce the negativity
and focus on

4133
03:15:45,150 --> 03:15:49,770
positive and focus on
changing the world.

4134
03:15:49,770 --> 03:15:56,910
[APPLAUSE]

4135
03:15:56,910 --> 03:15:59,860
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

4136
03:15:59,860 --> 03:16:03,330
I think people naturally are
concerned about change.

4137
03:16:03,330 --> 03:16:05,640
And certainly not all
change is good.

4138
03:16:05,640 --> 03:16:09,130
And I do think the pace of
change in the world is

4139
03:16:09,130 --> 03:16:10,380
increasing.

4140
03:16:10,380 --> 03:16:12,240

4141
03:16:12,240 --> 03:16:15,200
Part of what I would think
about, I think, is I think

4142
03:16:15,200 --> 03:16:19,450
that we haven't adapted
mechanisms to deal with that.

4143
03:16:19,450 --> 03:16:24,990
And maybe some of our old
institutions, like the law and

4144
03:16:24,990 --> 03:16:28,540
so on, aren't keeping up with
the rate of change that we've

4145
03:16:28,540 --> 03:16:30,555
caused through technology.

4146
03:16:30,555 --> 03:16:33,060

4147
03:16:33,060 --> 03:16:35,900
If you look at different kinds
of laws we make or things like

4148
03:16:35,900 --> 03:16:37,730
that, they're very old.

4149
03:16:37,730 --> 03:16:43,260
I mean, the laws when we went
public were 50 years old.

4150
03:16:43,260 --> 03:16:46,590
The law can't be right if it's
50 years old, like, it's

4151
03:16:46,590 --> 03:16:47,900
before the internet.

4152
03:16:47,900 --> 03:16:51,760
That's a pretty major change
in how you might go public.

4153
03:16:51,760 --> 03:16:58,260
So I think maybe some of you
or maybe the million people

4154
03:16:58,260 --> 03:17:02,620
watching who love technology,
maybe more of us need to go

4155
03:17:02,620 --> 03:17:06,910
into other areas and help
those areas improve and

4156
03:17:06,910 --> 03:17:08,920
understand technology.

4157
03:17:08,920 --> 03:17:10,270
And I think that's not
happened at the

4158
03:17:10,270 --> 03:17:11,770
rate it needs to happen.

4159
03:17:11,770 --> 03:17:14,172
Yeah, thank you.

4160
03:17:14,172 --> 03:17:20,920
And the other thing in my mind
is we also haven't, maybe,

4161
03:17:20,920 --> 03:17:24,770
built mechanisms to allow
experimentation.

4162
03:17:24,770 --> 03:17:27,930
There's many, many exciting and
important things you could

4163
03:17:27,930 --> 03:17:31,430
do that you just can't do
because they're illegal or

4164
03:17:31,430 --> 03:17:33,620
they're not allowed
by regulation.

4165
03:17:33,620 --> 03:17:34,750
And that makes sense.

4166
03:17:34,750 --> 03:17:38,550
We don't want our world
to change too fast.

4167
03:17:38,550 --> 03:17:42,490
But maybe we should set aside
a small part of the world.

4168
03:17:42,490 --> 03:17:45,285
You know, I like going to
Burning Man, for example,

4169
03:17:45,285 --> 03:17:47,533
which I'm sure many of
you have been to.

4170
03:17:47,533 --> 03:17:49,505
[APPLAUSE].

4171
03:17:49,505 --> 03:17:51,790
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, a few
burners out there.

4172
03:17:51,790 --> 03:17:53,870
That's an environment
where people can try

4173
03:17:53,870 --> 03:17:55,180
out different things.

4174
03:17:55,180 --> 03:17:57,690
But not everybody has to go.

4175
03:17:57,690 --> 03:17:59,570
And I think that's a
great thing too.

4176
03:17:59,570 --> 03:18:04,060
I think as technologists we
should have some safe places

4177
03:18:04,060 --> 03:18:08,020
where we can try out some new
things and figure out what is

4178
03:18:08,020 --> 03:18:12,350
the effect on society, what's
the effect on people, without

4179
03:18:12,350 --> 03:18:16,100
having to deploy it kind of
into the normal world.

4180
03:18:16,100 --> 03:18:19,200
And people who like those kinds
of things can go there

4181
03:18:19,200 --> 03:18:21,070
and experience that.

4182
03:18:21,070 --> 03:18:23,200
And we don't have mechanisms
for that.

4183
03:18:23,200 --> 03:18:26,700
So those are the kind of things
I would think about.

4184
03:18:26,700 --> 03:18:28,060
I also think we need
to be honest.

4185
03:18:28,060 --> 03:18:31,200
And we don't always know
the impact of changes.

4186
03:18:31,200 --> 03:18:33,380
And we should be humble
about that.

4187
03:18:33,380 --> 03:18:36,770
I'm not sure getting up on stage
and saying everything is

4188
03:18:36,770 --> 03:18:40,290
amazing and so on is
the right thing.

4189
03:18:40,290 --> 03:18:42,870
Maybe we should launch things
in a little more humble way

4190
03:18:42,870 --> 03:18:48,210
and see what the effect
is an adapt as we go.

4191
03:18:48,210 --> 03:18:52,060
So those are kind
of my thoughts.

4192
03:18:52,060 --> 03:18:53,310
Yeah, way on the side here.

4193
03:18:53,310 --> 03:18:55,850

4194
03:18:55,850 --> 03:18:57,940
AUDIENCE: Larry, Ben Schacter,
Macquarie.

4195
03:18:57,940 --> 03:19:01,630
Health care impacts the society
in so many profound

4196
03:19:01,630 --> 03:19:03,090
ways and impacts the economy.

4197
03:19:03,090 --> 03:19:06,300
What are the strengths of Google
that you can bring to

4198
03:19:06,300 --> 03:19:08,330
help improve health care?

4199
03:19:08,330 --> 03:19:10,300
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, that's a
great, maybe, segue from the

4200
03:19:10,300 --> 03:19:11,950
previous question.

4201
03:19:11,950 --> 03:19:14,460
I think it's been difficult.

4202
03:19:14,460 --> 03:19:16,180
We had Google Health.

4203
03:19:16,180 --> 03:19:18,550
We didn't make much
progress on it.

4204
03:19:18,550 --> 03:19:21,870
And I think primarily we found
that all the issues were

4205
03:19:21,870 --> 03:19:23,120
regulatory.

4206
03:19:23,120 --> 03:19:24,880

4207
03:19:24,880 --> 03:19:28,660
It's very hard to get
technological leverage there.

4208
03:19:28,660 --> 03:19:32,050
So I was talking about we're
1% of where we can be.

4209
03:19:32,050 --> 03:19:35,235
That's by doing real amazing
technological things.

4210
03:19:35,235 --> 03:19:38,050

4211
03:19:38,050 --> 03:19:39,840
We found, certainly, in the
kinds of things we were

4212
03:19:39,840 --> 03:19:44,210
working on in health care, we
weren't able to move beyond

4213
03:19:44,210 --> 03:19:48,370
that due to all the constraints

4214
03:19:48,370 --> 03:19:50,060
that we were under.

4215
03:19:50,060 --> 03:19:54,280
And so I think we'll see amazing
things in health care.

4216
03:19:54,280 --> 03:19:57,020
But I think they'll be things
that have technological

4217
03:19:57,020 --> 03:20:00,100
leverage like DNA sequencing.

4218
03:20:00,100 --> 03:20:02,130
You know, we're clearly all
going to have that.

4219
03:20:02,130 --> 03:20:04,390
It's going to cost
$1 or whatever.

4220
03:20:04,390 --> 03:20:07,110
You're all going to have your
sequence and something amazing

4221
03:20:07,110 --> 03:20:08,820
will happen.

4222
03:20:08,820 --> 03:20:13,830
You know, I just disclosed
yesterday my voice issues.

4223
03:20:13,830 --> 03:20:16,480
I got so many great
emails from people

4224
03:20:16,480 --> 03:20:18,720
and thoughtful advice.

4225
03:20:18,720 --> 03:20:21,810
And I realized, you know, I had
the kind of notion, like,

4226
03:20:21,810 --> 03:20:23,980
this stuff should
be very private.

4227
03:20:23,980 --> 03:20:25,370
And at least in my
case, I feel I

4228
03:20:25,370 --> 03:20:28,300
should've done it sooner.

4229
03:20:28,300 --> 03:20:30,050
And I'm not sure that
that answer is not

4230
03:20:30,050 --> 03:20:31,530
true for most people.

4231
03:20:31,530 --> 03:20:35,890
So I ask, like, why are people
so focused on keeping your

4232
03:20:35,890 --> 03:20:38,160
medical history private?

4233
03:20:38,160 --> 03:20:40,900
And the answer is probably
insurance.

4234
03:20:40,900 --> 03:20:41,950
You're very worried
that you're going

4235
03:20:41,950 --> 03:20:44,560
to be denied insurance.

4236
03:20:44,560 --> 03:20:46,190
And that makes no sense.

4237
03:20:46,190 --> 03:20:50,240
And we should change the rules
around insurance so that they

4238
03:20:50,240 --> 03:20:51,950
have to insure people.

4239
03:20:51,950 --> 03:20:53,180
I mean, the whole point
of insurance is

4240
03:20:53,180 --> 03:20:54,966
that it insures everyone.

4241
03:20:54,966 --> 03:21:00,565
[APPLAUSE]

4242
03:21:00,565 --> 03:21:02,740
LARRY PAGE: So, again, maybe
we have a safe place where

4243
03:21:02,740 --> 03:21:05,850
people can go and live in a
world like that where they'd

4244
03:21:05,850 --> 03:21:07,480
make those kind of changes.

4245
03:21:07,480 --> 03:21:09,040
We can see if they work.

4246
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:11,700
And then the world can learn
from that and move on.

4247
03:21:11,700 --> 03:21:14,020
But not everybody has to
participate in that because

4248
03:21:14,020 --> 03:21:16,940
I'm worried we're not making
some of the fundamental

4249
03:21:16,940 --> 03:21:20,920
changes we need to
make fast enough.

4250
03:21:20,920 --> 03:21:22,200
All right, maybe one or
two more questions.

4251
03:21:22,200 --> 03:21:23,400
We're going to run
out of time.

4252
03:21:23,400 --> 03:21:24,580
Yeah.

4253
03:21:24,580 --> 03:21:27,126
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm John
Sarriugarte with Form &

4254
03:21:27,126 --> 03:21:30,430
reform, one of the Burning Man
artists you invited here

4255
03:21:30,430 --> 03:21:32,570
tonight for the after party.

4256
03:21:32,570 --> 03:21:33,120
Thank you.

4257
03:21:33,120 --> 03:21:35,170
LARRY PAGE: Oh, great,

4258
03:21:35,170 --> 03:21:38,420
AUDIENCE: I'm very inspired to
see that you've reached out to

4259
03:21:38,420 --> 03:21:40,690
the educational aspect.

4260
03:21:40,690 --> 03:21:42,600
I have a six-year-old.

4261
03:21:42,600 --> 03:21:45,580
Glad to see the Google's
moving that direction.

4262
03:21:45,580 --> 03:21:49,270
My question is about women in
the development community.

4263
03:21:49,270 --> 03:21:51,960
I'm looking around and I
don't see a lot here.

4264
03:21:51,960 --> 03:21:53,920
And I'd like to know
what we can do to

4265
03:21:53,920 --> 03:21:55,370
encourage women to be here.

4266
03:21:55,370 --> 03:22:00,280
[APPLAUSE]

4267
03:22:00,280 --> 03:22:02,270
AUDIENCE: It's a simple
question.

4268
03:22:02,270 --> 03:22:04,160
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, I mean, we've
been super focused on

4269
03:22:04,160 --> 03:22:05,410
that forever.

4270
03:22:05,410 --> 03:22:07,770

4271
03:22:07,770 --> 03:22:09,730
Sergey and I, when we were
interviewing people, we spent

4272
03:22:09,730 --> 03:22:12,850
a lot of time interviewing women
for that reason, trying

4273
03:22:12,850 --> 03:22:17,090
to make sure our company didn't
end up all male, which

4274
03:22:17,090 --> 03:22:18,655
I think is a really,
really bad thing.

4275
03:22:18,655 --> 03:22:22,960
So I think ultimately the only
answer is we have to start

4276
03:22:22,960 --> 03:22:26,990
early and make sure we're
getting more young women and

4277
03:22:26,990 --> 03:22:30,340
girls really excited
about technology.

4278
03:22:30,340 --> 03:22:33,380
And I think if we do that,
there's no question we'll more

4279
03:22:33,380 --> 03:22:36,730
than double the rate of progress
that we have in the

4280
03:22:36,730 --> 03:22:38,290
technology world.

4281
03:22:38,290 --> 03:22:40,140
So we all need to do that.

4282
03:22:40,140 --> 03:22:42,090
We're trying to help with
that in any way we can.

4283
03:22:42,090 --> 03:22:43,998
And thank you for
the question.

4284
03:22:43,998 --> 03:22:45,252
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

4285
03:22:45,252 --> 03:22:45,670
LARRY PAGE: Yeah.

4286
03:22:45,670 --> 03:22:46,920
All right, one more question.

4287
03:22:46,920 --> 03:22:49,440

4288
03:22:49,440 --> 03:22:51,750
AUDIENCE: Jefrey Siegal with
the University of Michigan.

4289
03:22:51,750 --> 03:22:55,250
While you had mentioned that
regulation is usually the

4290
03:22:55,250 --> 03:22:58,210
biggest problem trying to get
technology into health care,

4291
03:22:58,210 --> 03:23:01,060
I'm curious if you're going to
be doing anything with DNA

4292
03:23:01,060 --> 03:23:03,590
sequencing considering you
actually have all the

4293
03:23:03,590 --> 03:23:06,760
horsepower behind it, and also
image analysis, with things

4294
03:23:06,760 --> 03:23:09,470
like surgical slides and whatnot
because it seems like

4295
03:23:09,470 --> 03:23:12,060
that's a really big area that
we could get into to help

4296
03:23:12,060 --> 03:23:13,730
people as a whole.

4297
03:23:13,730 --> 03:23:15,500
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, I think those
are good questions.

4298
03:23:15,500 --> 03:23:16,990
I don't have anything to
announce at the time.

4299
03:23:16,990 --> 03:23:21,120
But we always look
at these areas.

4300
03:23:21,120 --> 03:23:23,920
We have felt it's a difficult
area for us to work in.

4301
03:23:23,920 --> 03:23:26,420
I think it's certainly
worth doing though.

4302
03:23:26,420 --> 03:23:27,210
All right, let's take one more.

4303
03:23:27,210 --> 03:23:28,460
Yes.

4304
03:23:28,460 --> 03:23:30,530

4305
03:23:30,530 --> 03:23:32,810
AUDIENCE: I'm Josh Constine,
Techcrunch.

4306
03:23:32,810 --> 03:23:36,030
Could you discuss Google's
plan for bringing the

4307
03:23:36,030 --> 03:23:39,820
developing world online and what
you see as the social,

4308
03:23:39,820 --> 03:23:42,560
cultural, and political impacts
of democratized access

4309
03:23:42,560 --> 03:23:43,780
to the internet?

4310
03:23:43,780 --> 03:23:45,640
LARRY PAGE: That's a really
great question.

4311
03:23:45,640 --> 03:23:48,100
One of the things I always talk
about in the company when

4312
03:23:48,100 --> 03:23:52,610
I talk to the company is that
smartphones are going to

4313
03:23:52,610 --> 03:23:55,340
basically be amazing
in these places.

4314
03:23:55,340 --> 03:23:59,570
And so you don't quite have
smartphones, for example,

4315
03:23:59,570 --> 03:24:02,510
going into India or
Africa because

4316
03:24:02,510 --> 03:24:04,710
they're just too expensive.

4317
03:24:04,710 --> 03:24:10,110
The average cost of a phone in
India is very, very cheap, $50

4318
03:24:10,110 --> 03:24:11,730
or $100 or less.

4319
03:24:11,730 --> 03:24:13,600
I think more like $50.

4320
03:24:13,600 --> 03:24:18,040
And I think that we need to make
sure that the prices of

4321
03:24:18,040 --> 03:24:22,360
what we all are using quickly
make it down to those levels.

4322
03:24:22,360 --> 03:24:23,850
And I think they will.

4323
03:24:23,850 --> 03:24:27,400
That'll be the smartphone you
have today two or three years

4324
03:24:27,400 --> 03:24:31,180
from now will be in
Africa and India.

4325
03:24:31,180 --> 03:24:35,690
And that will be amazing because
I find I try to mostly

4326
03:24:35,690 --> 03:24:38,610
use smartphones now
just to make sure

4327
03:24:38,610 --> 03:24:40,750
I'm living that future.

4328
03:24:40,750 --> 03:24:44,220
I find I can get almost
everything I need done.

4329
03:24:44,220 --> 03:24:46,910
Unfortunately I don't get
to program that much.

4330
03:24:46,910 --> 03:24:50,020
But I can do most things I need
to do to run the company

4331
03:24:50,020 --> 03:24:51,250
on my phone.

4332
03:24:51,250 --> 03:24:55,820
So I think that's pretty amazing
to think that that can

4333
03:24:55,820 --> 03:24:59,470
go to three billion, four
billion, five billion, six

4334
03:24:59,470 --> 03:25:03,830
billion, seven billion plus in
not very long period of time.

4335
03:25:03,830 --> 03:25:09,360
And I think people are
underestimating how fast

4336
03:25:09,360 --> 03:25:11,140
that's going to happen.

4337
03:25:11,140 --> 03:25:14,070
I think it's clearly going to
happen very, very quickly.

4338
03:25:14,070 --> 03:25:16,160
And I'm really, really
excited about that.

4339
03:25:16,160 --> 03:25:18,560
We're trying to help that
happen quicker.

4340
03:25:18,560 --> 03:25:20,250
But I'm very excited
about that.

4341
03:25:20,250 --> 03:25:23,540
So thank you all so much for
spending so much time.

4342
03:25:23,540 --> 03:25:32,790
[APPLAUSE]
