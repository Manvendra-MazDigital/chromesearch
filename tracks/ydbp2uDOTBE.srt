00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,742

2
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:03,200
MARY GROVE: Great.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,630
Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to our panel

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,290
discussion at Google I/O on
Lessons From Founders.

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,890
My name is Mary Grove, and I'm
the director of Google for

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,730
Entrepreneurs.

7
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,670
Google began as a startup in a
garage some 15 years ago, and

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,650
that spirit of entrepreneurship
is very much

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,225
a part of our DNA.

10
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:24,180
It is our team's mission to
empower the next generation of

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,640
startups to be successful
around the world.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,140
We created Google for
Entrepreneurs specifically as

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,130
a central resource to launch
programs and partnerships to

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,560
empower entrepreneurs
around the globe.

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,920
So as a team, we focus
on two things.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,650
The first is on building
community and fostering

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,540
entrepreneurship around
the world.

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,320
So we work with about 30
different accelerators and

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,480
incubators and co-working
spaces around the globe.

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,060
And the second thing we focus
on is on equipping

21
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,980
entrepreneurs with products and
technology that they need

22
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,660
to be successful in launching
and growing their businesses.

23
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,000
So we are very privileged and
lucky to work with and learn

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,410
from entrepreneurs in over 100
countries around the world.

25
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,330
You can learn more about
our programs at

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,160
google.com/entrepreneurs.

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,220
So today, we are very fortunate
to be joined by four

28
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,800
incredible startup founders and
serial entrepreneurs to

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,970
share with us their insights
and lessons that they've

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,130
learned along their journeys.

31
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,160
So let me please start by
introducing our panel.

32
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,770
First, please welcome
Slava Rubin.

33
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,290
Slava is the co-founder and CEO
of Indiegogo, the world's

34
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,180
largest global crowdfunding
platform.

35
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,100
Indiegogo distributes millions
of dollars across its platform

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,300
every week.

37
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,140
And they're really focused on
empowering individuals to

38
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,550
raise funds for any idea,
be it creative, be it

39
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,230
cause-related, or be
it entrepreneurial.

40
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,650
Slava recently attended the
White House signing of the

41
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,920
historic JOBS Act as a
representative of the

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,570
crowdfunding community, and he
also founded Music against

43
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,010
Myeloma, an annual charity
event to raise funds for

44
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,480
cancer awareness.

45
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,670
And we've had an opportunity to
partner closely with Slava

46
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,070
and his team over the last
couple years, and we're really

47
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,280
glad to welcome him
here today.

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,970
Next, it's my pleasure to
introduce Julia Hartz.

49
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,210
And Julia is the co-founder
and CEO of Eventbrite,

50
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,530
dedicated to democratizing
ticketing.

51
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,240
And they have transacted and
enabled the purchase of over

52
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,520
100 million tickets on the
Eventbrite platform.

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,270
Julia is focused on the
happiness and productivity and

54
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,740
the growth of the team at
Eventbrite, and she has

55
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,620
fostered a culture there that
has landed Eventbrite on the

56
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,200
list of the top five best places
to work in the Bay Area

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,540
for two consecutive years.

58
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,250
Before founding Eventbrite with
her husband Kevin, Julia

59
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,250
led TV development at MTV
Networks and FX Networks.

60
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,310
So welcome, Julia.

61
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,470
Next, please welcome Caterina
Fake, who is the founder and

62
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,800
CEO of Findery.

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,840
Findery is an augmented-reality
app which

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,330
makes places come alive
and launched in

65
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,270
public beta last October.

66
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,150
Prior to that, Caterina
co-founded Hunch, a search and

67
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,850
discovery engine that was
acquired by eBay in 2011.

68
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,010
And before that, she co-founded
the popular

69
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,570
photo-sharing site Flickr, which
Yahoo! acquired in 2005.

70
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,340
Caterina sits on the board of
Creative Commons and she

71
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,090
chairs the board of
directors of Etsy.

72
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,750
She was also named one of "Time
Magazine's" 100 most

73
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,590
influential people
in the world.

74
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,230
And please welcome
Mary Lou Jepsen.

75
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,020
Mary Lou is a serial
entrepreneur who has founded

76
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,380
or co-founded four different
startups, and she has served

77
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,940
as CEO or CTO, or both, for
all of them, including One

78
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,930
Laptop Per Child, Pixel Qi,
NY3D, and MicroDisplay Corp.

79
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,600
Mary Lou has really disrupted
the display industry, and she

80
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,250
is currently the head of the
display division at Google X.

81
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,550
Mary Lou has been a tenure-track
professor at MIT.

82
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,830
She was CTO of Intel's
display division.

83
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,680
She's been ranked in the top 50
female computer scientists

84
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,530
of all time by the Anita
Borg Institute.

85
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,420
And she also made "Time
Magazine's" list of 100 most

86
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,340
influential people
in the world.

87
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,700
So we are on the shoulders of
giants today, and looking

88
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,565
forward to a great discussion.

89
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:15,520
What we'll do is I will
kick it off with some

90
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,079
questions for our panel.

91
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,310
And in a while, we will turn
it over to the audience to

92
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,140
take some questions.

93
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,079
So start thinking
about them now.

94
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,650
We'll open up the floor to
questions in about 15 minutes.

95
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,570
So thank you all for joining
us, and welcome.

96
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,960
So we know today that the
web is democratizing

97
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,410
entrepreneurship
more than ever.

98
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,280
And there are new models and new
medias possible, more than

99
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,180
ever before.

100
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,140
So I'd like to start by asking
you each to spend a minute

101
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,920
helping us set the context.

102
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,540
Set the context of why now?

103
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,360
And for each of you, please
share the key insight with us

104
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,960
that really led you to develop
and disrupt the industries

105
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,570
that you're in, starting
with Slava.

106
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,470
SLAVA RUBIN: All right.

107
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,190
First, let me just say
it's a real honor

108
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,020
to be on this panel.

109
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,570
Just several years ago,
I went to I/O when it

110
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,520
was at Google campus.

111
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,660
And just to be here is
incredible, and obviously,

112
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,370
incredible panelists.

113
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,950
Indiegogo was from 2006.

114
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,130
There's two co-founders and
I, we got together.

115
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,050
Eric, Danae, and I were
overlooking the Golden Gate

116
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,110
Bridge and we were sharing
experiences of how frustrated

117
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,100
we are to try to use the
internet to raise money.

118
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,420
So if you could just go back
seven years to 2006, you have,

119
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,030
YouTube is not owned
by Google yet.

120
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,400
Twitter is nascent.

121
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,430
You have MySpace is way
bigger than Facebook.

122
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,210
And Obama is not a word
for most people.

123
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,640
And it was really difficult to
raise money using MySpace,

124
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,790
essentially, and Paypal.

125
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,760
And my dad died of cancer when
I was 15, and then 10 years

126
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,750
later, I decided to do something
about it for a New

127
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,210
Year's resolution, so
I started a charity.

128
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,680
And I wanted to use the
internet, because I thought I

129
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,180
was a little tech-savvy.

130
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,610
And it was very difficult.

131
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,140
Eric was on the board of a
theater company and he was

132
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,490
trying to raise money.

133
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,360
And Danae was working with
different filmmakers and

134
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,470
entrepreneurs.

135
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,690
We thought, huh, YouTube is
doing something interesting in

136
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,660
the media space, and there's
other companies that are

137
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,450
disrupting other spaces, like
eBay, and Prosper was new.

138
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,020
Why is it that the ultimate
democratization tool hasn't

139
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,740
really created access to
capital for anyone?

140
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,270
It is still all a gated
experience.

141
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,250
So we were actually completely
naive, and had not been

142
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,530
entrepreneurs before.

143
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,800
And we launched in
January 2008.

144
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,840
I would say that there's a lot
of myths out there as to how

145
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,200
you need to become an
entrepreneur, whether it is

146
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,620
you need to have a lot of
money to start off with.

147
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,300
Whether it is that you need to
have a perfect marketing plan.

148
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,850
You need to have a really
good business plan.

149
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,500
You need to have done
a lot of research.

150
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,770
I think the barriers to entry
are so low that you could so

151
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,790
quickly be able to identify
whether or not you could gain

152
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,680
traction and move fast in
whatever direction you can go,

153
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,970
based on data.

154
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,110
And that is something that 20
years ago, you used a business

155
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,720
plan to get that feedback.

156
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,770
Hey, professor, what do you
think of my business plan?

157
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,900
Then give me feedback.

158
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,210
Now you can actually very
quickly use your business plan

159
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,190
online, which is actually just
right away getting validation

160
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,280
from the market.

161
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,290
A perfect example of that, and
I'll end here, is we just

162
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,150
actually had &mdash;

163
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,090
the company that got second
place at CES for most

164
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,420
innovative new product was
founded on Indiegogo, the

165
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,140
Misfit Shine.

166
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,960
And they raised nearly
$1 million and

167
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,620
this was just an idea.

168
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,460
And it was an idea that
VCs weren't sure if

169
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,840
they wanted to fund.

170
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,730
And it's just so interesting
now, how it's becoming very

171
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,110
validated and it's going
out to the market.

172
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,030
And we balanced that with things
like the first ever

173
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,800
crowd-funded baby.

174
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,235
Yeah.

175
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:46,520
[LAUGHTER]

176
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,350
SLAVA RUBIN: The couple was not
able to get insurance as

177
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,690
needed, and they were able to
get the in vitro fertilization

178
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,990
funded through the public.

179
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,160
Or you have Oscar award-winners
from just this

180
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,530
last February.

181
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,560
So I think it's a great time
to really press forward and

182
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,320
have other thoughts.

183
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,600
JULIA HARTZ: Wow, I wish I would
have thought about that,

184
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,256
crowdfunded baby.

185
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:10,543
Could you do that retroactively,
or no?

186
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:11,250
SLAVA RUBIN: What's that?

187
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,950
JULIA HARTZ: Can you do that
retroactively, or?

188
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,190
SLAVA RUBIN: You could try.

189
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,270
JULIA HARTZ: So I'm the
co-founder and president of

190
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,980
Eventbrite, and I started
Eventbrite with my now

191
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,230
husband, who was my fiance,
and our third co-founder,

192
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,990
Renaud Visage.

193
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,730
And I wanted to echo some of the
sentiments that Slava had

194
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,310
about what you need
to get started.

195
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,710
And I think that what we did
in the beginning was we

196
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,809
started with the notion that
we really did want to

197
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,240
democratize an industry by
harnessing the power of

198
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,309
technology.

199
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,580
And I think that what
we thought about

200
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,419
back then, in 2007 &mdash;

201
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,180
which seems like so long ago &mdash;

202
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,850
was that everybody was thinking
about the future and

203
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,040
about the proliferation of our
online world, and how we'd be

204
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,670
living in a more
virtual world.

205
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,040
And over the course of a few
years, that our entire world

206
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,680
would be completely online, and
that we would move farther

207
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,200
and farther away from personal
relationships.

208
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,910
And our thesis was that
actually, you could use

209
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:11,010
technology and the social graph,
really, to bring people

210
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,170
together offline easier.

211
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,160
And I think what we've seen
happen is just that.

212
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,860
I think that going back to those
early days, the three of

213
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,590
us, we bootstrapped
the company.

214
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,090
We didn't need many resources
to test this theory out.

215
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,720
We needed a community that liked
to get together, which

216
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,720
just so happened to be the tech
community, of all places.

217
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,070
And we needed to build
a great product.

218
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,950
And so we are very heads-down on
what mattered to us, which

219
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,620
was truly just the product
and our customer.

220
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,830
And it was like that
for four years.

221
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,650
And I think that when I look
back at when we did actually

222
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,470
end up raising money, we knew
a lot about ourselves.

223
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,540
And we also knew a lot about
what was happening in the tech

224
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,770
world, what was happening with
social, what was happening

225
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,640
with mobile, what was on
the horizon for data.

226
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,230
And that helped us understand
how powerful this product that

227
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,670
we had built could be.

228
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,910
And it helped us, obviously,
raise money quite quickly at

229
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,450
that point.

230
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:12,390
And so from a very small germ
of an idea and, really, no

231
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,850
money, we are able to set
our own pace and test

232
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,490
this theory over time.

233
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,890
And I think what comes to mind
today is when you think about

234
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,280
how you spend your time &mdash;

235
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,340
whether it be at a conference
like Google I/O, or at a

236
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,070
festival, or running
an obstacle race &mdash;

237
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,320
those offline experiences are
incredibly powerful, because

238
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,200
those are indelible memories.

239
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,980
And while we're capturing
memories on our Google

240
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,870
Glasses, those are the types
of things at these offline

241
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,950
experiences that you're never
going to quite forget as

242
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,150
easily as a newsfeed article
that you read.

243
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,210
And so I think we're really
understanding the power of the

244
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,170
live experience, which
hopefully, you guys are all

245
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,420
experiencing today.

246
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,350

247
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,240
CATERINA FAKE: Is this on?

248
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,970
Ah, now it is.

249
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:06,870
I'm very jealous of the
four-year, is it, kind of

250
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,690
startup path.

251
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,290
I've tried to do that, but I
always went broke before the

252
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,580
four years were out.

253
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,890
I'm in many ways an accidental
entrepreneur.

254
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,830
I am someone who always loved
computers, but I was an

255
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:28,280
English major, and I studied
art, and I was interested in

256
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,770
other things.

257
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,510
But one thing I think is common
to me and probably

258
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,630
everybody on this panel and any
entrepreneurs in the room

259
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,920
is that you are the kind
of person that sees the

260
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,360
possibility in things.

261
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,390
And you can't help but, when
you're out in the world, see

262
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,820
things that need fixing, or
problems that need solving, or

263
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,330
ways that you could help.

264
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:57,470
And also a sense that you
could build this thing.

265
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,390
That you could make
this thing.

266
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,720
That if you just kind of sit
down at your computer and

267
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,060
start coding, you can actually
build something that can

268
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,530
change the lives of people.

269
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,580
And this is, I think, kind of
where the impulse comes from.

270
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,700
And until I was in my mid-30s,
I didn't self-identify as an

271
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,590
entrepreneur.

272
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,080
And yet if I looked at all of
the things that I had done, I

273
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,130
was always a starter.

274
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,240
I was always kind of a person
who just developed things in

275
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,680
my spare time and just hacked
on stuff at night and on

276
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,780
weekends, when I
wasn't at work.

277
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,510
And that is, I think,
where the strong

278
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,100
tendency has come from.

279
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,640
In all of the companies that
I've built, including my

280
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,210
current one, my last one, the
first one, all of them &mdash;

281
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,280
the ones that nobody's even
heard about and the ones that

282
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,320
failed miserably or were lost
in the sands of time &mdash;

283
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,590
those kind of came from that
same general impulse.

284
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,040
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Why now?

285
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,360
I just started a new effort at
Google X, and I can't talk

286
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,990
much about it.

287
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:06,010
By why now, there, is there's
in some sense, at Google X,

288
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,970
it's a bit like the hardware
division of Google.

289
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,080
And there's no more silicon
in Silicon Valley.

290
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,920
It's all iPhone apps
and whatever.

291
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,590
Nexus apps, and so forth.

292
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,810
[LAUGHTER]

293
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,130
But I love hardware.

294
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,220
I loved flashing colored lights
as a kid, and I just

295
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,160
kept going with that.

296
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,490
So I did a lot of art in
electrical engineering and

297
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,860
optics and things like that.

298
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,770
So that, for me, came together
in displays.

299
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,140
And I used to make really,
really expensive things,

300
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,080
one-of-a-kind things.

301
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,990
Designed a system to project
video on the moon for all of

302
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,450
humanity to see.

303
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:45,130
And I decided, wow,
democratization, this stuff

304
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,440
was happening about 10 years
ago in cellular technology.

305
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,210
And I thought, how do we get
data to all the people of the

306
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,050
world, not just the
rich people?

307
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,760
So I was lucky enough to meet
Nicholas Negroponte and start

308
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,170
One Laptop Per Child with him.

309
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,130
And I became a &mdash;

310
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,340
I hadn't designed a laptop
before, but I designed the

311
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,600
$100 laptop.

312
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,610
And I got in an access to fabs
that nobody got access to at

313
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,900
the level that I did.

314
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,210
And I decided to start my next
company &mdash; again, I just always

315
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,310
think, well, we're alive.

316
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,290
How do we use the
time the best?

317
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,470
What can I do today?

318
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,200
And what's the sort of imprint,
the impact, that I

319
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,170
can contribute to?

320
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,770
So I started a company in 2008
called Pixel Qi, given the

321
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,140
access I've gotten, in a pretty
broken part of the

322
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,240
hardware industry, which is
the display industry.

323
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,520
Which runs on and off between
zero and negative 20% margin,

324
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,460
and has slashed pretty much all
R&D for the last 10 years.

325
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,830
So we're one of the few
organizations that's done some

326
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,560
innovative R&D in the
display industry.

327
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,020
And it's my belief that the
devices that we use, from the

328
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,820
smallest to the largest, are
pretty much, if you look from

329
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,910
a cost structure, a use
structure, and a power

330
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,620
structure , screens, given
the cloud has happened.

331
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,400
And so now, because it's
completely broken, the funding

332
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,060
models are completely
screwed up.

333
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,390
VCs used to have 30,
40 X routine.

334
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,750
Now they struggle with
one X routine.

335
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,190
Angel funding isn't sufficient
for hardware.

336
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,920
And I thought, roll up my
sleeves, figure it out.

337
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,850
So I moved to Asia and
learned Chinese

338
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,920
and was pretty effective.

339
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,382
But now I'm back in the Bay
Area, working for Sergey.

340
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:38,110
MARY GROVE: So great.

341
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,200
Thank you.

342
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,600
Just curious, a quick
show of hands.

343
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,540
How many entrepreneurs
in the room today?

344
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,670

345
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,610
About 50%.

346
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,090
How many aspiring
entrepreneurs?

347
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,210
Great, great.

348
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,400
Well, thanks for joining us.

349
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,250
So I'm going to turn quickly &mdash;
we often speak about the

350
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,890
importance of team, and how
that's just the most

351
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,230
fundamental part of a startup.

352
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,980
Julia, I'd love to ask you some
of your learnings and

353
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,880
experiences from building and
growing a team at Eventbrite

354
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,700
and fostering the culture
that has been clearly so

355
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,080
meaningful.

356
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,160
JULIA HARTZ: Well, first and
foremost, I can't stress

357
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,380
enough &mdash; especially since I
married to him &mdash; on how

358
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,660
important it is to find
the right partner.

359
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,420
I think that what we've
realized in building a

360
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,450
co-foundership while also being
married, we have to be

361
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,600
quite careful about where we
draw the lines and how we

362
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,850
divide and conquer.

363
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,500
But in hindsight now, seven
years later, I look back and

364
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,470
understand that this is a lesson
that all co-founders

365
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,660
should learn.

366
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,830
And that it starts with finding
the right partners.

367
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,170
And maybe they're not your
co-founders, but they're the

368
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,350
second people in line to you.

369
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,400
They're the people that rally
around your idea.

370
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,690
But those people should have
your best interests at heart,

371
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,460
or the best interest of what's
most important to you.

372
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,560
And also, they should have
complementary skills.

373
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,460
I think that the fact that Kevin
and I, our skills really

374
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,319
don't overlap, is such a
great advantage for us.

375
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,920
Because we're able to have this
incredible air cover now,

376
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,170
over a company that's 250 people
large, and that we

377
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,210
operate together on a
day-to-day basis.

378
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:18,579
And when I think about how lucky
we are to make all that

379
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,460
work, I truly feel fortunate.

380
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,369
But I also think that there's
some really specific lessons

381
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,010
in there for all co-founders.

382
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,589
And then team.

383
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,280
I mean, we have 21 minutes
and 15 seconds.

384
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,720
I could go on and
on about team.

385
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,230
But I think that when you get
to the point where you start

386
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,520
having people come on board,
you have to remember and be

387
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,910
humbled by the fact that they're
giving up their career

388
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,710
and livelihoods for your idea.

389
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,110
That they're putting their &mdash;

390
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,650
not giving up, I guess,
but they're putting

391
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,510
their careers at risk.

392
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,980
And I look around the
room every day and

393
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,570
I think about that.

394
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,600
And it humbles me, because I
think there's something so

395
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,960
powerful about being able to
get somebody excited about

396
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,630
your vision.

397
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,420
And it still very much
feels like our vision

398
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,520
is just this idea.

399
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,920
And it's sort of this
harebrained idea, and I can't

400
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,520
believe that so many people
would believe in that idea,

401
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,600
and come and sit alongside us
and fight the battles that

402
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,540
we're fighting with us.

403
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,560
And so I think coming from that
humble perspective of

404
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,170
understanding how incredible
it is to be able to build a

405
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,680
team is, I think, a really
good starting point.

406
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,590
And then I think when you have
those teams, making sure that

407
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,300
each person on your team can
fully understand how their

408
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,780
work impacts your vision, and
that your vision is crystal

409
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,250
clear and it's compelling &mdash;

410
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,090
those are some of the most
important things you need to

411
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,210
do on a constant,
constant basis.

412
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,850
I'm constantly reiterating our
vision and making sure that

413
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,670
every single person in the
room understands how they

414
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,750
directly impact that vision.

415
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,080
And we're at 250.

416
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,860
I don't know what's next, in
terms of how we scale.

417
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,460
Some of you may be able
to tell me that.

418
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,650
But I still know the first and
last name of every single

419
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,310
person on the team, and what
they do, and how that impacts

420
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,840
the vision.

421
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,680
So there's that ability to stay
connected to your team

422
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,613
that I think means all
the world to them.

423
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:14,044
MARY GROVE: Thank you.

424
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:14,910
Great.

425
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,740
Mary Lou, a product
question for you.

426
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,170
I am just fascinated by the
way you have been able to

427
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,560
dramatically disrupt the
display industry &mdash;

428
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,050
slashing power consumption,
slashing the cost.

429
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,310
Talk to us about the process
of bringing an idea into

430
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,810
product, specifically physical
product form.

431
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,570
And what lessons have you
learned in the various

432
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,340
iterations of display that
enable you do the work that

433
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,590
you do today?

434
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,480

435
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,180
MARY LOU JEPSEN: It's
interesting, because these

436
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,330
days, the manufacturing is
controlled by a small number

437
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,530
of countries, primarily Taiwan
and South Korea.

438
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:55,840
And so you need to figure out
how to deal with cultures,

439
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,650
learn the languages,
and so forth.

440
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,170
But in many ways, it's freed
me for the last decade,

441
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,100
because I don't really actually
have to worry about

442
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,200
manufacturing problems,
yield reliability.

443
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,830
Because basically, all I have to
do is get a whole bunch of

444
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,410
people to say yes because
they have my back.

445
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,590
And if I can get about 100
people in the various fabs to

446
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,190
say yes &mdash; they say no 99% of
the time, but you work and

447
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,030
noodle through.

448
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:26,840
And so the industry has changed
so much since when I

449
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,890
started, when we built our own
manufacturing facilities, till

450
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,115
now that the problem &mdash;

451
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:35,820

452
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,700
I've sat on a bunch of startup
panels over the past year, and

453
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,250
I've noticed a rise of the
multinational startup.

454
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,410
And it's hard &mdash;

455
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,260
15 time zones and languages &mdash;

456
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,640
but there's these huge
advantages in doing that if

457
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,370
you can navigate the
cultural things.

458
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,340
So the product stuff is sort of
more cultural, and how to

459
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,730
get people to come together in
various, if you will, axes of

460
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,630
creativity &mdash;

461
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,900
Asia's creative in that they
create a million units a day

462
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,990
of something.

463
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:08,230
And maybe they're not sort of,
in some Silicon Valley terms,

464
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,460
swinging for the fences in an
innovative architecture.

465
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,940
But boy, can you combine those
two axes and the sensibility

466
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,260
around these things, process
windows, and yields, and

467
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,250
[INAUDIBLE], all of that
has to work on

468
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,600
any product you make.

469
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,870
But a lot of the engineers there
have never been allowed

470
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,810
to get in the lab and break
things, and not do what I say,

471
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,500
like violate what I say.

472
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,610
And sort of creating &mdash;

473
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,960
it comes back to team and
creating these cultures where

474
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,170
you can create these hybrids.

475
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,090
And take these super-creative
people and get them good on

476
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,360
both axes, really.

477
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,040
It's never a single
individual.

478
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,100
It's creating the
team to do that.

479
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,440
MARY GROVE: Caterina, you have
built three successful

480
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,520
consumer technologies, had
two phenomenal exits.

481
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,090
Can you talk with us about the
process of exit and the

482
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,460
different factors and
consideration in your mind,

483
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,930
and how you navigated that?

484
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,870
CATERINA FAKE: Well, exits &mdash;

485
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,034
exits are &mdash;

486
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:11,010
exits &mdash;

487
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,460
there's always kind of a lot
of stories behind the exits

488
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,710
that are not visible
or understood.

489
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:25,740
So to kind of go back
to Flickr, which

490
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,940
was acquired by Yahoo!

491
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,710
In 2005, Flickr came out of
a company that had failed.

492
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,870
We had started a company
to build a game.

493
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,460
And we had started it in 2002,
which if you recall, was a

494
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,820
terrible time to raise
capital for anything.

495
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,780
Especially a consumer
internet play.

496
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:51,390
And we were also trying to do
something that people didn't

497
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,690
really understand.

498
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,010
We were building a browser-based
game.

499
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,770
It was a massively multiplayer
role playing game.

500
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,660
It was somewhat quirky.

501
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,620
It was a bit odd.

502
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,860
And it was not understood
what the hell it was.

503
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,880
People were like, can you buy
it on the shelf at CompUSA?

504
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,230
Like what is this thing?

505
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,020
And the only things that you
played in your browser at the

506
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:17,700
time were Solitaire
and casual games.

507
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,200
And so it would be kind of
like an exaggeration &mdash;

508
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,260
I mean, it would be an
understatement to say really

509
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,770
that we had trouble
raising money.

510
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,850
We were unable to
raise any money.

511
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,360
We prevailed upon our friends
and family, who finally gave

512
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,180
us, we managed to scrape
together $150,000, $200,000 to

513
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,390
actually run our company.

514
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,560
But nobody was getting paid.

515
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,610
And it really kind of struck
me when Julia was talking

516
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,400
about the team, that here
are all these people.

517
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,150
Not only were the Flickr team
members along for this crazy

518
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,800
ride, but most of us weren't
getting paid.

519
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,480
So it was a bit nuts.

520
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,340
And to get up every morning &mdash;
the only guy that was getting

521
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,600
paid was the guy who
had three kids.

522
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,080
So if you want to survive
in this industry.

523
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,670
It's actually been proven
to be the case.

524
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,420
Like in the Donner Party, only
the single men were eaten.

525
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,280
[LAUGHTER]

526
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,130
CATERINA FAKE: Get married
and have children

527
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,620
as fast as you can.

528
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,800
So anyway, the only guy who was
getting paid was the guy

529
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,930
who had three children.

530
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,310
Survival, people.

531
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,650
This is what it's about.

532
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,800
Like the startup businesses
is like, do or die.

533
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,450
It's like a revolution.

534
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,950
You're like, you win
or you're dead.

535
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,730
[LAUGHTER]

536
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,530
And this was kind
of like that.

537
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,140
So we were dying.

538
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,490
We had about three months of
money left in the bank.

539
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,330
We were eating ramen
and selling our

540
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,700
furniture to make payroll.

541
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,220
And then we said, to
hell with this.

542
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,450
This is going to fail.

543
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,200
This game is doomed.

544
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,720
And we gotta do something
else.

545
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,810
We only have three months of
money left to pay our one guy.

546
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:03,820
So Stewart has this idea.

547
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,290
He's like, photo-sharing.

548
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,530
He wakes up in the middle
of the night.

549
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,140
He's like literally got
103-degree fever.

550
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,720
I was married to him at the
time, so this is why we're

551
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,490
waking up together, with
my co-founder.

552
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,200
And he's like, we should do
a photo-sharing site.

553
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,160
And I'm like, you're &mdash;

554
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,870
whatever.

555
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,350
Drink some water.

556
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,290
Go back to bed.

557
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,450
And so we talked about it a
little bit more, and we

558
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,050
figured, OK, well, there's a lot
of things that we learned

559
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,010
from the social aspects
of our game.

560
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,960
We can put this together.

561
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,320
We can make a thing.

562
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,680
We spent about eight weeks
developing this thing.

563
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,770
We called it Flickr.

564
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,520
It was a chat where you could
drag and drop photos into a

565
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,920
conversation.

566
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:51,000
It was actually a POS, but it
was widely noticed, actually.

567
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,050
Because if you recall back at
the time &mdash; it was like 2003 &mdash;

568
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,890
social networking was on the
rise, and people thought this

569
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,300
was cool and this
was like social

570
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,320
networking around photos.

571
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,170
And so we kind of had hit
it, and we kind of

572
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:04,910
knew we'd hit it.

573
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,410
Because suddenly we were getting
calls and people were

574
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,880
interested in us, and we were
six unknown people in

575
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,410
Vancouver, and nobody
would return &mdash; so it

576
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,380
was kind of a thing.

577
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,244
Anyway, we were talking
about exits.

578
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:15,400
[LAUGHTER]

579
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,190
MARY GROVE: So many great
insights I just

580
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,180
took away from there.

581
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,520
Have children.

582
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,500
Great ideas come from a fever.

583
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,080
CATERINA FAKE: So this was the
pivot, and then it was

584
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,860
successful.

585
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,155
And then we got a call from
bunch of acquirers.

586
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:26,375
And then we were acquired.

587
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,130
MARY GROVE: Thank you.

588
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,750
[LAUGHTER]

589
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,800
CATERINA FAKE: Just
to wrap up.

590
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,664
[LAUGHTER]

591
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:34,858
[APPLAUSE]

592
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:36,040
MARY GROVE: So amazing.

593
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,070
CATERINA FAKE: Sorry.

594
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,700
MARY GROVE: In just a couple
minutes, we'll start taking

595
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,740
questions from the audience.

596
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,480
So I encourage you, if you
have a question in mind,

597
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,250
please go ahead and start
lining up at the two

598
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,440
microphones here.

599
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,540
So next question is for Slava,
and it's more of a

600
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,150
policy-related question.

601
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,630
I'm really intrigued by your
work with the JOBS Act and

602
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,260
representing the crowdfunding
community.

603
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,420
So please talk with us about
the role that founders and

604
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,140
entrepreneurs can play in
advancing the conversation

605
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,360
forward around tech policy.

606
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,820
SLAVA RUBIN: Yeah, so I'll take
a little bit of a windy

607
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,480
road there.

608
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,575
It was interesting, when they
asked about, how many of you

609
00:27:08,575 --> 00:27:11,260
are entrepreneurs, how many
of you raised your hands.

610
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,390
I don't know if you would change
your question if the

611
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,830
question was, how many of
you are entrepreneurial?

612
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,430
I actually think probably more
of you are entrepreneurs than

613
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,120
raised your hands.

614
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,070
See, in our perspective of it,
yes entrepreneur might mean to

615
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,610
actually have started the
business or whatever.

616
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,380
But we recruit mostly
entrepreneurs.

617
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,220
It's actually quite challenging,
in terms of when

618
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,740
you want to be collaborative
and authentic and all that.

619
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,680
But see, there's certain types
of people who say, oh, I

620
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,180
didn't get to do that
because there wasn't

621
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,810
enough this, right?

622
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,260
I didn't have enough
money, enough time.

623
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,410
That person didn't let me.

624
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,060
We couldn't partner
with that company.

625
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,760
And there's certain types of
people that say, I got to

626
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,480
figure it out this way.

627
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,870
And the people who don't take
no for an answer and don't

628
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,890
really care what the obstacle
is in front of them are

629
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,820
entrepreneurs.

630
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,370
That's the spirit of the
entrepreneur, which is, "See

631
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,750
wall, run through it." But
actually fail five times, so

632
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,050
get your head hurt
really hard.

633
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:05,760
Right?

634
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,070
That's entrepreneur.

635
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,840
And in my opinion &mdash;

636
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,530
you're getting into a pet
project, which is

637
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,780
entrepreneurs can
save the world.

638
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,890
Which is entrepreneurs
will figure out the

639
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,210
solution to any problem.

640
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,380
And it's really just a language
that hasn't been

641
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,210
fostered enough.

642
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,800
Which is, it's obvious that
we should learn math, OK?

643
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,360
It became obvious that
we should learn

644
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,030
languages beyond English.

645
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,920
Cool.

646
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,710
Now it's become obvious
that we should

647
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,570
all learn code, right?

648
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,510
So you have code.org.

649
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,170
You have Chicago starting to
teach code into every high

650
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,260
school, all this good stuff.

651
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,840
It's just a matter of time
before it becomes obvious that

652
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,550
teaching, in an experiential
way, entrepreneurship should

653
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,200
be part of your curriculum
from seventh grade, third

654
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,700
grade, or whatever grade.

655
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,790
And I've written stuff
about this.

656
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,390
Which is kind of sad, in my
opinion, that when you're a

657
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,450
little kid in kindergarten, and
you have those little toys

658
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,750
that you play with, you get to
play with fireman or woman.

659
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,940
You get to play with nurse.

660
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,970
You get to play with
lawyer, doctor.

661
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,285
You don't get to play
with entrepreneur.

662
00:29:09,285 --> 00:29:10,330
[LAUGHTER]

663
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,830
SLAVA RUBIN: And it might be
because it's really hard to

664
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,590
say entrepreneur.

665
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,550
So we could just call
it Google, whatever.

666
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,960
[LAUGHTER]

667
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,060
SLAVA RUBIN: But really, that's
a statement as to how

668
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,800
we grow up.

669
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,760
And it's funny, because when
we graduate high school or

670
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,360
college, we're all told to be
innovative and leaders and all

671
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,820
this stuff.

672
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,200
But really, what we're prepared
to do is to become

673
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,780
bankers or developers or
consultants or whatever you

674
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,460
want to call it inside somebody
else's organization,

675
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,090
which is inside of a system that
somebody else created.

676
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,450
Why isn't it that we are being
taught to be able to take

677
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,260
risk, be creative, fail &mdash;

678
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,170
it's totally good to fail.

679
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,060
We just have to learn that.

680
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,340
Learn from it.

681
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,920
So for me, the idea of whether
it's equity crowdfunding,

682
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,190
which is where Indiegogo has
had a lot of participation

683
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,530
with the SEC and the White
House and all that stuff.

684
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,400
But also in terms of
empowering more

685
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,940
entrepreneurs &mdash; if you get off
on the sixth floor of our

686
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,270
office, which is at 965 Mission,
which is right on the

687
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:07,210
corner, the first word you'll
see is a huge sign of the word

688
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,290
"Empower."

689
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,830
I mean, that is Indiegogo.

690
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,050
Which is to empower people
to do what they

691
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,320
didn't think is possible.

692
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,800
See, if you empower an
entrepreneur to do something,

693
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,010
you could change the trajectory
of the future.

694
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,010
There could have an air there
yesterday, and an entrepreneur

695
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,040
will create reality.

696
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,140
So it's just fascinating.

697
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,786
So I think more of you should
have raised your hands.

698
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:27,235
MARY GROVE: Great, great.

699
00:30:27,235 --> 00:30:32,070
[APPLAUSE]

700
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,140
MARY GROVE: We're going to do
some rapid-fire questions, so

701
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,310
we'll try to do one minute each
question, if possible.

702
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,062
Please.

703
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:42,770
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Kent Nixon,
and I guess this is a question

704
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,000
for all of you, but specifically
for Mary Lou.

705
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,400
Because I'm a computer
engineer, and

706
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,920
my passion is hardware.

707
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,190
And I agree with what you're
saying, a lot of the stuff out

708
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,420
there nowadays is software
as opposed to hardware.

709
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,640
But when I look at a piece of
hardware, I can say, wow,

710
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,450
that's really great, but.

711
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,870
And there's always that but.

712
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,560
And I think I can make it
better, but I have a specific

713
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,080
set of skills, and it takes more
than just me to make a

714
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,230
great product.

715
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,780
I mean, how do you go about
finding people that meet the

716
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,480
skill sets that you
don't have?

717
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,890
How do you go about even making
the contacts to learn

718
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,930
about that kind of stuff?

719
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:21,390
Like where would you even
start, basically?

720
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,010
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Yeah,
interesting.

721
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,120
Because there's not
a lot of hardware.

722
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,100
You know, IEEE has a ton of
meetings every week, here in

723
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,060
the Bay Area, if you're
in the Bay Area.

724
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:35,190
But actually, OLPC, One Laptop
Per Child, $100 laptop?

725
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,920
It was a really small
hardware team.

726
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,785
It was just me for the first 18
months, and then we grew to

727
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:44,510
the massive size of, I think,
four hardware engineers that

728
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,310
were actually at OLPC.

729
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:51,310
And used kind of Asia, Inc. and
the people that I was able

730
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,700
to create a team around, we
were sort of dotted-line

731
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,890
architects for groups of
low-level engineers in Asia.

732
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,455
It means living on a plane.

733
00:31:59,455 --> 00:32:01,985

734
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:04,300
If you love it enough, you're
willing to do that.

735
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,050
It means learning the various
languages and so forth.

736
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,740
But it depends the scale of
what you're trying to do.

737
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,400
And if you're saying, yes,
I like that, but &mdash;

738
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,840
you could join that team
or take it apart.

739
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,170
It's hard, because you can hack
different things, but it

740
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,250
tends to be a big thing
hanging &mdash; you know, a

741
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,940
functional tethered prototype.

742
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,500
And it's really hard
for a VC to get &mdash;

743
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,300
VCs, actually, they don't have
the core competence anymore in

744
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,650
Silicon Valley, pretty
much, to &mdash;

745
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,210
and I'm sure there's
exceptions.

746
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,580
But by and large, to
fund or even to do

747
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,620
diligence on hardware.

748
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,930
But there are places that do
fund hardware, and you can

749
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,890
find them, depending
upon your bent.

750
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,450
You do have to be creative.

751
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,940
There are angels, certainly, and
super angels to fund it.

752
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,260
And there are the hackerspaces
if you need to borrow an

753
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,970
oscilloscope for whatever,
and SEM.

754
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,670
But yeah, it's not easy.

755
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:05,090
But then again, there's not
this sort of path &mdash;

756
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,870
there's not much competition.

757
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,120
So there's an advantage.

758
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,427

759
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:13,680
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so this is
[INAUDIBLE] from China.

760
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,880
So actually, I have a question,
but not specific to

761
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,130
any of you guys.

762
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,300
And so my question is, because
we can find a lot of common

763
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,640
factor for successful
founders.

764
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,280
And so I want to know, what is
your rating for the below

765
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,490
three factors?

766
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,640
They are vision, idea,
and execution.

767
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,390
So how can you rate these three
factors, and what's the

768
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,640
reason for that?

769
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,709

770
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:41,230
MARY GROVE: Julia?

771
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,550
JULIA HARTZ: I'm trying to
understand the question.

772
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,870
MARY GROVE: So vision &mdash;

773
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,380
JULIA HARTZ: Like how would
I rate mission?

774
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,350
AUDIENCE: Vision, idea,
and execution.

775
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,150
JULIA HARTZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

776
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,170
I would rate &mdash;

777
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,410
if I had a stack rank them?

778
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,600
AUDIENCE: From like 0
to 10, or 1 to 10?

779
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,940
[LAUGHTER]

780
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,260
JULIA HARTZ: I'm shooting
in the dark, here.

781
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,199
I'll try to understand
the question.

782
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,480
I think that vision is really
important when you're trying

783
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,330
to lead a group of people.

784
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,060
I think execution is how you get
from point A to point B,

785
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,610
as Caterina can attest
to, as can we.

786
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,090
And how you eventually
get people to

787
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,980
believe in your idea.

788
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,730
But you don't really
start doing

789
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,800
anything without the idea.

790
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,510
So I think they're all
intrinsically linked, and so

791
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,360
I'm not sure if I
would rank them.

792
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,106
But I think that as
an entrepreneur &mdash;

793
00:34:32,106 --> 00:34:34,650

794
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:38,310
I don't necessarily think you
have be the person who can

795
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,350
sell the vision.

796
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,980
I think you have to do what
Slava said, which is, be

797
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,630
willing to run through as
many walls as possible.

798
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:50,719
I, too, agree with him, in terms
of that's what makes an

799
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,830
entrepreneur an entrepreneur, is
just that eternal optimism.

800
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:58,110
But I think that having that
idea and having that moment

801
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,810
that Stewart had, when he woke
up in the middle the night, is

802
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,610
exactly what goes into
this mixture.

803
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,440
And then vision is something
that really matters when

804
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,896
you're trying to get people
to sign on to your idea.

805
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:12,830
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because
nowadays, also, we just feel

806
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,090
like ideas, we have a
lot of same ideas.

807
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,805
But no one just go ahead
and execute them.

808
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:22,670
So probably execution is one of
the most important when you

809
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,330
have the idea.

810
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,650
JULIA HARTZ: Well, I mean,
that's how you make the idea

811
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,650
into a reality.

812
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,990
You have to execute.

813
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:32,060
And honestly, like day to day,
we're put to the task of

814
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:38,370
executing, even seven years
into our vision, I guess.

815
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,640
If you're not executing, then
you really aren't able to grow

816
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,960
a viable idea into a company and
get people to support you.

817
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,180
So yeah, I think they're all
incredibly important.

818
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,760
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

819
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,750
SLAVA RUBIN: I would say that
"idea is super important" is

820
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,250
one of the ten myths of
entrepreneurship.

821
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,580
Meaning, it's not.

822
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,030
If it was so big of an idea, if
it mattered so much, then

823
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:06,520
the idea of a coffee shop would
not become Starbucks.

824
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,760
Obviously, other people know
that idea as well.

825
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,970
So it's really about
execution.

826
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,630
AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

827
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:10,940
Thank you.

828
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,800
MARY GROVE: Thank you.

829
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,836
We have time for one
more question.

830
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:17,030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] touched on
this a little bit, but I'm

831
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,320
hoping someone else will
volunteer to chime in.

832
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,750
And my question is, how did
you find your co-founder?

833
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,240
And how did you know they
were the right person?

834
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,890
Or did you?

835
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,218
SLAVA RUBIN: Match.com, right?

836
00:36:28,218 --> 00:36:31,676
[LAUGHTER]

837
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:32,664
MARY GROVE: A wedding.

838
00:36:32,664 --> 00:36:34,146
JULIA HARTZ: I met
him at a wedding.

839
00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:40,440
[LAUGHTER]

840
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,740
SLAVA RUBIN: So my co-founders
were &mdash;

841
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,540
there's two co-founders.

842
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,640
One was the technical guy.

843
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,350
So he and I worked at
the same consulting

844
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,070
firm for eight years.

845
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,280
We're best friends.

846
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,380
We used to live together.

847
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,970
He was on the tech side.

848
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,795
So he had to round out his skill
set, he thought, so to

849
00:36:55,795 --> 00:36:57,000
go get his MBA.

850
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,140
So he went to Haas to get his
MBA while I kept on working.

851
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,280
And like anybody who keeps on
working who has a friend

852
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,270
that's getting their MBA, you go
visit them for the weekend

853
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,810
to get drunk for the weekend.

854
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:09,120
And anybody who goes to get
their MBA, they have to start

855
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,580
a business, so they have to
start coming up with ideas.

856
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,370
So he met his co-founder,
which is Danae, his

857
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,210
friend at the time.

858
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,500
Danae and I flew out for dinner,
and we were all just

859
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,350
talking about stuff.

860
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,096
And the idea was born.

861
00:37:23,096 --> 00:37:25,760
MARY GROVE: So I'd like to ask
each of our panelists to share

862
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,810
with our entrepreneurial
audience just one piece of

863
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,180
parting advice.

864
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,980
In no particular order.

865
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,730
CATERINA FAKE: Well, I think the
main thing, as Slava was

866
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,990
saying earlier, is it's
very easy to do

867
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,850
startups these days.

868
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,625
So just really start.

869
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,970
Start from where you are
with what you have.

870
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,580
If you don't have a co-founder,
start without a

871
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,100
co-founder.

872
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,630
I think a lot of time &mdash;

873
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,010
it's interesting.

874
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,830
A get a lot of emails from
entrepreneurs, asking, I need

875
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,350
a co-founder.

876
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,150
I can't find a co-founder.

877
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,000
How do I found a co-founder.

878
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,320
That is actually a huge issue.

879
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,430
Go to more weddings,
is one possibility.

880
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,900
I mean, actually, you
know, whatever.

881
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,400
Luck favors the aggressive.

882
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,340
So you should go meet as
many people as you can.

883
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,570
It's easier if you're
an extrovert.

884
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,910
If you're an introvert,
just go to

885
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:16,150
everything and talk to everybody.

886
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,600
And find that co-founder
out there.

887
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,060
But really, just start
making the thing

888
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,980
that you want to make.

889
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,530
If you can only do it with
a piece of paper and

890
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,050
a pencil, do that.

891
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,260
It'll come together.

892
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,020
In fact, I'm an investor
in Kickstarter.

893
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,030
It's a competitor of Slava's.

894
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,990
And I actually saw it when it
was just a Photoshop file.

895
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,270
It was actually just &mdash; it was
an image in Photoshop.

896
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,840
I was like, I see this.

897
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,972
SLAVA RUBIN: Yeah,
I think that &mdash;

898
00:38:44,972 --> 00:38:48,850
you know how sometimes people
tell you, oh, that's hot.

899
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,020
Don't touch it.

900
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,250
Yet you still kind of
need to touch it?

901
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,250
And you figure out that it was
hot, hotter than you thought?

902
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,230
That your tolerance for heat
was not higher than their

903
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,020
tolerance for heat?

904
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,660
[LAUGHTER]

905
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,070
It's interesting that you know
what I'm talking about, right?

906
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,790
Because most of you have
probably done that.

907
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,000
But see, here is the same thing
at a different level.

908
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,770
There's a macrosocial contract
of what it means to be able to

909
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,860
break through something or
not as an entrepreneur.

910
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,020
So we fall within these rules
of, your idea is not big

911
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,810
enough, because a VC told you.

912
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,940
There's things like &mdash;

913
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,230
it's, I don't know
marketing enough.

914
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,320
I don't know PR enough.

915
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:26,660
Right?

916
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,790
There's all these different
macrosocial contract concepts,

917
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,260
which is the same thing as if
somebody told you it's hot.

918
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,630
Yet you were all daring
enough to touch

919
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,200
the kettle, the whatever.

920
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,290
You should just experience it
yourself, and then learn for

921
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,530
yourself your own truths.

922
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,490
Because I dare you &mdash; you
will that most of

923
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,520
those are just fiction.

924
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,950
They're somebody else's truths
that they could not break

925
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,070
through that.

926
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,260
Right?

927
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,680
So there's no reason that you
would not be able to.

928
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,360

929
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,410
[APPLAUSE]

930
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,770
MARY LOU JEPSEN: My advice is,
assuming that you start big

931
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,440
and swing for the fences, and
just don't do &mdash; don't do

932
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,030
something small, first off.

933
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,840
But assuming you do, and you get
to that point where you're

934
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,240
taking on one of the largest
companies in the world, even

935
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,830
though you didn't mean to &mdash;

936
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,970
I've never started to mean to.

937
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,780
Be prepared to give away most
of your stock so you

938
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,600
can win that game.

939
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,120
Because otherwise,
you're crushed.

940
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,550
And just plan that early
on, what you're going

941
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,570
to do if you happen &mdash;

942
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,710
at One Laptop Per Child, I think
there was a "60 Minutes"

943
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,330
expose on some of
the large forces

944
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,620
that we came up against.

945
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,400
And a lot of the stories
I haven't yet

946
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,610
told about Pixel Qi.

947
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,180
But when you do get in that
seat, you have to be able to

948
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:54,890
figure out a way where it's
more attractive for those

949
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,870
companies not to crush you.

950
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,760
And that's very difficult.

951
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,030
And if you can plan for success
at the start, maybe

952
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,970
you can sort of navigate
through.

953
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,020
That's, I think, the most
difficult challenges I've

954
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,050
faced in my career.

955
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,870
And the other thing is,
why do startups?

956
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,060
If you just join a big
company, I mean &mdash;

957
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,820
I'm really bad at politics.

958
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,320
I think if you do your own
thing, you can actually,

959
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,820
you're all in a little
lifeboat.

960
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,950
There might be leaks in it.

961
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,820
But you get to be out on the
sea yourself and figure out

962
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,890
your own way and learn all
the different things.

963
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,520
And then maybe you can start to
sort of leverage the sharp

964
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,120
elbows in larger companies.

965
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,410
Some people are better at it,
but if you're not one for the

966
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,730
politics of large companies,
startups are great.

967
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,050
Because everybody's in the same
boat, willing to help

968
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:38,460
each other.

969
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,945
They're really fantastic
environments.

970
00:41:39,945 --> 00:41:42,230
So go for it.

971
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,400
JULIA HARTZ: The biggest lesson
that I've learned along

972
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,580
this journey &mdash; and it was a
pretty big one for me, coming

973
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,030
from traditional media &mdash; is
don't believe the hype.

974
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,520
And I think I touch on that
almost weekly when I think

975
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,330
about what's important to us.

976
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,940
And hype is a fairly vague term
as I'm using it, which is

977
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,230
either bad hype, the way Slava
was just presenting, that you

978
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:03,840
can't do something.

979
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,680
You don't have enough
experience, or there isn't

980
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,720
money in X, or this idea's
too played out.

981
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,600
And it's also on the flip side,
that god, things are

982
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:11,970
going great.

983
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,380
I'm great.

984
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,280
I must be great.

985
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,000
This is great.

986
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,180
There's one thing about having
confidence in yourself.

987
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,670
There's the other thing in
always looking at the next

988
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,200
thing you need to be doing to
making your product better,

989
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,980
making your team batter, to
making your brand better.

990
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,136
And it's not about &mdash;

991
00:42:29,136 --> 00:42:32,840
if all you care about is the
hype and all you're seeking is

992
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,710
the hype, there's very
little context.

993
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,330
Or there's nothing really
underneath that.

994
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,440
And that's where I tend
to see things go awry.

995
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,380
So try not to believe
the hype, whether

996
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,380
it be good or bad.

997
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,280
MARY GROVE: Great.

998
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,510
Well, three words that we've
heard consistently throughout

999
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,360
our discussion are
democratization, passion, and

1000
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,470
change the world.

1001
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,030
And we truly believe that
entrepreneurs have

1002
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,120
transformative ability to change
their communities,

1003
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,100
their companies, the world.

1004
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,860
And that when entrepreneurs
succeed, all boats rise.

1005
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,230
So, really appreciate all
four of your time.

1006
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,960
Wish you the best of luck, and
wish all of you in the

1007
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,460
audience the best
of luck, too.

1008
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,360
Thank you.

1009
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:14,365
[APPLAUSE]
