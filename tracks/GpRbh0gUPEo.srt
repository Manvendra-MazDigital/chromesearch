00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,550

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,560
Hello, and welcome to
GDL-IL, GDL Israel.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,050
Today we're going to speak
about Compute Engine.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,390
And I'll try to show you how
easy it is to start a new

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,990
instance of your own virtual
machine on Google

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,270
infrastructure.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,550
And since in most of the cases,
we're talking here in

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,350
Google Developer Live Israel
about entrepreneurship,

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,820
start-ups, and front
end development.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,210
I'll try to show you how you
could quickly create a micro

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,800
instance, install Apache on it
and from there you could take

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,920
it and do some clever,
amazing things.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,610
Of course, you could take these
same exact steps and

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,420
install any other piece of
software that you would like

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,460
to install on a new
virtual Linux box.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,580
It could be node.js.

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,190
It could be [? nyc.js. ?]

18
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,980
It could be lots of
other things.

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,165
So let's jump and see.

20
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:08,210
I'll show my screen.

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,770
And as you can see here, if you
go to cloud.google.com,

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,800
you'll have quite a lot of
different products that today

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,730
we are supporting.

24
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,020
Right now, in this episode,
so we're going to focus on

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,420
Compute Engine.

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,880
However, if you want platform
as a service, and you are

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,640
developing your service site in
Java, iPhone, [? GO, ?] or

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,110
PHP, App Engine might be an even
more suitable solution.

29
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,170
Definitely if you're doing
something nice in terms of

30
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,050
your ATI, so Cloud Endpoint
could be a

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,280
great product for that.

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,000
Or you just want to build some
web service and support it

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,520
from App Engine.

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,300
With App Engine, you're
basically running in a certain

35
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,720
container that Google is
maintaining, scaling, and

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,520
taking care of all the quote,
unquote, "redundant" jobs that

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,759
you don't want to do as your
own system administrator.

38
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,960
You want to focus on what you're
good at, and write your

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,780
amazing software.

40
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,320
Other things that we have &mdash;
we'll try to touch them in the

41
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,430
next few weeks &mdash; will be cloud
storage and Cloud SQL.

42
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,360
And, of course, BigQuery, the
ability to run clever queries

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,960
on billions of rows and
get the results in

44
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,880
less than a few seconds.

45
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,090
So as we said, Compute Engine
basically lets you run Linux

46
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,260
virtual machines, and talking
to them, and do whatever you

47
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,070
want with those machines.

48
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,240
Let's see how I could do it.

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,600
If you'll go to Google Cloud
Console like I have here,

50
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,580
probably you won't have
too many projects

51
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,210
like I do here but.

52
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,980
But in this case, you're
just clicking

53
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,360
on Create New Project.

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,340
And I did it already just to
save time, and you'll get all

55
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,510
the different options of what
you want to do in this

56
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,020
specific project.

57
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,210
Now in our case, we choose
the Compute Engine.

58
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,560
And, of course, we need
to enable billing.

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,690
In App Engine, you have the
ability to run up to 12

60
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,800
projects without any billing.

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,860
So if you want just to test
things inside App Engine, just

62
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,440
choose this far now.

63
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,230
If you want to try Compute
Engine, you will need to

64
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,870
enable billing.

65
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,180
Lucky for us and to save time,
I already prepared a project

66
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,110
with billing enabled.

67
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,520
And if we'll go into it, you
could see here that you have

68
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,060
several things that
you could do with.

69
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,290
One, I already created a box.

70
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,500
And I created a micro version
of it because we don't need

71
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,670
too much if you want just
to run one, let's say,

72
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,380
development server, and testings
up in the cloud.

73
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,710
If you click on this line,
you'll get quite a lot of

74
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,450
different things that
are attaching to

75
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,130
this specific box.

76
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,580
And, for us, maybe what's
important here is the zone.

77
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,330
So it could be in the United
States or in Europe and, in

78
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,250
our case, in Israel,
I choose Europe.

79
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,620
The external IP so we could
reach this machine, and of

80
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,450
course, some other parameters,
like the disk and the network.

81
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,200
Down here at the bottom, you
have the ability to see how

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,730
you want to communicate
with the specific box.

83
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,470
In our case, we choose SSH, and
to work with SSH, we have

84
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,780
this nice GC SQL tool, that
after you install it &mdash;

85
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,120
and it's quite easy.

86
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Four steps, four clicks and
you're installing it &mdash;

87
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,660
you run this specific
command in order to

88
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,080
connect to your box.

89
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,460
Now as I said, I already
attached to this box.

90
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,770
Now let's see just
that I share the

91
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,710
right screen with you.

92
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,700
Let's cancel this screen share,
and I'll try to share

93
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:07,360
my desktop so you'll be able to
see everything that I do.

94
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,305
Let's close this one, and here
we already connected basically

95
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:15,870
to our box.

96
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,680
And as you can see here, I first
just want to show all

97
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,600
the different packages
that I have.

98
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,920
I have 230, so it's
not too much.

99
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,150
All the essential packages that
you will want to see when

100
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,460
you start to do things.

101
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,250
And here you could get, of
course, a more thorough look

102
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,710
of all the different packages
that you have.

103
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,805
And as you can see up here, what
I previously did already

104
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:50,580
is, I just run this one command
of Sudo, App Get,

105
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,280
Install Apache 2.

106
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,490
And now in our case, of course,
it's already there so

107
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,070
it's letting me know
that it's there.

108
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,260
But if it wasn't, was just
downloading and installing it

109
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,870
for me, now that I have it, I
could go, of course, to this

110
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,250
location of var.dub.dub.dub.

111
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,290
And here I just want to
see what files I have.

112
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,320
I have, of course, a different
index HTML file that Apache is

113
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,460
bringing to me.

114
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,840
And to make things a bit
nicer, I also put

115
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,560
that To Do List app.

116
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,900
Of course, they have all of
the MV-Star frameworks.

117
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,800
And with a little twist of using
a leverage IndexDB so

118
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,810
everything will be the same
for us locally as well.

119
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:41,360
And if I'm going to now to,
let's take here, my instance.

120
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,900
And in the instance I could
see the external IP.

121
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,280
Right now I don't have any
DNS settings for it.

122
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,590
I'll just go here, put it.

123
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,000
And, of course, we're getting
the first Hello World of

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,230
Apache, but if I'll just go
here and try to go to the

125
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,040
special demo that I prepared.

126
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,540
So you can see here that
we have all the nice

127
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:17,500
capabilities here.

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,780
And, of course, if I'm
refreshing everything, it's

129
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,250
still working and I could delete
stuff, and it's a quite

130
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,660
nice application.

131
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,750
If I want to change it or to
change anything, let's see how

132
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,140
this works.

133
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:36,350
Of course, I'm just coming here,
and entering the file.

134
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,103
Hello all.

135
00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:44,150
Should be L, I, L. Yours.

136
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,570
Thank you for watching.

137
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,360

138
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,760
After I saved it, and
I'm refreshing &mdash;

139
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,770
you could see here that I'm
having a full control.

140
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,650
One thing that you want to
remember is that when you go

141
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,700
in here, you have the ability
and you should go to network

142
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,350
and basically make sure, if
you want to have certain

143
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,640
settings to your own network,
you have full control of it,

144
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,180
if you want to take a snapshot
and save the data and the

145
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,630
state this specific instance,
you could create a new

146
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,240
snapshot, and it would basically
allow you to save

147
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,490
all the data that you
right now have in

148
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,450
this specific machine.

149
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,560
And then replicate it and create
new machines out of

150
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,980
this instance.

151
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:38,150
Another nice thing to note is,
when you're coming to this

152
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,150
console and on network, you
could go to the default.

153
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,240
And here you have fewer
firewalls that you

154
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,030
might want to set.

155
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,710
Of course, internal IPs
we are allowing.

156
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,580
And then if you need the SSH
like we did here, of course,

157
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,210
it's open by default.

158
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,700
And then what you want to do in
this case is just to enable

159
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,360
the web server firewall.

160
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,820
Because if you want to allow it
to access on TCP and heed

161
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,360
the server, you won't be able
to reach these pages.

162
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:17,130
Let's just for fun try to
delete this firewall.

163
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,030
And as you can see here,
it's now deleting it.

164
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:30,600
And if I'm refreshing and I want
to check it again, I see

165
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,470
now that I don't have it here.

166
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,640
And now if I try to reach our
Hello World page, you could

167
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,220
see that I can't do that.

168
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,000
So very important to remember
to basically create a new

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,010
instance and to give it &mdash; if
you'll try to put [INAUDIBLE],

170
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,440
it will let you know
that we're only

171
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,770
getting things like this.

172
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,240
So in our case, I'll do TCP.

173
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,380
And, of course, the name
will be Web Server.

174
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,900
And I'll create it.

175
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,790
You could see how quickly,
basically, it's creating

176
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,450
everything for you.

177
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,990
And once this is done, I'm
coming again here and hitting

178
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,510
it, and everything is
back to normal.

179
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:18,180
So I think we pretty much
covered the main things.

180
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,430
As you saw, it's quite easy to
establish a new instance, run

181
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,490
with it, have new packages
and models that will

182
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,060
make you more efficient.

183
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,270
And from that on, you have all
the nice abilities of taking

184
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:39,780
snapshots, controlling images,
and having all the metadata

185
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,060
and operations of what you do.

186
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,190
You could choose quite a lot
of different images.

187
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,780
I chose Debian but there's lots
of [INAUDIBLE] as well.

188
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:54,100
And two other things that you
might want to check are, as I

189
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,990
mentioned, you're hitting
cloud.google.com, but you have

190
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,010
two other locations if you
could work and check what

191
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:01,790
you're doing.

192
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,820
One will be called [INAUDIBLE]
google.com APIs.

193
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,570
And here you could basically see
what you're doing on each

194
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,690
and every project and what
APIs you're using or

195
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,375
allowing for it.

196
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,080
The other location is the App
Engine dashboard, so it would

197
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,330
be on AppEngine.google.com.

198
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,280
And here you could see all your
projects and, of course,

199
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,550
in our case, see exactly
what's going on

200
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,400
on the server itself.

201
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,680
So I think we covered most of
the things that we wanted, and

202
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,950
I think next time.

203
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,200
Thank you very much.

204
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:48,138
