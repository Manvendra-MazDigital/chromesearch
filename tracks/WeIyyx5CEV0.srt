00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:09,500

2
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,030
PETE LEPAGE: Hey everybody, and
welcome to another edition

3
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,020
of Chrome Apps Office Hours.

4
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,640
We've got a special Chrome Apps
Office Hours-- that's a

5
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,780
mouthful to say, always--

6
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,920
today, where we've brought in
two special guests, the

7
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,310
developers behind
the Reditr app.

8
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,190
So guys, let me bring you
up and say welcome.

9
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,586
Thanks for joining us.

10
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:36,480
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Thanks for
introducing us, there.

11
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,490
And, yeah, as you said,
we developed

12
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,940
an app called Reditr.

13
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,730
It's a really cool app, we
think, and it lets you

14
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,380
basically browse Reddit on
your desktop in a neat

15
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,970
column-based design, as
you can see here.

16
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,250
So Dimitry, do you want
to explain maybe a

17
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,340
bit about the app?

18
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,520
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well,
basically what's nice about

19
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,840
the columns is that it serves
as a feed of all the data--

20
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,390
like any custom feed that
you want from Reddit.

21
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,230
So you could have like a custom
search feed, multiple

22
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,890
subreddit feed, and if you have
it sorted by new, it'll

23
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,720
pull in new posts over
an interval.

24
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,920
And it'll be a live experience
of Reddit.

25
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,880
PETE LEPAGE: Very cool.

26
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,680
And so this is something that
you guys have been working on

27
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,410
for quite a while,
haven't you?

28
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,290
Or how long have you guys
been working on this?

29
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,200
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV:
Since October--

30
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,010
well, we released October
of last year, so yeah.

31
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,220
We've been working a little
bit over a year now.

32
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,320
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

33
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,850
So this is something that
you guys have built.

34
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,720
Did it start off as a
Chrome packaged app?

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,270
Or where did you
start with it?

36
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,176
Where were you doing it
in the very beginning?

37
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:50,860
DAVID ZORYCHTA: It's kind of a
funny story, actually, because

38
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,350
Dimitry and I came home from
school one day, and Dimitry

39
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,970
said, I'm bored.

40
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,290
I want to make a really
cool Reddit client.

41
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,920
Then I said, oh, cool,
good luck with that.

42
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,710
And then Dimitry started
looking into

43
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,466
developing in Qt--

44
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:04,020
C++ using the Qt framework.

45
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,900
And I frowned at Dimitry and
said, well, why do it in Qt

46
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,840
when you have this beautiful
HTML5 to design this rich

47
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,010
experience in?

48
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,365
So probably for the next month
after we decided we'd do it in

49
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:18,450
HTML5, we were looking for like
a way to publish our app.

50
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,470
I said, you know, we don't want
to make a boring website.

51
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,360
We want to make a full
desktop app.

52
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,810
So we were looking at maybe
XULRunner with Firefox, and

53
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,020
Appcelerator had a really
cool way to publish

54
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,830
desktop apps in HTML5.

55
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,740
But we stumbled upon the Chrome
App Store, and we

56
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,740
really fell in love with that
just because of the rich API

57
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,417
they give us, and it's just so
easy to make an app using the

58
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:41,700
Chrome API.

59
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,920
PETE LEPAGE: So that was about a
year or so ago, and that was

60
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,710
with the sort of v1 Chrome
packaged apps

61
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,020
that you did this.

62
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,675
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Yeah.

63
00:04:49,675 --> 00:04:52,560
PETE LEPAGE: So what did you
like about the Chrome Packaged

64
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,210
App platform at the time that
sort of said, OK, yeah this is

65
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,640
definitely where we want
to go with this?

66
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,065
What were some of
the key things?

67
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:02,880

68
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,110
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well, first
of all, it just felt

69
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,395
really easy to distribute
through the Chrome Web Store,

70
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:13,390
plus it was kind of new.

71
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,435
It was nice to be like one of
the early, I guess-- maybe a

72
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:18,810
year isn't too early,
but still.

73
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,480

74
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,730
DAVID ZORYCHTA: We're just two
guys, and we don't have any

75
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,440
marketing experience at all.

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,530
We're first-year university
students, so we had no way of

77
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,850
going up to all these people
and saying, here

78
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,980
guys, here's our app.

79
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,380
We hope you enjoy it.

80
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,840
So the Chrome Store, that really
eliminated that problem

81
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,540
for us, because we just
put the app right

82
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,380
on the Chrome store.

83
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,190
And then instantly whoever
searches Reddit on the store,

84
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,970
they'll see Reditr, and they'll
get it that way.

85
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,780
So it sort of levels the playing
field in that sense,

86
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,420
because big companies who
publish apps onto the store,

87
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,570
they have the chance of people
finding their apps as just two

88
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,545
kids have of people finding
our own app.

89
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:57,710
So that's what we were
really excited about

90
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,730
with the Chrome Store.

91
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,330
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

92
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,300
So as we're going
through today--

93
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,060
I just put a link up on screen,
but for those of you

94
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,290
who are watching at home live,
if you have questions, feel

95
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,100
free to post your questions to
our Google Moderator queue.

96
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:17,250
The URL is just there
at goo.gl/knzHf.

97
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,170
And that H is a capital.

98
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,140
And so a shout out to you guys,
because you guys are in

99
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,830
school right now.

100
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,410
And you're in school out in
the Maritimes, right?

101
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:27,950
In Canada?

102
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,320
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Yep.

103
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,960
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

104
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,200
Very nice.

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,460
What school are you guys at?

106
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,730
DAVID ZORYCHTA: I'm going
to Dalhousie.

107
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,490
I'm getting a computer
science degree.

108
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:37,860
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

109
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,830
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: I'm going
to Saint Mary's University.

110
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,210
I'm taking a mathematics
and finance degree.

111
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:42,520
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

112
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,650
Very nice.

113
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,060
So interesting--

114
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,200
mathematics and finance, and
you're doing computer science?

115
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,551
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Yeah.

116
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:53,630
At first it started off as a
hobby, but then it kind of

117
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,430
grew on me.

118
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,400
PETE LEPAGE: That works.

119
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,580
Awesome.

120
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,690
So as you guys started working
on the v1, and, I guess,

121
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,120
working on your app today, what
kind of libraries and

122
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,510
frameworks were you using
to get the great

123
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,230
app that you have?

124
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,800
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So in terms of
the third-party libraries

125
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,020
we're using that we absolutely
depend on every day, the

126
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,570
answer's going to be jQuery,
just like pretty

127
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,000
much everyone else.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,510
And it just makes everything
so simple.

129
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,090
And we wrote our own library
for interfacing with the

130
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,620
Reddit API, just because not a
really good JavaScript one had

131
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,840
existed before.

132
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,900
So we're heavily dependent on
jQuery and then our own little

133
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,290
library for that.

134
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,170
Other than those two libraries,
I don't really

135
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,130
think we utilized many more,
with the exception of, of

136
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,195
course, the Chrome APIs that are
offered to us within the

137
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:48,930
Chrome extension.

138
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,580
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

139
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,430
So did you guys do the design
work for the experience all

140
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,040
from scratch on your own?

141
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,160
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: In earlier
versions of the app,

142
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,320
everything was our own, but over
time we had people giving

143
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,010
suggestions and everything like
that, so we've used a lot

144
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,996
of help from the Reddit
community and everyone who's

145
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:10,380
been using the app.

146
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:10,600
PETE LEPAGE: Wow.

147
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
That's pretty fantastic.

148
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,880
It's really a beautiful app, and
it's got a really app-like

149
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,840
experience, which
is nice to see.

150
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,900
A lot of people who build Chrome
packaged apps still

151
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,360
think about apps as sort of
websites, and the experience

152
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,570
is kind of still websitey.

153
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,970
But the point of a Chrome
packaged app is that it's not.

154
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,549

155
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,450
It's an installed application
that you use on your desktop

156
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,460
computer or your laptop or
wherever that just works and

157
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,840
feels appy.

158
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,360
And trying to define that appy
experience is sometimes a

159
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,140
little bit tough.

160
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,460
When you guys were working
through that app-like

161
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,040
experience, what were some of
the things that you were

162
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,230
thinking about for creating an
experience and a UI that

163
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,340
looked and felt like an app?

164
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,910
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So one thing
that we hope users notice

165
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,220
right off the bat is that this
is something called a

166
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,380
frameless app.

167
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,860
And it doesn't have the
traditional bar along the top

168
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,110
with the close buttons
and whatnot.

169
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,610
We actually built our own close,
minimize, and maximize

170
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,270
buttons in JavaScript, and we
built it such that we wanted

171
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,340
to mimic the operating system
that the app's installed on.

172
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,100
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, interesting.

173
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,250
So do you change for the
different operating systems?

174
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:30,500
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Yeah.

175
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,130
That's correct.

176
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,820
We do.

177
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,960
So if you'll notice here, you
see the Mac UI up in the top

178
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,070
left, and that's just
like the standard

179
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,310
Mountain Lion window controls.

180
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,365
But if you were to install this
on Windows or Linux, then

181
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:46,270
you'd see a completely different
experience in terms

182
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,780
of the window controls.

183
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,480
And that's something we do in
JavaScript, and we couldn't

184
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,840
actually do that without
Chrome and the Chrome

185
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,860
Extension v2 packaged app, so.

186
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,500
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, really?

187
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,072
Cool.

188
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:00,740
Very nice.

189
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,070
You guys have been--

190
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,780
I guess for about maybe three
weeks or so now-- working on

191
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,000
bringing this app to
a v2 packaged app.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,170
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Yeah.

193
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,960
PETE LEPAGE: What has been
your experience on

194
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,480
doing that so far?

195
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,280
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well, so
far, after we solved the

196
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,950
cross-domain issues,
it's actually been

197
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,200
going pretty smoothly.

198
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,480

199
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,970
The main issue was just
cross-domain.

200
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,230
As soon as we got past
cross-domain, everything was

201
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,081
just smooth as butter,
transferring it over.

202
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:32,570
PETE LEPAGE: So let's talk
about that a little bit.

203
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,530
So one of the things we first
started, when we had our first

204
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,760
conversation that we talked a
little bit about is you guys

205
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,350
had looked at this, and
you had hit like

206
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,020
four sort of big problems.

207
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,890
And content security policy and
cross-domain was sort of

208
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,560
the first one to mind.

209
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,520
What was the problem there and
how did you end up solving it?

210
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,690
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well, the
problem was with Chrome v2

211
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,520
packaged apps, it didn't let
you, for example, set an SRC

212
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,800
tag on an image that went
to an external--

213
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,500
to a different website, and with
Reddit, where links are

214
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,420
shared everywhere.

215
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,760
And if you want to embed an
image into the app, you can't

216
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,440
just link it to the
other website.

217
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,450
So what we did is any time an
image tag comes up on the app,

218
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,940
we just add a little attribute
to it, and then with an

219
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,630
interval, we search through the
DOM for every image tag

220
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,470
that has that attribute, and
then we download it--

221
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,000
DAVID ZORYCHTA: In
the background.

222
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,120
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: In the
background, yeah, and then we

223
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,000
get the blob and then
stick it as an SRC

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,810
tag, and then it works.

225
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,380
PETE LEPAGE: OK, so you're
effectively sort of grabbing

226
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,790
those images.

227
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,760
Now, are you saving them to
disk, or are you just keeping

228
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,820
them in memory, or what are you
doing with them once you

229
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,660
get them from the server?

230
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,480
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: I believe
they're just stored in memory.

231
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,860
I don't believe that
they get cached.

232
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,010
I'm not 100% certain on that.

233
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,730
DAVID ZORYCHTA: At the moment,
I can tell you here--

234
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,780
it's funny, because it sounds
like it's this big complicated

235
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,570
procedure, but, in fact, it's
about 10, 11 lines of code.

236
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,630
So it's actually not--

237
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:12,700
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Yeah.

238
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,900
It wasn't like hours of work.

239
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:22,420
It was just checking if we're
in a Chrome v2 packaged app,

240
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,940
and then just changing a
couple lines of code.

241
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,150
It wasn't that difficult.

242
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,010
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

243
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,170
So content security policy is
sort of one of those ones a

244
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,550
lot of developers run into on
their first try when they

245
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,000
convert an app.

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,920
And it's really about because
these apps have access to APIs

247
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,330
and hardware that the drive-by
web really doesn't normally

248
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,680
have access to, it's really
important to make sure that

249
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,190
users are well-protected here.

250
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,180
And that's why we implement
these rules, so that you can't

251
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,930
go and grab source from
someplace else and start

252
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,710
injecting it.

253
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,620
You can't accidentally have
somebody do a cross-site

254
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,030
scripting attack, where they're
grabbing their source

255
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,870
and inserting it
into your app.

256
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,970
But it does mean that there's
a little bit more fun.

257
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,520
Now, one of the things that I
shared with you guys early on

258
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,430
was the Chrome Asset Loader.

259
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,070
Did you end up using that or did
you end up doing your own

260
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,000
thing after seeing that
and going, oh, OK.

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,030
We see what's going on.

262
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,360
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: We saw what
it was doing, and we just

263
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,730
implemented just a slightly
simpler version.

264
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,450
And then that's about it.

265
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,560
We just [? call ?] one function
every time you see an

266
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,070
image, and that's about it.

267
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,010
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

268
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,120
Interesting.

269
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,010
So what were some of the other
challenges that you guys faced

270
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,730
as you were working through
porting the app over?

271
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,210
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So the other
biggest challenge that we

272
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,905
faced was the accessibility
of cookies.

273
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:55,020
So you can't, through
JavaScript, access

274
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,885
document.cookie.

275
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:57,420
It just doesn't let you.

276
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,260
And that's kind of unfortunate,
because Reddit--

277
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,140
the API--

278
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,920
it's dependent on cookies.

279
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,690
So we had to build a little
bit of a work-around--

280
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,090
like around logging into Reddit
and authenticating with

281
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,540
Reddit, because we didn't have
access to setting cookies, for

282
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,540
example, or even reading
cookies.

283
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,430
But that didn't take that long
to fix that issue, either--

284
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,210
probably only about an hour.

285
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,360
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: First we
went to OAuth, thinking that

286
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,090
we couldn't fix it, but then--

287
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,710
DAVID ZORYCHTA: But we sent you
guys an email, actually,

288
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,510
and you came back to us and
had a brilliant solution.

289
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,640
We implemented that.

290
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,180
So it was pretty straightforward
after we got

291
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,250
your email.

292
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,630
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

293
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,220
So what was that--

294
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,280
so you were using the OAuth
implementation.

295
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,130
And when you were using that
one, were you using the

296
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,600
Identity API?

297
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,630
DAVID ZORYCHTA: No.

298
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,590
Actually we had written an OAuth
implementation earlier

299
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,950
on for another project, so
since we just needed to

300
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,720
implement this for testing
reasons, we used that.

301
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,670
But I think actually in V2
packaged apps, there's an

302
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,720
API-to-Interface OAuth
directly, right?

303
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,180
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

304
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,083
There is.

305
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,070
And it's a relatively new API.

306
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,980
It's still an experimental API,
so if you use it today,

307
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,810
you can't upload your app to
the Chrome Web Store yet.

308
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:16,480
That should come out of
experimental within the next

309
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,470
release or two.

310
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,050
My guess is in the next release,
not the one that's

311
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,620
coming up in a couple
of weeks, but the

312
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,650
release after that.

313
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,520
And that will allow you to
authenticate against any

314
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,250
authentication provider,
whether they're

315
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,210
using OAuth or whatever.

316
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,190
They could be using their
own sort of magic there.

317
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,690
And then there's a second API
that lets you authenticate

318
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,090
against the Google APIs.

319
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,210
So for developers who want to
go and authenticate up to a

320
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,480
Google service.

321
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,260
Say, for example, you want to
store stuff on the user's

322
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,205
Google Drive, or you want to
go and just figure out who

323
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:57,310
this user is, you can use
that particular API.

324
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,690
So what was the solution you
guys ended up using, then?

325
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,410
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So what we
figured out was even though we

326
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,020
couldn't like pragmatically
access cookies, they're

327
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,660
actually being set anyway.

328
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,260
So we actually figured out that
we can make a request to

329
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,090
Reddit and then let them
handle all the

330
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,570
cookie mess for us.

331
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,400
We didn't have to set any
cookies ourselves.

332
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,550
And then it just sort of
erased the problem.

333
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,350
We were really lucky that they
actually did that for us.

334
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,860
PETE LEPAGE: Nice.

335
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,970
Now when you talk to Reddit,
how are you doing that?

336
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,150
Because to do that cross-domain
request gets a

337
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,130
little bit interesting.

338
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,310
Are you doing it with a sandbox
iframe, are you doing

339
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,790
it with a WebView?

340
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,920
What's your communication
process look like between your

341
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,920
app and the Reddit API?

342
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,150
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So every get
request is actually just a

343
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,140
normal AJAX request, and
I believe every post

344
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,320
request is, as well.

345
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,850
They are cross-domain requests,
and we just

346
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:59,310
implement the necessary
restriction removal within the

347
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,830
security policy.

348
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,650
So, for example, every time we
need to access a website URL

349
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,540
on reddit.com, within the
content security policy that

350
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,300
our app uses, it has reddit.com
within that.

351
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,619
So it knows that we as
the developers--

352
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,650
we know it's safe to access
reddit.com, therefore it's

353
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,970
safe for the users to
access reddit.com.

354
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,440
So it started with the CSP.

355
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,670
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

356
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,570
Now let's talk about some of the
enhancements you guys were

357
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,370
able to add because of some of
the new features with Chrome

358
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,350
packaged apps with
the v2 stuff.

359
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,580
Was there anything that you were
able to take advantage of

360
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,260
there to enhance
the experience?

361
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,350
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Definitely
there was.

362
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,950
For one, as I mentioned before,
the frameless app.

363
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,600
So you don't have this bar along
the top of your screen

364
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,230
for the app.

365
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,550
It's just built right into the
window itself, so this just

366
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,570
feels so native because you have
the window controls built

367
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,750
right into the actual WebView.

368
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,275
So that's definitely one of
the coolest things that we

369
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:02,350
were able to do.

370
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,690
And then the second thing is
the fact that you could

371
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,620
actually use Chrome Storage
to store user data.

372
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,450
Now, we haven't implemented the

373
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,200
syncing yet through Chrome.

374
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,950
Right now we actually run
off a shared web host.

375
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,890
And as we get more and more
users, it takes longer and

376
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,000
longer to sync.

377
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,910
But thanks to Google, we'll
just be able to sync

378
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,020
everything through Google and
just eliminate the necessity

379
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,360
of having to juggle syncing
by ourselves.

380
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,480
So that's going to be the
coolest thing we do.

381
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,730
PETE LEPAGE: Now, do you guys
have a syncing service running

382
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,730
somewhere that you guys
maintain today?

383
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,700
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Yes.

384
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,560
We actually use justhost for
that-- it's just a shared web

385
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,150
host, because we can't afford
anything really that big.

386
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,490
PETE LEPAGE: So that's
that a huge advantage

387
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,830
I guess, for users.

388
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:54,900
And being able to store stuff
just between machines and

389
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,450
sessions so that if I'm signed
in on one computer--

390
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,370
hey, here's all my stuff.

391
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,070
I go to another computer.

392
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,410
All of that stuff is
synced across.

393
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,240

394
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,860
Now, do you plan to use
both the local storage

395
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,930
and the sync storage?

396
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,420
Or are you just going
to end up using

397
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,670
sync storage primarily?

398
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,430

399
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,430
DAVID ZORYCHTA: We'll probably
make it so that like only the

400
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,990
essential elements are
synced so that

401
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,470
we're not like clogging--

402
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,160
putting a lot of clutter
into the cloud.

403
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,130
We'll probably take advantage of
both local and sync storage

404
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,370
combinations.

405
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:32,930
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

406
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,970
One thing to keep in mind is
that there is a limit to the

407
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,340
amount of stuff that you can
put into the sync storage.

408
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:45,600
So I think it's something
around 512 items or 1024

409
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,780
items, and each one can be a
maximum of 4K or something to

410
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,030
that extent.

411
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,180
So you can't put the entire
world into it, but you can put

412
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,530
a fair amount of stuff.

413
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,290
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Yeah--

414
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,420
a reasonable amount for a
Reddit client like ours.

415
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,190
PETE LEPAGE: Exactly.

416
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,400
Exactly.

417
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,410
Cool.

418
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,250
And then as well with the
frameless stuff, what did you

419
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,760
have to change to get it to be
frameless so that it didn't

420
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:18,430
have the native bar
across the top?

421
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,700
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So at first when
we set out to do this, we

422
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,470
had no clue what
we were doing.

423
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,930
But actually we just a quick
Google search on Chrome 2 v2

424
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,410
frameless app, and Google
actually has like 100

425
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,980
different projects
and all their

426
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,680
source visible on GitHub.

427
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,440
So one of them happened
to be a frameless app.

428
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,800
PETE LEPAGE: Perfect.

429
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,870
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So we
just went ahead.

430
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,350
We downloaded that.

431
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,550
And to actually drag
around the app--

432
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,560
that's kind of fishy
right now.

433
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:45,860
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: I
don't think you can

434
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,050
see it on the screen.

435
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,550
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Oh, right.

436
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,260
Well, you can just click and
drag the app, and, of course,

437
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,020
that's something you need to
implement as a developer

438
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,480
yourself, because you don't have
the Chrome around the app

439
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,490
to do that.

440
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,030
So it's one line of CSS.

441
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,680
And just looking at the source
that Google provided, we found

442
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,212
that out in about
five minutes.

443
00:21:02,212 --> 00:21:03,060
PETE LEPAGE: That's
pretty great.

444
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,050
So what were some of
the resources?

445
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,660
You mentioned the GitHub
repository.

446
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,620
But what are some of the other
resources that you found

447
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,080
helpful in building
your Chrome app?

448
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,230
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Stack
Overflow, for sure--

449
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,890
a lot of hours spent there
just in general.

450
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,070
Other than that, the Google
documentation's actually

451
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,370
pretty good for v2 Packaged.

452
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,320
And, as I said, like the 100
different projects that you

453
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,530
guys offer--

454
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,180
all the source code.

455
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,370
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: That
was a lot of help.

456
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,458
DAVID ZORYCHTA: A lot of help.

457
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,310
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

458
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,480
So what are some of the things
that you guys are thinking

459
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,010
about adding to this as a Chrome
Packaged App or just in

460
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,800
general feature-wise
in the future?

461
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,180
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well,
we want to see if we can

462
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:53,430
implement like an offline kind
of feature, where it'll cache

463
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,100
like maybe the first maybe
two, three pages of each

464
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,520
column, and if you remember
something that you wanted to

465
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,340
show your friends or something,
you don't have to

466
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,040
connect to the internet and
redownload everything.

467
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,520
PETE LEPAGE: That's cool.

468
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,130
What APIs are you thinking about
will be useful for that?

469
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,640
How are you thinking about
implementing that?

470
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,530

471
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,810
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: We haven't
really looked enough into it

472
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,695
to know exactly what we
want to use, but we'll

473
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:22,335
have to take a look.

474
00:22:22,335 --> 00:22:23,390
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

475
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,020
Just off the top of my head,
there's a couple I think that

476
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,480
will be interesting.

477
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,180
The Chrome Storage Local
would be one.

478
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,790
But there's another one that--

479
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,720
I guess there's two that
are interesting.

480
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,440
There's the Sync FileSystem
which works very much like the

481
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,560
HTML5 file system, that allows
you to store resources on the

482
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,350
user's computer.

483
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,380
So you can store data, you can
store images, files, whatever.

484
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,770
So you can use that.

485
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,650
And because it's the synced file
system, it actually syncs

486
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,580
to the user's Google Drive
account, so they could store

487
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,640
stuff up there.

488
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,000
They've got access to it on any
computer they go to, and

489
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,790
you're pretty much golden
across all the different

490
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,470
devices you might
be signed in on.

491
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,790
Then the other one is the--

492
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,750

493
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,090
and I'm completely
blanking on it.

494
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,780
There was Sync FileSystem
and the--

495
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,580
all right, I'll have to come
back to it, because I'm

496
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,110
blanking on it.

497
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,820
Love those kinds of days.

498
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,310
Cool.

499
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:30,900
So what are your next steps
to get this into

500
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,860
the Chrome Web Store?

501
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,740
What else do you guys have to
do in order to publish it?

502
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,230
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well, there
are some minor bugs with

503
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,090
pulling images.

504
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,420
Like, for example, albums--

505
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,900
they don't seem to
work as well.

506
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,970
The images just aren't being
pulled properly.

507
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,895
But that shouldn't too big
of a problem to fix.

508
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:56,620
It's just looking at
the code again.

509
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,360
What else?

510
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,425
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Really just
minor bugs that when we seed

511
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:02,300
it out to some testers, they'll
be able to give us

512
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,650
some good feedback on.

513
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,530
And we can get back to them
and sort of solve their

514
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,020
problems, hopefully.

515
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,290
And then we should be actually
ready to release then.

516
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:09,740
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

517
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,360
That's fantastic.

518
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,980
And from the time you guys
started working on the v2 app

519
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,180
to getting something working,
how long do you think that

520
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,420
took, all total?

521
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,620
Just to get it working, not

522
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,020
necessarily to have it perfect.

523
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,280
But like, all right,
this is working.

524
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,810

525
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,820
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV:
Within a week.

526
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,730
It wasn't that difficult.

527
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,340
It was just changing
some manifests--

528
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,920
some spots in the manifest, but
really that's about it.

529
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,060
And some cross--

530
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,640
it was purely CSP.

531
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,740
PETE LEPAGE: OK. so CSP was
really the big thing.

532
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,090
And then to get it to that like
place where you're going

533
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,450
to be happy with it, how long
do you think it would take

534
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,900
you, has taken you, to
get to that stage?

535
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,280

536
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,280
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Just in raw
hours of just pure coding,

537
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,310
probably only like eight hours,
considering that we

538
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,990
also added additional features
there as well to make the

539
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,015
experience better
for the users.

540
00:25:12,015 --> 00:25:13,320
So not long at all.

541
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,780
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

542
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,850
That's actually pretty
fantastic.

543
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,740
And it helps, I think, for
developers who are watching

544
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,040
this and considering building or
porting their app from a v1

545
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,180
packaged app or a web app,
seeing real developers say

546
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,350
that this is what it takes.

547
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,293
And this is a great app.

548
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:36,410
This offers a full set of
features, has a really nice

549
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,180
experience--

550
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,700
it really says a lot about this
experience and moving

551
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,950
this forward.

552
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,820

553
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,700
Have you guys thought about
monetization strategies?

554
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,920
Do you plan to make some money
with this, or are you going to

555
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,310
use this to pay for school,
or what are

556
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,210
your thoughts on that?

557
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,730
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: It's
definitely on our minds, but

558
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,130
we're not 100% sure how we're
going to do it with the

559
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,680
desktop, but we're also planning
on moving on to

560
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,720
mobile platforms.

561
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,770
And we're actually
in the process of

562
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,950
doing that right now.

563
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,983
So hopefully either through--

564
00:26:09,983 --> 00:26:12,200
I think it was like
a freemium model.

565
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,800
I forget what the model was
called, but there's a free

566
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,260
version with ads, and another
one that's paid that

567
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,740
doesn't have ads.

568
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,500
But we're not 100% certain
with the desktop version.

569
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,520
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

570
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,900
Well, certainly freemium is
an interesting model.

571
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,710
We're getting ready to release
in-app payments to allow users

572
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,070
to pay within the app a certain
amount of money.

573
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,690
So maybe that means unlocking
a certain set of features.

574
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,940
But actually you mentioned
mobile.

575
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,490
Let's talk about
that for a sec.

576
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,660
How are you approaching
the mobile app?

577
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,450
What are you doing to build
a mobile experience?

578
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,740
DAVID ZORYCHTA: It's funny you
mention that, actually,

579
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,430
because right now we have
a fully functional

580
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,890
HTML5 mobile version.

581
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,350
And it's actually built
for Firefox OS.

582
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,920
It runs pretty well on
Firefox OS, actually.

583
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,570
It was really fun to make.

584
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,030
In terms of Android development,
we're doing that

585
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,280
in Java, and for the iPhone,
we're doing that in

586
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,380
Objective-C.

587
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,470
The reason being mostly,
actually, we just want to sort

588
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:13,975
of like learn--

589
00:27:13,975 --> 00:27:15,770
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Yeah,
get another skill set.

590
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,340
It will be nice to have.

591
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,940
PETE LEPAGE: Interesting.

592
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,270
OK.

593
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,440
For the Android and for the iOS
versions that you're doing

594
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,850
native, are you using WebViews
at all to render any of the

595
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:32,100
content, or are you doing
everything purely native?

596
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,260
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well
for article previews--

597
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,580
so if someone linked to a New
York Times article, we would

598
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,100
use a WebView for that.

599
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,350
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

600
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,480
But everything else is a--

601
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,540
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Everything
else, yeah.

602
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:46,876
PETE LEPAGE: Wow.

603
00:27:46,876 --> 00:27:48,960
That's a great learning
experience.

604
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,650
I'll be interested to hear how
you guys, as you get further

605
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:59,440
along in this project, see how
they compare, and then

606
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,620
maintaining multiple code bases

607
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,910
across different platforms.

608
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,940
One of the things we hear a lot
from developers is that it

609
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,373
is a pain to maintain all
of those code bases.

610
00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:11,960
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Just
especially with only two

611
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,910
people, it's already getting
pretty hectic.

612
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,230
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

613
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,720
One of the things that we've
talked about with Chrome apps

614
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,660
is the ability to be able to
take your existing Chrome app

615
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,480
and wrap it with Cordova,
which is also known as

616
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,110
PhoneGap, and be able to have
a fully fledged version that

617
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:37,730
works for mobile, whether phone,
tablet, Android, iOS,

618
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,470
without having to change
very much code.

619
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,060
Realistically, you'll need to
change a few things, because a

620
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,720
screen this big doesn't
necessarily work so well on a

621
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,090
screen this big.

622
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,080
But that's potentially just some
CSS changes, depending on

623
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,100
how things are laid out.

624
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,100
So that's certainly something
to look at if you guys ever

625
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,140
hit the point where you're
like, uh, we want to keep

626
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:06,610
maintaining this, but not do
three different versions.

627
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,330
Cool.

628
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,670
Well, guys, we're
almost at time.

629
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,230
Is there anything you guys want
to add or anything you

630
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,450
want to share with
the folks who are

631
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,270
watching live right now?

632
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,140
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well, if
you want to follow our

633
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,950
progress on any of our
developments, either mobile or

634
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,790
the Chrome version, you can
visit our subreddit, which is

635
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:29,990
just reddit.com/r/reditr.

636
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:34,960
Our Twitter is just Reditr,
and our website's just

637
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,050
reditr.com.

638
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,850
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

639
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,000
Let me pop that up
on screen so that

640
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,880
folks can see it there.

641
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,450
So if you want to try or grab
Reditr, you can grab it from

642
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,680
that URL that's there
on screen.

643
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,020
And it'll be up hopefully very
shortly in the Chrome Web

644
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,990
Store-- the new version.

645
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,620
The current one works
beautifully, but it is a

646
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,590
Chrome packaged app v1, so
hopefully we'll see v2 in

647
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,810
there in the near future.

648
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:06,860
Well guys, thanks very
much for joining me.

649
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,930
Hopefully this was useful for
folks who are watching, and

650
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,840
you guys all learned
a little bit.

651
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,400
And thanks very much.

652
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,060
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Thank you.

653
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,010
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Thanks
for having us.

654
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,150
PETE LEPAGE: See you guys.

655
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,500
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: See ya.

656
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,750
DAVID ZORYCHTA: See ya.

657
00:30:19,750 --> 00:31:24,972
